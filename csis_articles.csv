1,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/promote-us-investment-ukraines-reconstruction-appoint-special-presidential-envoy,Romina Bandura,"December 18, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This commentary is part of a report from the CSIS Global Development Department series entitled Global Development Recommendations for the Next Administration. 
Three full years into Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine, the conflict has damaged Ukraine’s economy and created immense human suffering. The Trump administration, jointly with Ukraine and Western allies, will likely have to help broker a political settlement to end the conflict while ensuring a long-lasting peace.
In October 2024, President Volodymyr Zelensky unveiled his Victory Plan to allies and the Ukrainian parliament. Beyond stronger security guarantees for Ukraine, the plan includes efforts for economic development and protection of the country’s natural resources. Attracting significant private capital and aligning Ukraine to the West will be critical to stabilize the country, modernize the economy, and achieve a long-lasting peace. American companies can help make this vision a reality by providing financing, innovation, and technological know-how. In this regard, the Biden administration appointed Penny Pritzker as a special representative for Ukraine’s economic recovery, housed in the U.S. State Department. Although her mandate was brief, one of her goals was to catalyze U.S. private sector investment into Ukraine.
Beyond foreign aid, the U.S. government has a set of instruments to attract companies to invest in Ukraine, including guarantees and political risk insurance, equity investments, direct loans, and enterprise funds. With a difficult global landscape in 2025, characterized by competing development challenges, geopolitical tensions, and dwindling foreign aid budgets, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and commercial firms will play a more prominent role in financing investments in Ukraine.
The Idea
Under any expected settlement, the Trump administration can both support Ukraine in its rebuilding efforts and help U.S. business with billions of dollars in investment.
Ukraine will require significant funding to recover and rebuild from the devastation caused by the war. These efforts will involve billions of dollars and, if the next administration takes the necessary steps to actively manage this process, offer potential opportunities for U.S. business and investment. First, as president, Trump should appoint a special envoy to coordinate all U.S. assistance and ensure U.S. businesses have opportunities in Ukraine’s reconstruction. Next, he should unleash the DFC to mobilize private investment, rather than direct assistance, to support Ukraine. Given the magnitude of the reconstruction challenge and the lack of enthusiasm for employing foreign aid, funding to rebuild and modernize Ukraine will have to come from other sources, mainly private capital. Appointing a U.S. envoy that focuses on private sector investments into Ukraine would help the country rebuild and support U.S. businesses at the same time. With hundreds of American companies already operating in Ukraine, the United States can ramp up its business footprint. Even before the war, the United States was a top source of foreign direct investment into the country. American companies are leaders in many sectors, including transport and logistics, information technology, agribusiness, and defense. In addition, U.S. companies possess significant experience in supporting large-scale reconstruction efforts in very difficult environments, including in regions experiencing conflict (e.g., Afghanistan and Iraq).
A strong business sector is the key to Ukraine’s future. The CSIS bipartisan and international Ukraine Economic Reconstruction Commission provided a policy framework to help attract private sector investments for Ukraine’s modernization. Operationalizing this framework during peacetime includes Ukraine undertaking significant governance and economic reforms to improve its business environment, substantial funding for reconstruction projects, and greater donor coordination among the international community. In this regard, the incoming administration has an opportunity to advance American interests while focusing on the reconstruction and modernization of Ukraine.
Action Steps
President Trump should appoint a special envoy, someone the president trusts and who possesses the business acumen and significant experience needed to structure the investment projects required for long-term development in Ukraine. Ideally, the special envoy should be nestled in the DFC, which has the infrastructure and personnel to identify business opportunities and structure deals. This special envoy will also need to coordinate across U.S. government agencies that have deep experience in Ukraine matters, including the U.S. Agency for International Development (providing direct assistance), the EXIM Bank (supporting U.S. exports), and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (conducting feasibility studies and project preparation capabilities). 
The duties of the envoy would include the following:
Coordinate U.S. and donor reconstruction assistance to Ukraine to make it efficient and prevent corruption.
Promote U.S. investment in Ukraine reconstruction, with DFC in the lead.
Strengthen Ukraine’s economy to support its sovereignty and security under any expected political settlement.
The envoy would help catalyze U.S. investments as well as provide added accountability and transparency for tracking these investments. In September 2024, the Ukrainian government launched a single pipeline of projects through a digital platform that compiles and tracks public investment projects. In this regard, Ukraine will need partners such as the United States to catalyze investments to high-impact projects.
Moreover, the envoy can be more active in supporting U.S. investments in strategic sectors in Ukraine. The DFC, established during the first Trump administration, has the opportunity to turbocharge its operations in Ukraine. With the DFC’s reauthorization in the works in 2025, the agency is set to double its credit ceiling from $60 billion to $120 billion. This gives room for the agency to increase its exposure in Ukraine, which currently stands at $1.6 billion. Strategic sectors that the DFC should target include decentralizing the energy system, supporting value-added agribusiness, modernizing transport and logistics infrastructure to integrate with the EU market, and expanding the digital and tech sectors. Although the DFC does not finance projects within the defense industrial complex, it could reconsider this policy given the mandate in Ukraine to enhance the country’s defense and security and the comparative advantage that American companies possess in this field.
Finally, there are key reforms that Ukraine needs to undertake to attract foreign direct investment and align laws and institutions with EU candidacy requirements. The United States should support this process so that Ukraine generates the right conditions for new businesses, including American companies, to invest in the country.

2,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/dont-rush-syrian-refugees-return,Will Todman,"December 11, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"Just one day after Bashar al-Assad’s ouster, Austria announced plans to deport Syrians back to Syria. A dozen European countries also announced that they had stopped processing Syrians’ asylum claims. This is a huge mistake.
Many European states have wanted to send Syrians back to their home country for a long time. Before Assad’s fall, several states had hardened their stance on refugee returns, pushing for Syrians to return even without political reforms. The collapse of the regime has given them the opportunity to pursue these aims openly. Even more Syrian refugees are in the Middle East, and their hosts are hoping for their rapid return after 13 years of war.
However, refugee return to Syria will be fraught with challenges. Rushing the return of millions of Syrians would put even more pressure on Syria at an extremely fragile moment and would undermine the prospect of a successful transition. It could backfire in ways that destabilize the wider Levant, frustrating host communities’ expectations, exacerbating social tensions, and leading to renewed flows of displacement. To avoid a broader crisis, donor governments should temper expectations of rapid returns, formulate a comprehensive strategy for safe refugee return, and provide sufficient funding to facilitate an orderly process. It requires time, not rapid-fire edicts.
Over the past 13 years of conflict, about half of Syrians have been forced from their homes. Most of the 5 million Syrian refugees in neighboring countries have said they hope to return to Syria someday. A survey by the UN Refugee Agency in June 2024 showed that 57 percent of refugees in Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Egypt still wanted to go back. Many want to return because of the challenging conditions in these countries, where historic economic crises have made life particularly hard for displaced people. In fact, 87 percent of Syrians in neighboring countries said their income is not enough to meet their basic needs. Host countries buckled under the burden that Syrians placed on public services, restricted their ability to establish roots, and pressured them to go home.
But conditions in Syria prevented most from seriously considering going back. Although Bashar al-Assad’s cruelty has been well-documented, the videos emerging from the Saydnaya prison provide even more proof of why Syrians were so afraid to go back. After opposition forces broke into the prison, cameras captured starving detainees staggering out onto the streets. Some couldn’t even remember their own name, while a toddler, likely born in the prison, wandered out of a cell in a daze. As well as arbitrary detention and torture, Syrians also feared forced conscription and ongoing instability in Syria.
With Assad’s fall, thousands of Syrians in Lebanon and Turkey rushed back to Syria. For many, the Assad regime was the main obstacle to going back to their homes. Countries hosting refugees have seized on this excitement to encourage more returns, with Turkey’s foreign minister saying millions of Syrians “can now return to their land.”
But despite this excitement, major obstacles to return remain. As well as violence, Syrians don’t want to return because of a lack of jobs and basic services. Even though Assad is gone, Syria’s new transitional government will not be able to fix these problems quickly, especially with international sanctions still in place. The local currency is plummeting in value, and substitute currencies are scarce.
Many refugees also don’t have homes to go back to. Some houses were destroyed during the war, others have new people living in them, and many refugees lack documentation to prove they own their properties. Returning in the winter is especially difficult because refugees do not know if their homes will provide shelter from the cold or not.
Syria is particularly fragile. Even though Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) has tried to ensure the continuity of government functions in areas it controls, the fall of the Assad regime has caused major disruptions. It is unclear who refugees can turn to if they face problems with housing or property rights after returning and if the transition government will be able to provide basic services.
Syria’s political future is also uncertain. A power struggle seems likely, with Turkish-backed groups fighting Kurdish-led groups in the north, exiled political leaders returning, and HTS trying to strengthen its control. Many Syrians fear what HTS rule would mean. While HTS has attempted to assure minorities that they won’t be targeted, many Syrians are skeptical about their promises, given HTS’s Al-Qaeda roots and record of authoritarian rule in northwest Syria.
The shifting geopolitical balance in Syria could lead to more violence as different international states compete to shape Syria’s post-Assad trajectory. Iran has lost influence in Syria, while Russia has pulled back most of its forces. Turkey, however, has become more powerful in the region and is determined to limit Kurdish autonomy in the northeast. The future of the U.S. presence in the area is unclear, especially since the president-elect Donald Trump has said the United States should “not get involved” in Syria.
With so much uncertainty, sending refugees back prematurely will backfire. If the first refugees return only to face problems, their stories will deter others from following. But even more importantly, flooding Syrians back makes the odds of a successful transition in Syria even longer. If too many refugees return at once, it would increase pressure on strained public services, exacerbate social tensions, and undermine the already slim prospects of a successful transition. The consequences would not be limited to Syria. Total state collapse in Syria would force Syrians to flee yet again and put even more strain on neighboring countries, who would likely allow refugees to travel on to Europe.
To avoid this scenario, European states should temper their rhetoric about refugee returns and incentivize host governments in the Middle East to temper their expectations for sudden repatriation. They should work with humanitarian groups to formulate a credible plan for Syrians to return safely and provide adequate funding to help them return to their homes. Although donor fatigue has set in, a surge of support to host communities and refugees now would be an effective way of avoiding the worst-case scenario, which would require a much larger humanitarian response. It would reassure host governments in the region that relief is on the way while protecting Syrian refugees during a time of great uncertainty.

3,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/max-gallien-black-markets-maghreb,Unknown,"December 10, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS podcast published on December 10, 2024. Listen to the podcast here.
Jon Alterman: How much smuggling is there in North Africa?
Max Gallien: Way more than people think. It waxes and wanes, depending on what's going on at the border, and there's been an odd kind of economic obsession with trying to measure it. The problem with that is always that the second you do these measurements, two weeks later they're entirely out of date. The World Bank once estimated that about a quarter of the gasoline that is consumed in Tunisia has been smuggled into the country from Libya or Algeria, but that study's from 2014. That number is not correct anymore, but we can say that across the Middle East and North Africa, there has been smuggling going on for as long as these borders have existed. 
And that smuggling has taken a great variety of different goods and people across these borders. That obviously includes the things that we often talk and think about—narcotics or weapons—but way more often than that it's the things we think less about: gasoline, foodstuffs, microwaves, mobile phones, donkeys, Hello Kitty backpacks, and racehorses. It's a huge variety of goods that are being smuggled, and that often provide an opportunity for income and employment for people in these border regions.
Jon Alterman: Why are people smuggling them instead of trading them in normal ways, or the orthodox ways that we think about people trading goods?
Max Gallien: For some goods—weapons and narcotics, for example—there’s no legal trade route. But, again, these are a minority of the goods that are being smuggled. For way more smuggled goods, there's a formal trade route, but that trade route might be more expensive, might be associated with tariffs and taxes, or that trade route might be monopolized by large actors—by politically connected firms that have a lot of inference in what is allowed to be imported through ports or airports—so it's partly regulatory reasons, taxes and tariffs, but also reasons that are often more deeply rooted in the political economy of the countries that we study.
Jon Alterman: What's the relationship between smuggling these untaxed goods that you're talking about and smuggling illicit goods? As you mentioned: people, drugs, weapons.
Max Gallien: It's difficult to generalize because obviously these dynamics differ border by border, but that relationship is much weaker than we often think. There's been this narrative for the last 20 years or so about the dirty entanglements and dark underbelly of globalization. That narrative often assumes that armed organizations and organized crime groups and different types of smugglers all benefit from a certain porosity of borders—that they're all kind of in cahoots with each other. If you look at the operations of smugglers across many borders and if you talk to them, you'll notice that their interests are often quite divergent. 
The types of goods that people will take across borders are very different. If you're smuggling Hello Kitty-themed backpacks across the border into Tunisia, the experience that you have if you get caught, it's very different than the experience if you have a car full of cocaine. The likelihood that you're going to mix these goods is relatively limited. The likelihood that you're going to transport people who are on watch lists in the same car in which you're going to bring couscous or pasta across is quite limited. Smuggling groups often specialize in certain goods, specialize in certain routes, and there's often not quite as much overlap as we think there is. 
Those smugglers who bring mobile phones across might not only not be smuggling cocaine, but might have very different interests from the group that is smuggling cocaine.
Jon Alterman: Although it does seem to me that if you can smuggle Hello Kitty backpacks or mobile phones and figure out who to pay off, either in terms of the police, or the border guards, or something else, that once you start that way, it can be sort of a gateway drug to drugs or something more serious—that the issue is first finding people who can be corruptible and then corrupting them on a larger and larger scale. Is that something you have seen or are there barriers to that phenomenon?
Max Gallien: That is certainly something that exists and smuggling economies are dynamic. We have seen specific types of smuggling networks collapse in certain border areas. Whenever that happens, it opens up a labor market for other networks to draw on. We have also seen smugglers graduate from one type of product to another. Interestingly enough, what we often see is them graduating from illicit products to licit products: from shady businessmen to a pillar of the community that invests in local cafes or wedding spaces. 
People transition from these networks in different ways, but it's important to notice the avenues through which narcotics or guns are being smuggled and the avenues through which backpacks or textiles are being smuggled. They're often very different. One result of the fact that a lot of licit goods are being smuggled is that fixed rules and agreements and structures have developed. That's partly a function of just the sheer volume that has to come through. You can't negotiate for every backpack with every single corrupt customs officer. 
It looks a little bit different depending on which border you're at, but the common feature is often that there are broad rules on what can be brought through, by whom, for what payment, through which point in the border. These rules are often also goods specific. They will apply to things like carpets or microwaves. They might say you're allowed to bring in two microwaves and three carpets and you're going to have to pay this policeman that much.
They often don't apply to narcotics, so the types of ways in which you'll bring narcotics through the border and the ways in which you'll bring backpacks or carpets are usually quite different.
Narcotics smuggling requires different levels of capital, different levels of connections, often follows different rules, and there's usually very different people involved in it.
Jon Alterman: When you start talking about rules and money, it suggests we're talking about politics. What is the relationship between politics and smuggling in North Africa?
Max Gallien: That’s the subject of my book. It's a complicated and an interesting question because we often approach it with a certain reflex. It's very easy for us to jump to the assumption that this is inherently subversive, that this is undermining states and borders in North Africa.
One of the things that I found when I started tracing the effects of these rules, when I started tracing the rent streams and the income streams that come out of them, was that, in a way, it's been an informal income-generating program for regions that have been excluded from formal rent streams. I found that it really has been part of a very specific mode of state-building in many parts of the region.
Post-independence elites often concentrated formal rent streams in the political center and explicitly tolerated smuggling, cross-border trade, immigration, and other kinds of activities in regions in which they did not concentrate formal rent streams. They often framed their toleration quite explicitly as being a kind of informal subsidy to elicit tacit toleration for formal state-building efforts. So, from that perspective, smuggling is not necessarily subversive; it’s part of a certain mode of state-building. Now, it's part of a particular mode of state-building that comes with certain features, certain disadvantages. I'm certainly not advocating for it, but it's important to recognize that it's part of common history.
It's part of a form of development in which the state is very involved. It’s not necessarily something that's come from the outside, even though it's politically always been very opportune to frame it like that, rather it’s endogenous and central state actors are often very involved in it.
Jon Alterman: Do you see regime type affecting the way smuggling networks arise? Are more authoritarian regimes more susceptible or open to certain kinds of smuggling, and more democratic regimes to different kinds of smuggling? Understanding that there are very few real democracies in the Middle East, and it's on a spectrum, does the spectrum matter?
Max Gallien: Tunisia is an excellent case study for this question. The macrostructure of smuggling that we have seen in Tunisia for the last few decades broadly emerged out of the 1970s, 1980s. There's been smuggling before that, there's been changes since that, but a lot of the larger structures of smuggling, especially of consumer goods into Tunisia from Libya and Algeria, broadly stands from that time. We can look at the development of state engagement and state toleration of smuggling in Tunisia from then to today, and while my work primarily starts at about 2014, we have the great advantage that there's a couple of excellent pieces of work from Tunisian scholars, both before and after that. The interesting finding is that there's more stability than we would think.
States under different leaderships, under different authoritarian rulers, but also under different governments in Tunisia's democratic period have all broadly recognized that smuggling across its borders is an essential part of how borderland communities are currently operating, and that dramatically interfering with that is politically very risky. You will find governments across all stripes and regime types making very aggressive statements about their border communities. It's very politically opportune to frame smuggling as something that's coming from outside, that is subverting the nation, but if you look at the de-facto policies on the borders—the broad toleration of smuggling, as long as it doesn't cross certain red lines, the broad understanding that it's important for borderland communities, which themselves are important for stability and security—it's been pretty constant across regime types.
Jon Alterman: I understand that most of your attention is spent on North Africa, your book is about two communities in North Africa, on the Moroccan border and on the Tunisian border, but I'm sure you have had exposure through your work to other places. Is North Africa fundamentally similar to many places around the world or is there something special about North Africa that makes it different from other places?
Max Gallien: In many ways it's extremely similar to other places across the world. Obviously, every borderland is different. Infrastructure plays a role, the type of goods that run through there plays a role, the political settlements on both sides of the border play a role, but the kind of overall dynamic that I'm observing—the fact that smuggling is highly regulated, that states are deeply involved in it, that it's a feature of a certain type of state-building that is now being awkwardly renegotiated—that's incredibly common, especially across Sub-Saharan Africa. It probably says something about how we study geopolitics and political economy in the Middle East that we have not always been as attuned to that as people in other regions.
There's an emphasis on securitization and there's an emphasis on connecting smuggling to the movement of armed groups, which means that we have not often picked up on these things in the Middle East and North Africa as much as we should have.
Jon Alterman: There's huge global attention to the war in Gaza right now. Gaza has had, according to Israeli accusations, tremendous amounts of smuggling—a whole economy built up on the Egyptian-Gaza border. While I understand you're not an expert on Gaza, when you read about the Strip, does the smuggling situation there strike you as fundamentally similar or different to what you're seeing around the world?
Max Gallien: I would look at Gaza as an extreme case, rather than a very different case. As I said earlier, the infrastructure that we have at borders shapes what happens at borders. The political dynamics between countries shape what happens there, too. In a variety of ways, Gaza presents an extreme case of this reality—owing partly to the heavy fortification and militarization of its border and the heavy investment in infrastructure, and partly due to the imbalances and inequalities. 
Because it's an extreme case, it reminds us of some things that are true across many borders. The first is the fact that smuggling in many ways can have negative economic consequences. But in the context of crisis, it can also bring food and essential goods to people that wouldn’t have them otherwise. We can find examples of that in Gaza. It's also a case where geopolitics and sanctions regimes play a really strong role in how smuggling networks develop.
Iran is the other excellent case study for that in the region, and it's a reminder of the fact that border infrastructure often has unpredictable consequences, and that we don't have a good enough understanding yet of the effects of border infrastructure. 
The second part of my book is on the effects of border infrastructure in North Africa, and it really highlights that some of its primary goals are often not achieved, yet some of its side effects are often particularly brutal for vulnerable and marginalized populations across borderlands. We find examples of that throughout the region.
Jon Alterman: In your experience, are all states trying to stamp out smuggling? Should they try to stamp out smuggling? Should they try to be regulating it in a different way than they are? 
Max Gallien: I definitely don't think all states are trying to stamp out smuggling. All states are trying to be seen as stamping out smuggling. But also, that can be different for different types of smuggling. We can see states tolerating the smuggling of blue jeans, but really cracking down on the smuggling of gasoline because it's undermining their own supply. 
All that being said, states are aware that smuggling has a political function, that stamping it out has social consequences, economic consequences, and political consequences. This awareness explains some of the patterns of where we see cracking down and where we see states tolerating it. Should they crack down on it's an excellent question—but I believe “cracking down” is the wrong language here. The big problem with smuggling is we approach it as a law-and-order problem, but I think it's often a political and a historical problem. It's a legacy. The prevalence of large smuggling economies in a borderland is a legacy of how that borderland has been economically developed or often underdeveloped. 
Hitting that with a stick is counterproductive, and often very poorly received for very good reasons. Now, if we look at borderlands that have been heavily developed through smuggling economies, we don't necessarily find indication of a great state-building model. It's often highly unequal, it often produces enormous disparities in wealth. It's often highly gendered in who has access to these networks. It can produce activities that, even if they’re structured, are often still highly violent. If you talk to smugglers in Southern Tunisia, they perceive parts of their daily job as very challenging and often undignified. So, we don't want to advocate for this as a state-building model.
However, if it's been presented to borderland communities as an economic livelihood opportunity, then just taking that away creates an economic crisis and a sense of historical injustice. People will tell you things like, ""Well, the state didn't give us anything, yet they tell us, ‘We'll open a window for you.’” 
If you close a window, you have to open another window, and that's been one of the most fascinating things to see about what's happened in Tunisia and Morocco as smuggling networks in these countries have collapsed as a result of border infrastructure. There are people that protest not the state that built the border, but the state in which they reside. They protest in Tunisia whenever the Libyans close the border and say to their own government, ""All right, guys, this is being closed over there. You have to give us something else.""
There's a social contract being negotiated here, what I call an “informal authoritarian bargain.” I don't think states should fight it, but should instead rethink the economic development models that they're applying in their borderlands and think about what alternative economic development in these regions look like.
Jon Alterman: How should states engage differently with smuggling and smuggling phenomena in your mind?
Max Gallien: The starting point is to move away from approaching it as a purely law-and-order issue or a purely securitized issue, and instead as a development issue and as something that needs to be developed in conversations with borderlands—with an understanding of what alternative development models in those regions look like. There's been a heavy emphasis over the last few decades on border infrastructure; the number of border walls across the world has quadrupled in the last 20 years or so. There's not any indication that that's been a very successful innovation. I'm German. We have a long history that demonstrates border walls do not always do what we think they will. 
But the alternative to that is more complicated—the alternative of what border regions look like if we integrate them into more formal trade channels, if we try to invest in different forms of infrastructure. We don't have a good sense of that yet. It's because there hasn’t been a lot of work in it. States haven’t been seriously engaging in it. 
But every time I talk to other people, be it people who work in Northern Niger, be it people who work in areas that are traditionally dependent on cannabis production, be it people in any area where a lot of economic activity has been outside of formal channels—and that's a lot of places in the world—we don't have a great set of models for how these things can be embedded into more formal economic rent streams.
Jon Alterman: It seems to me that a large part of this is also that people don't build a lot of border infrastructure to block the influx of Hello Kitty backpacks. They build infrastructure because of the smuggling of people, drugs, weapons, and the consequence is the inability to smuggle Hello Kitty backpacks. There's a need to deal with the illegality—what the port master in Dubai told me one time: “You have to differentiate between legal smuggling and illegal smuggling.” How do you do that as a development task, given the money that's involved in illegal smuggling? As we've seen a lot in America, there is a corrupting impact of the money from illegal activity that people who might have more pure developmental motives are susceptible to, and it ends up bending these economies in that direction.
Max Gallien: That’s exactly the challenge. You're right. We don't build the walls to crack down on the smuggling of carpets or backpacks, but that is the first effect of the wall. One of the things that we see when we look at the construction of border infrastructure in a variety of places is that the highly capitalized networks, the guys who are bringing the cocaine across, they usually have no difficulties getting across border infrastructure. They're capitalized enough, they're usually connected enough, and their profit margins are substantial enough that they usually have no difficulties with that.
We have seen heavy investment in border infrastructure in North Africa over the last decade. We have seen the almost complete collapse of a variety of networks that employed hundreds of thousands of people in small-scale smuggling across these borders with very severe impacts on these communities. There's been almost no indication that drug smuggling networks, and especially, for example, cocaine smuggling networks, have been affected by this whatsoever. If you look at a border like the one between Tunisia and Libya, good luck securitizing it and especially good luck securitizing it without the active support of the border population. 
One of the things that's a really important part of the story of how governments in North Africa have regulated and structured their borders is that communication with the border community has been really important. Information passed to security services by border communities has been really important. Alienating border communities while building infrastructure that's not doing the thing you meant to do has not been terribly successful. 
The answer for highly capitalized networks, including narcotics, doesn't just lie at the border. It's a mistake to think that they can be cut down through border infrastructure. Borders are too large, and these networks are too highly capitalized. There needs to be an approach that looks at all parts of the value chain, looks at the production, looks at the consumption, and everywhere in between.
Jon Alterman: It also seems to me that the approach that you're describing is really almost a counterinsurgency approach—to win the supportive communities, to build trust, to identify who the bad guys are through working with the community and providing an alternative. That's what the United States tried to do in Iraq for quite some time.
Max Gallien: Certainly, working with communities is really important in dealing with smuggling. It has an even stronger economic aspect to it, and even stronger recognition of the degree to which communities have been economically dependent on it, which makes it so difficult to engage with policymakers on this issue, because it also makes it often very expensive to deal with. 
Another difference is the lines that we draw between the good guys and the bad guys—the cops and robbers and all that—are often not that clear. State security services have been complicit and heavily benefited from smuggling across these borders, and partly not merely as a result of individual corruption. Certainly, they have also benefited from it personally, but in part their involvement in smuggling stems from state policy to structure a lot of these things and let a lot of these things pass. 
That is something that border communities are very aware of, and they’re drawing a line, assuming that the state is trying to crack down on them, and the state is the cop and everybody else is the robber. This makes it very difficult to meaningfully engage with border communities on this topic.
Jon Alterman: Max Gallien, thank you very much for joining us on Babel. 
Max Gallien: Thank you so much for having me. It's been a pleasure.

Samuel Cestari: Hello, everybody, and welcome to the CSIS press briefing assessing the collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s rule in Syria and its implications. Today we have a lineup of CSIS experts who will share their insights and analysis on the developments in Syria over the last week or so, historical context, the role of external actors, and what is likely to come next.
A couple of housekeeping notes before we get started. Each of our experts will offer several minutes of introductory remarks, after which we’ll turn to your questions. We’ll also be distributing a transcript of today’s call shortly after its conclusion. The transcript will be made available on CSIS.org.
With that, let’s go ahead and get started. I’ll turn first to Dr. Jon Alterman, CSIS senior vice president, Zbigniew Brzezinski chair in global security and geostrategy, and director of our Middle East Program. Jon, please go ahead.
Jon B. Alterman: Thank you very much, Sam.
If you look at a map of the Middle East Syria looks like a keystone, and it’s a keystone partly because it is such an important location. It borders Turkey, a NATO ally of the United States; Israel; Jordan, a close ally of the United States; Iraq, which has been through so much turmoil. Syria is indispensable to Lebanese security. It’s indispensable to Mediterranean security. U.S. adversaries Russia and Iran have both been investing in Syria for decades, and Syria is absolutely central to the Middle East security strategy of each.
Hafez al-Assad, Bashar al-Assad’s father, shrewdly put Syria at the center of Arab politics. Syria didn’t have wealth, but it had geography, and he was willing to both make trouble and suppress troublemakers. Renowned terrorists made a home in Damascus, but he also explored a peace agreement with the Clinton administration.
Bashar wasn’t nearly as skillful as his father. His initial instinct when he took power after his father’s death in 1999 was to explore opening up. Within a few years, he decided he couldn’t do that and remain in power, and he reinvigorated the repressive Syrian state. It’s worth recalling that as the insurgency in Iraq heated up in 2005-2006, Bashar sent jihadis out of Syria to fight Americans in Iraq. From his perspective, it was a double victory: He was having the Americans kill his jihadis for him and he saw his control over the jihadis’ flow as giving him leverage in negotiations with the United States. In carefully constructed irony, the departure point for the jihadis’ buses was down the street from the U.S. embassy in Damascus.
After the 2011 uprisings, he doubled down on repression – which, in my judgment, was a sign of his weakness, not confidence – and more than half-a-million Syrians lost their lives. The uprisings opened the Syrian door even more widely to foreign interference. Russia and Iran saved Assad from overthrow in 2015, but they established a strong military presence in the country. Russia negotiated a long-term lease for its naval base at Tartus and won the indefinite use of Khmeimim Air Base. Hezbollah came over from Lebanon to help Assad remain in control, ironically creating the very vulnerabilities that Israel exploited in September 2024 to attack Hezbollah in Lebanon. Turkey established its own zone of influence in the northwest, reaching accommodations with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the organization that now seems to be most in control of Syria, and pushing against the U.S.-supported Syrian Democratic Forces in the northeast. And about 900 U.S. troops remain in Syria in the counter-ISIS mission. And of course, ISIS, which has its own international attraction in addition to its Iraqi components remains a real presence in the country.
Arab states and Israel, for that matter, have been coming around to the idea that Assad was the best of a series of undesirable options. He knew – he knew and observed red lines, he was hostile to jihadis, and he ultimately was completely transactional. If the alternative was a failed state shot through with jihadis and a forward base for an unconstrained Iran, Assad seemed like a better option. But that option collapsed in a matter of weeks.
I think there are at least five challenges in Syria right now. One is, how do you unite Syrians, who have been split apart in many, many ways, around some single set of institutions? How do you limit retribution and bloodletting? In particular, Syria has large minority communities who have been protected by the Assads, including not only the Alawite sect that Assad was a member of but Christians and others. How do you prevent the Sunni control of the country from turning into a bloodbath? How do you control jihadi elements who might exploit a vacuum in the country, whether jihadi elements within HTS or jihadi elements in other parts of the country?
How do you deal not only with the existing profound humanitarian issues in Syria, but the potential movement of many millions of people who have fled Syria to come back, many of whom have no homes to return to? And how do you align the various international actors, with all of their conflicting interests, and give each enough to either not upset an agreement or to be too weak to upset an agreement? And it seems to me that there are an awful lot of spoilers in Syria right now, and a lot of potential spoilers. And one of the big international challenges is how you keep everybody closely enough aligned so they have an interest in trying to sustain this moving forward.
For the U.S., this comes to us at a very awkward time in a presidential transition. The Trump landing teams have been slow to engage with the rest of the U.S. government. Trump’s stated goal is remaining aloof from the conflict in Syria, but many U.S. allies have acute interests at stake in Syria. And the potential of problems in Syria to metastasize is large. The U.S. government has the power to recognize Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, HTS, and remove it from its terrorism list. And that’s certainly a tool. I expect the United States to use that tool cautiously. And I would expect the Biden administration to use its remaining 40-some-odd days to both maximize its leverage but also maintain its agility.
There’s no question in my mind that this situation is going to evolve over many, many months. And while the decisions made now are important, the consequences of most of those decisions will not be clear until we’re well into the Trump administration. There is certainly extraordinary opportunity in Syria right now, but there’s also extraordinary amounts of danger. And the world seems very deeply divided at a time when at least some unity of purpose is desperately needed.
Over to Natasha.
Mr. Cestari: Thank you, Jon. Next, we have Natasha Hall, senior fellow with the CSIS Middle East Program. Natasha over to you.
Nathasha Hall: Thanks so much, Sam. And thanks, Jon, for those excellent remarks. I’m going to try not to duplicate any of those. I’m also going to try not to cough, but apologies if I do.
First, I want to take a step back before diving straight into the details here. You know, I’ve been working on Syria off and on, and mostly on, for the past 15 years. And it’s hard to sort of underestimate what a historic moment this is for Syrians, in particular. There is really euphoria, I think, throughout Syria, amongst even minorities that were very, very cautious as HTS had launched this rebel offensive. So that’s kind of where a lot of Syrians are today. But just to take a step back and just to discuss sort of the players that made this happen, I think Jon made excellent points about, externally, how this was possible.
Essentially, we saw Hezbollah leadership decapitated in recent months, the rank and file decimated, and really unable to come to the rescue in a way that it had in the past. Likewise, you saw Iran finding it difficult to actually enter Syria and actually bringing – forcing its militias to leave, which was also an astonishing development. And I’ll get into to sort of why that might have been in a second. And then, perhaps most astonishing of all, Russia not coming to the aid of the Syrian regime. Syria was essentially the crown jewel of Russia’s opening into the international – into the world. It was its way of becoming sort of a great power through its two bases on the coast. It was essentially a launching pad into further, you know, Russian intervention in Africa and the Mediterranean. So the fact that early on, right after Aleppo City fell, they essentially said, you know, we’re busy, deal with it, was quite a stunning development.
On the other side of things, I think the Kremlin had been getting quite frustrated with Assad’s intransigence. The Kremlin had been pushing for negotiations between the Assad regime and Ankara in Turkey to, at long last, reconcile. And it just did not seem that Assad wanted to offer any concessions there, or really to anyone else. And so, in all likelihood, it is likely that Turkey greenlighted this offensive. But I do suspect that all concerned, including potentially the rebels that launched the offensive, were surprised by the advances, stunning advances they made in under two weeks.
Now, on sort of the internal side of things, who sort of launched this offensive and sort of the various other players, so Hayat Tahrir al-Sham is an armed group that has been governing in Idlib for several years now. It has a civilian wing called the Syrian Salvation Government. And by all accounts, it has ruled with an iron fist there. There were actually protests just a few months ago against HTS and Jolani, primarily because of people that had died in detention under HTS custody.
That said, it is very clear from talking with people that are close to Jolani that he’s a pragmatic actor, that he had been sort of a student of other insurgencies. And that’s clearly played out in the offensive that we’ve seen, not just militarily but in terms of governance. It’s likely that HTS and others were using a lot of the munitions that had been dumped on Idlib over the years from Russia and the Syrian regime to reformulate weapons. They’ve been using 3D printers to fill in the missing gaps. And they’ve created this Shaheen drone, which also, I think, helped with the offensive.
All of that said, there was relatively little bloodletting, as far as it goes, given how many people have died over the course of this 13-year civil war. Aleppo City, Syria’s second-largest city, fell within a day. And rebels were actually able to control areas that they had never controlled in the western part of the city, which is very, very significant.
It’s coming out in reports that it’s likely that HTS had sleeper cells that were in Aleppo City. They were able to also probably infiltrate a highly secure meeting that was going on in Aleppo, and therefore creating sort of disarray amongst regime leadership when the rebels entered the city.
To a lesser extent, the Syrian National Army, or the SNA, which is backed by Turkey, played a role, but far less significant here. Of the groups, HTS is by far the most powerful, the most disciplined and the most independent actor. They control many of the financial sort of sectors within Idlib that has allowed them to be a bit more independent.
The SNA, on the other hand, is kind of just a hodgepodge of armed groups, primarily displaced from other parts of Syria to northern Syria, and they’ve been quite thuggish and not as disciplined in the past. And often, because of Turkey’s backing, they do have to do Ankara’s bidding versus actually fighting the regime. And so, to this day, we actually see very concerning clashes between the SNA – sorry – the SNA and Kurdish-backed forces in Manbij and the surrounding areas with Turkish support from drones and potentially air support. And that is ongoing.
Towards the east – and this is, you know, probably the most significant for the United States – you had the SDF essentially take this moment as well to make some deals, to take back villages in Deir ez-Zor that had been under regime control. But most significantly, and I alluded to this point before, they took the Abu-Kamal border crossing with Iraq, which Iran had previously used to send in militias and arms shipments. And so that prohibited that, which was very, very significant during this offensive.
And then, of course, and Jon alluded to this, there is the potential of ISIS. There continue to be ISIS cells, primarily in the central part of the country and eastern part of the country. There are, of course, thousands of ISIS prisoners still in the northeast. And the clashes between Turkey and the SDF are highly concerning for that reason. The SDF, of course, guards these prisons for the United States, for Syria, for the world. And so I think immediately these clashes need to be addressed in order to stem the potential flow of instability if there’s prison breaks, which have happened in the past as well.
So in terms of HTS and sort of what now, we do know that they’re saying the right things. They immediately went around in Aleppo City, which is a very heterogeneous place, as well as Hama, which is also very heterogeneous ethnically and religiously, and tried to reassure minorities, Christians, even those that had lived in western Aleppo City, which was regime-controlled throughout this war, that they would not be harmed. But beyond that, I’ve also heard from people living in the city that they have been invited to join a sort of governing council, which shows an element of concern for inclusiveness, for the future, which is a – which is a positive sign.
They have been doing the right thing in ways that I think the U.S. military didn’t quite do – or, U.S. government didn’t quite do in Iraq, immediately preventing looting, trying to protect government institutions – sorry – ensuring that government employees remain in their posts. These are all really essential institutional elements for a peaceful transition in the days and weeks ahead. You know, that said, this is HTS. And so I think, to Jon’s point on the designation, I’ve heard that the U.K. is already reconsidering the designation. That is going to be really essential for the future of Syria.
If HTS remains designated and remains a group, that could potentially have fairly devastating economic and humanitarian consequences for a country where 90 percent of the population is under the poverty line. And that is even before the hundreds of thousands of refugees that want to return. So that’s fairly concerning. That said, if there isn’t sort of an established framework for negotiations and good behavior now, before that designation is lifted, that could potentially also be a major mistake down the line for Syria’s future.
I mean, in terms of, I think, the – I won’t talk too much about external actors here, but I would just say a couple of – a couple of things. I think the ambitions of external actors really need to be mitigated and limited during this really tenuous period. I mentioned Turkey’s ambitions in northern Syria. Turkey likely wants to go back to the Adana Agreement and reestablish a 19-mile buffer zone along the northern Syrian border. But this will also mean forced displacement of Kurds. So I think really prioritizing some kind of reconciliation between the Kurdish population and Kurdish leadership and Turkey is really essential to avoid further bloodletting, and potentially, again, a reemergence of ISIS.
And then, to the south I’m hearing really concerning reports about Israel’s recent sort of invasion into the demilitarized zone from the Golan Heights, where they are forcibly displacing people in these areas. And it sort of remains to be seen how much of a buffer zone they exactly need. But for now, Syrians are going to have to deal with quite a bit in terms of humanitarian issues, in terms of power struggles even amongst themselves. And I think the worst thing that can happen is we see what we did in years past, which is a Syrian sort of power struggle or civil war term internationalized and become even further fueled down the line.
And I will – I’ll leave it at that.
Mr. Cestari: Thank you, Natasha.
Next we have Max Bergmann, the director of the CSIS Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program and Stuart Center. Max, over to you.
Max Bergmann: Great. Thanks, Sam. And thanks, Jon and Natasha. One of the great things about working here at CSIS is getting to listen to my expert colleagues on calls like this.
So I’m going to talk a little bit about the situation for Russia as well as for Europe. For Russia, I think this is – this is a huge blow, I think, to Russian prestige. And it remains to be seen how much of a – of a broader military and foreign policy setback this is for Russia’s broader objectives globally.
To maybe take a step back, when Russia intervened in the Syrian civil war in the fall of 2015, it was of great shock, I think, to not just the United States but to many in the region that Russia would take this step, and in some ways was a sign of Russia’s return as a great global power. Russia the year before, in 2014, had, obviously, intervened in Ukraine, had seized Ukrainian territory; six years before in Georgia. What we had seen with Russia in the period since the Cold War was Russia trying to sort of regain the territory adjacent to itself, but this was a sign of Russia trying to play the role again – a role that it saw itself during the Soviet period – of being a great global actor and playing a really big role in regional conflicts of which – in regions where it’s not in. And Russia’s intervention, I think, was very significant militarily. It provided significant airpower. It provided ground forces, especially in the form of Wagner, quote/unquote, “mercenaries” – but essentially, a largely state-funded effort that had a real impact on the ground.
And what we, I think, saw here was, basically, Russia, I think, in some – many ways taking its eye off the ball, distracted by the war in Ukraine, not having as many assets and capabilities in Syria as it – as it previously had. But as I think Jon and Natasha talked about, I mean, this isn’t just a story of Russia not jumping up to defend the regime. I think failure has a thousand fathers, and this – it was also the failure of Hezbollah, of Iran, of the regime itself. But what’s clear is that Russia didn’t really jump in to act, and I think in part it’s the lack of resources or limited resources, a limited focus, and also a sense that perhaps the regime, at a certain point it couldn’t be saved.
But what does this mean, I think, for Russia going forward is a big question. So it’s, I think, too early to tell what this means for the future of Russia’s air and naval base in Syria. Currently, Russia’s naval assets – the ships that it has in Tartus – are – have sort of been floating a few kilometers outside of the port. I think they’re just sort of doing that for force protection, to sort of determine what’s the next step. If Russia – Russia has not fully withdrawn from its airbases and from these facilities. If it – if it does so, it’s going to have to do a lot more airlift, air flights out of these bases. So I think it is in a little bit of a wait and see. It has gotten some assurances that its forces won’t be targeted. And I think what they’re probably going to hope for is perhaps some agreement with the new government or new political structure to stay in place. And I think it’s probably going to be incumbent not just on the United States, but upon Europeans and others that want Europe – that would like to see Russia fully evicted from Syria, in part because these bases and ports are critical for Russia’s operations in the Mediterranean and in Africa. So one of the major significant aspects of Russia’s initial intervention is that it has enabled Russia to become a bigger player, not just in the Middle East but in Africa as well, where it has conducted a number of military operations and created, at least from the vantagepoint of the Europeans, a lot of instability.
The other aspect is that this intervention made Russia a real player in the Middle East again. That gave it, I think, much more credibility with a number of Gulf states. It was working along and with the Iranians. And it also meant that Israelis had to take Russia very seriously, which had – which really, I think, negatively impacted Israel’s willingness to provide significant support to Ukraine in the first few years of the war, in part because Israel had to deal with the fact that Russia was in the Middle East, and in a neighboring country, militarily.
So if Russia is evicted from these bases, and therefore sort of pushed out militarily from the region, I think it has real potentially negatively impacts, not only with the Israelis who may be willing to then perhaps to do more with Ukraine because there’s less to lose vis-à-vis Russia, also with the Gulf states where Russia had, I think, really built fairly strong ties. Russia, of course, being connected with OPEC+. And I think there’s a potential weakening of Russia’s broader relationship with the region.
Maybe to talk lastly a bit about Europe, where – because I think this is somewhat overlooked in a lot of the discussion. The Syrian Civil War ended up having, I think, a tremendous political impact on Europe, where after the 2008 financial crisis and the Greek debt crisis, and other – the spread of that, really began – gave rise to populist parties inside of Europe. But they were really fueled by the migration crisis that was, in some ways, instigated by the Syrian Civil War. And that is – has really roiled European politics for the last decade.
Already, in response to the collapse of Assad, we’ve seen the Italian foreign minister and others sort of quickly highlight that now’s the time for Syrians to return. I’m not sure if that will be followed by other European leaders. But I think there is a sense in Europe that perhaps this creates an opportunity to maybe not resolve, but at least alleviate some of the political pressures brought on by what we were real intense waves of migration that have put real pressure on European societies to figure out – to figure out how to assimilate people into their countries.
So I think for Europe this is seen as also a real opportunity to perhaps create some greater stability that then limits refugee flows. And I would expect to see Europe really, I think, lean forward in its engagement with the new Syrian government structures, and hope to really help provide a lot of aid and to sort of further stability, such that a number of Syrian refugees that have come to Europe would be – would be wanting to return on their own volition. And I think that’s something that a lot of European press is currently focused on.
And maybe I’ll leave it at that.
Mr. Cestari: Thank you so much, Max. And a quick note here that Max has to run to another commitment before our Q&A session. So if you have any questions for him, feel free to send them to me over email and I’d be happy to connect you. I’d also like to quickly mention at this time that after our next speaker we’ll turn to your questions. So if you want to ask a question, you can type it in the Q&A window or raise your hand to ask it verbally. If you’d prefer the latter and are on a mobile phone, you can press star-nine to raise your hand. And once it’s your turn to speak you can press star-six to unmute.
Next, we have Colonel Mark Cancian, senior advisor with the CSIS Defense and Security Department. Mark, over to you.
Mark F. Cancian: Thanks, Sam.
I’ll be quick so we can get to the questions. But I’m going to talk about how this effects U.S. military operations. And, as we’ve heard, the U.S. has an estimated 900 troops in Syria, plus contractors. U.S. budget documents acknowledge 5,000 in Syria, in Iraq, and there are about 900 in Syria. We’re spending about $150 million in support of Syrian allies, Kurds, and others. And we have been doing that since, I think, practically the beginning of the civil war.
And those troops are there for two purposes. One is to support the Kurds, who have become a U.S. ally, but also to keep ISIS suppressed. What we’re doing is essentially mowing the lawn; that is, making sure that ISIS isn’t able to regroup in any large way. They’ve, of course, been driven out of the major cities. The caliphate was destroyed. But they’re still there. The last couple of days we’ve seen a lot of U.S. airstrikes going in against ISIS. We’ve been able to do that now because we’re not facing any potential opposition from Syrian air defenses or Russian air defenses.
So it’s also important to note that the U.S. forces are in the northeast part of the country. That’s not where the fighting has been. The fighting has been in the western and southwestern part of the country. So it hasn’t affected the United States. But, of course, at some point HTS will probably try to – will try to consolidate its governance, and then they’re going to bump into these U.S. forces. So at some point there’s going to be some interaction here between HTS and U.S. forces.
And that sort of raises the second issue, which is about, you know, what kind of state are we going to be dealing with here? We’ve been hearing about that. You know, HTS has apparently, you know, said all the right things, made the right gestures. We all hope that that works. But, of course, they began their existence as ISIS-adjacent. And we could have a regime that looks a lot like Afghanistan – a fundamentalist Islamic regime.
We could have a failed state as HTS fails to secure the whole country and the country descends into civil war. And in either of those situations, then you could have a very messy situation where they’re affecting Israel and Lebanon, of course, where there’s now this very unstable armistice; Jordan, where the United States has some troops, and, of course, Jordan is close to the United States; and Iraq, where the United States still has a lot of interest.
So if Syria turns into a failed state, then all of these adjacent countries are going to be affected. Now, you know, what will the Trump administration do about that? Of course, President-elect Trump has said that, you know, this is not our fight. And it’s not. But we do have a fight with ISIS. We do have alliances with the Kurds, and we’ve got lots of connections to other countries.
I think Trump may not be as strong a supporter of some of the other connections, but he is a strong supporter of Israel. And I think that if the Israelis become concerned, then that may strengthen the Trump administration’s inclinations to help out some of the other countries that would be affected if, as I say, Syria turns out to be a regional problem.
And I will stop there and turn the floor over to Sam and your questions.
Mr. Cestari: Perfect. Thank you, Mark; really appreciate it. And thank you to all of our speakers for the insights that you’ve shared so far here today.
So at this time we’re going to go ahead and open it up to your questions.
(Gives queueing instructions.)
So at this time, please let us know if you have any questions. I’ll give everyone a chance to put their hand up if they have one.
OK, we have a question from Hamzeh Hadad. Hamzeh, I’ll open the line for you. Please go ahead.
Q: Thank you. And thanks, everyone, for the great debrief.
I just had a question about if we can kind of get more thoughts from you guys about the potential of conflict between Kurds and Arabs in Syria, just because, you know, the Kurds in Syria are Kurmanji Kurds like those in Turkey. It’s different than the case in Iraq, where there’s Sorani and, you know, Ankara could kind of swallow the reality that semi-autonomy is allowed there. But we all know the situation is much closer to home for Turkey. Any more thoughts on that? Thank you.
Mr. Cestari: Thank you, Hamzeh. Jon or – yeah, go ahead, Natasha.
Ms. Hall: Yeah. I can jump in. Actually, just before joining CSIS I was working on mediation between the Arab tribes and Kurdish communities.
No, there’s a – there’s a significant concern for that. We’ve seen clashes and we’ve seen tensions between the Deir ez-Zor military council, which is technically under the Syrian Democratic Forces, and the Syrian Democratic Forces. They’re, you know, wanting to be a bit more independent from these Kurdish-dominated forces. So we could see that potentially happening again.
The other thing to look out for which I’m quite concerned about is whether or not Turkey sends the SNA – so this is the – sort of the Turkish-backed hodgepodge of armed groups in the north – further south to also sort of instigate clashes there and further weaken Kurdish forces.
So I would say it’s actually quite a significant concern here because there is a history of tensions between the two. Most significantly, I would say, related to resources, many of the Arab communities had long taken issue with what they saw as corruption within this Kurdish-dominated government within, you know, revenue streams streaming to Kurdish leaders and communities and not – and not Arab communities. There’s also quite a lot of tension because of the anti-ISIS campaign in which, you know, predominantly Kurdish forces would go into places like Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa – these are, you know, Arab – predominantly Arab communities – arrest people, detain people, and sometimes either without cause or with dubious evidence, and so this has also created quite a bit of tensions between the communities. So this is definitely something to – a flashpoint to look out for.
Thank you for the question.
Dr. Alterman: And Hamzeh, just as you know, there’s the Turkish government’s concern about the SDF being a front for the Kurdistan Workers Party, and I could imagine that forces aligned with Turkey in Syria could advance Turkish interests against Kurdish forces in Syria not because of some fine-grain local issue, but because of the – because Turkish security concerns in the east.
Mr. Cestari: Perfect. Thank you, Natasha and Jon. And thank you, Hamzeh, for the question.
We have a couple of questions typed out here in the question-and-answer section. First we’ll go to a question from Anna Grobe with the Christian Science Monitor. This is for Mark Cancian. Mark, what might it look like when U.S. troops in Syria, quote, “bump into” HTS forces?
Col. (ret.) Cancian:
 Yes. Well, we certainly hope that that – when that happens, you know, it’s the – you know, the meeting of the forces is accompanied by diplomacy so they don’t start shooting at each other. You know, it would be – but keep in mind also that, you know, the U.S. is there with its allies – Kurdish forces, for example – so it’s not just the U.S. But it’s – you know, it’s a very complicated situation, and you know, there – it’s fraught with possibilities for – you know, for conflict and civil war.
Now, I will say that the United States has been quite emphatic that it will defend its forces. You know, so if HTS was foolish enough to attack the Americans, the Americans would shoot back and – you know, as we did with the Russians. You know, when Wagner attacked or threatened to attack U.S. forces a couple years ago, you know, the United States was not shy about hammering them. So the United States will defend itself, but it’s going to be very messy.
Mr. Cestari:
 Natasha, did you have something to add there?
Ms. Hall: Yeah. I just want to jump in and say, I mean, there’s no significant HTS presence in the areas where there are U.S. troops. So I don’t think that that’s really an immediate concern. I’d also say that we heard ISIS adjacent at one point. Actually, so HTS, you know, 1.0 Jabhat al-Nusra, actually fought – actually fought ISIS in a lot of clashes in eastern Syria earlier on in the conflict. And while there is a $10 million bounty on al-Julani’s head – so this is the leader of HTS – there has undoubtedly been some kind of coordination, because HTS has routed out a lot of potential ISIS cells in the northwest, as well as other more extreme groups than HTS. So there is some coordination there between sort of outside forces that want to curb any kind of ISIS-like threat. And that’s been going on for years.
Mr. Cestari: Perfect. Thank you, Natasha.
Another question here: How does the fall of the Syrian regime leave way for Israel to potentially try to expand its territory? And what can this mean for other interests in the Middle East, and perhaps further instability? Is anyone interested in taking that?
Dr. Alterman: I don’t see Israel having sort of permanent territorial ambitions. I think Israel is interested in having leverage over both Syrian parties but also international parties. So when the decisions are made, Israel feels its equities are respected. I don’t see this in any way, at least initially, being akin to Israel’s occupying and annexing the Golan Heights, which, after all, took place over decades, and after a period of repeated military use of the Golan Heights against Israeli communities. But instead, I see this as Israel feeling like when everybody comes together, Israel wants to make sure that they both have a seat at the table and leverage to ensure people take care of their needs.
Mr. Cestari: Thank you, Jon.
Natasha, did you have something to add?
Ms. Hall: Yeah. I mean, just really quick. I mean, for the audience, I mean, I would just say to pay attention to this, because I am hearing quite concerning reports from Israel’s entrance into Syria and evacuating areas. The last thing that Syria needs is sort of another humanitarian crisis. The other thing that they have been doing is hitting sort of strategic weapons depots. So we saw this earlier on last week with Safira in Aleppo, and there’s been other recent attacks. So I think Israel is sort of meeting its interests on the ground, primarily through air power. And, you know, so far limited, but we will see how that goes.
I would say, as a recommendation, I think on the chemical weapons file it probably makes more sense to work with HTS and others to finally address this, since the Assad regime had also remained fairly intransigent with the OPCW on its promises. And this is really an opportunity to finally truly eliminate these weapons from Syria in a peaceful, and I think probably more effective, manner.
Mr. Cestari: Thank you, Natasha.
And we have another question here from Lauren Morganbesser with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, for Natasha: Natasha, can you talk more on the links between the SNA and HTS, and how aligned their goals and interests are, and how will power-sharing work between them?
Ms. Hall: That’s a great question. So, just a reminder, that HTS and the SNA are essentially sort of umbrella groupings for the many rebel factions that had previously lived, many of them, all over Syria, and then had been forcibly displaced to northern and northwest Syria. And so we’ve actually seen clashes and power struggles between these different groups in this area as they sort of fight for checkpoints and power and sort of revenues as well.
I would say that they have been fairly separate in this – in this particular offensive. HTS, very much with its eye on the prize for regime downfall and the SNA, unfortunately, I think, doing primarily Ankara’s bidding. And, as I said, sort of fighting Kurdish forces in the Manbij area and surrounding areas, like Tell Rifaat. And so, you know, somewhat different goals there. I should also say, SNA fighters have been taken to places like Nagorno, Karabakh and Libya on behalf of Turkey as mercenaries. So it’s unclear, really, if HTS has any control over these groups. I would say the chain of command is far more disciplined within HTS. HTS also absorbs some of these – some of these members of these other armed groups as well. But their interests, at least to date, are not as well aligned.
But these are rebel groups that had previously in the past all been essentially fighting the regime. So I think power sharing is going to be difficult here without really sort of addressing, I think, Turkey’s security interests and really putting to bed sort of the conflict that really keeps erupting along Syria’s northern border, as a result of that really decades-long conflict between Kurdish armed forces and the Turks. I hope I answered the question.
Mr. Cestari: Thank you, Natasha.
Unless anyone has anything to add there, that seems to be all of our questions right now. So I want to thank all of our speakers and participants for joining us for this timely call. Please feel free to reach out for anything we can do to help be a resource on this issue. We’re here to help, so don’t hesitate to reach out. As mentioned at the top of the call, we’ll have a transcript distributed to you all and it will be available on CSIS.org as well. So with that, I hope everyone has a great rest of your day, and thanks for joining us.

5,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/arwa-damon-gazas-wounds,Unknown,"November 26, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS podcast published on November 26, 2024. Listen to the podcast here.
Jon Alterman: How long have you been living in conflict zones, and what drew you to them?
Arwa Damon: I started in 2003. So, it's been well over 20 years. And I wasn't necessarily drawn to conflict zones, but I initially got into journalism post-9/11. I was in New York at the time, and obviously lived the same horror and fear that the entire population went through. But then I also lived through and witnessed the dehumanization that happened very, very quickly, and it was absolutely terrifying.
I am Syrian-American. I grew up in a very cross-cultural household, I always like to say our breakfast being both labneh and zaatar and blueberry pancakes. I felt as if I needed to go into journalism to try to explain people to each other. I ended up in Iraq, and I basically almost never left covering conflict, or humanitarian crises, or just people.
Jon Alterman: What's similar between all these different conflict zones, and what do you find is really different?
Arwa Damon: The dynamics of the wars themselves are always very different. The mechanics of the war are always very different. But there are these core similarities that transcend the borders and the regions from Afghanistan to Iraq to Sudan, to you name it, and that is the way that war and violence and loss and pain scars a person—scars a child.
Then we go back to the difference again: what can we actually do about it? But the pain is something that I witnessed over and over and over again.
Jon Alterman: Your charity, INARA, has a real emphasis on mental health and psychosocial support. What are the acute and long-term practices that are involved, and what are the challenges you find delivering that kind of care to these traumatized communities?
Arwa Damon: We very much focus on long-term medical care for kids who have complex injuries, and we also very much focus on mental health for children. We're a very child-oriented charity. That's our core program. But then when we're talking about emergency situations—look, I'm talking to you from Gaza right now. It's very different, especially if we're focusing on the mental health aspect of this among children, what you can do for a child who is outside of the war zone differs greatly to what you can do with a child who is still living the war and is surrounded by the triggers constantly.
And I'll just give you two examples pertaining to Gaza's children. We have a case of a little girl. She is out of Gaza. She got out. She's in Egypt with her aunt. The bomb killed her mother, and she was in her mother's arms when the impact occurred, and her mother's body actually ended up protecting her. And so, the aunt got this little girl and her brother out. When our team first started working with her, she was completely nonverbal. She was non-interactive with other children. She was terrified of everything and everyone around her. But over the course of just a few weeks, she began to come out of her shell a little bit. She began to interact a little bit. You can see the impact that the focus on mental health has had with her.
If we look at the example of children who were inside Gaza, the triggers are still all around them. They're happening daily, and it's not just the bombs or the drone that's constantly buzzing or the sounds of war. It's also the triggers of loss, because loss defines their existence every single day. Loss of home. Loss of security. Loss of food. Loss of water. Loss of parents as a source of protective stability.
When we're talking about what we can do with children in that context, it's actually very superficial and it has to stay very superficial. It mostly centers around distraction and trying to give them very basic tools to be able to cope with panic and fear. The reason why you can't go deeper is because you can't open a child's wounds when the triggers are so constant, and you can't be there to help them cope with that at that specific point in time.
We're talking on World Children's Day. We just had this big event that INARA organized at this camp that we work at, and I remember—and this is what really stayed with me—it was fun; there were clowns; there were acrobats; there were jugglers; there was dancing, and you see the different ways that these kids interact with what's happening around them. Some of them are smiling, and they have this magical laughter, and it just warms your heart. And some of them have this faraway look in their eyes, as if, you know, they're trapped in this nightmarish cage of the trauma and the demons of everything that they've gone through.
Jon Alterman: You've been in a lot of conflict situations. Is Gaza qualitatively different from other places where you've seen this kind of suffering?
Arwa Damon: I get asked that a lot, and on the one hand, I'm loath to compare conflict zones because, as I said earlier, pain is pain. But when it boils down to it, I've never seen anything like Gaza before. I don't think anyone of my generation has, because it's not just about the intensity of what's happening here. It's also about sort of the absurdity of the fact that so many humanitarians, myself included, and organizations are here, but we can't deliver to the people.
It's the way that sort of everything that is remotely life-sustaining is on life support itself. You can take that from the lack of access to food—and it's not just that we can't bring in enough food parcels. We can't properly purchase on the market because Israel also controls what comes in commercially. We're in a situation right now where we're, again, facing another flour shortage. People have already started demonstrating in front of the bakeries because there isn't enough bread.
The vast majority of people here are barely eating one meal a day, and that includes the internationals, like myself, because how much food can you actually bring in with you when you're limited in what you can carry, and there's nothing that you can purchase on the market? There also isn't enough drinking water. We're expecting rains to come. With the rains, flooding is going to come, except the sewage dumping sites are also going to flood. And so, we need to fortify people's tents.
We need to move the sewage dumping sites, but Israel keeps rejecting the new sites that are being proposed, and we're not allowed to bring in sandbags. It just goes on and on. I went to the ICUs at Aqsa and Nasser Hospital. They don't have enough pediatric tracheostomy tubes, which means that children aren't stabilizing, and they're not able to be taken off of ventilators. They don't even have enough paper for the doctors to write their notes on. They're using scraps from here and there.
No matter which way you look at it, it's this ridiculously absurd situation. It's been called apocalyptic, it's been called post-apocalyptic, it's been called these things, but none of these words encompass what it is that we actually see and experience every single day.
Jon Alterman: You've spent a lot of time with people who have emerged from the acute trauma moments, whether it's in Syria or elsewhere. You've spent a lot of time and effort in Lebanon, which had its own civil war that lasted for 15 years. As you've engaged with those communities, what do you see are the long-term effects of prolonged conflict? The acute conflict is one thing, but a conflict that goes on one year, two years, three years. What kind of effects do you see 10 years, 15 years after the fact?
Arwa Damon: It's very hard for a society to function healthfully when the vast majority of its citizens are deeply scarred by unresolved and untreated traumas. The trauma calcifies. The trauma ends up having a lasting impact, and there's been a series of fascinating studies into epigenetics and the way that trauma actually doesn't necessarily change our DNA but changes the way that our DNA reacts with itself, and that that can be passed down generation to generation. We're not born as these emotionally wiped hard drives.
We're born with the traumas of our parents, our grandparents, and our great-grandparents, and you see the difference in the individuals that have received a certain level of mental health support versus those who have not. When we talk about trauma, it's not about getting over it. Nobody gets over this level of pain and hurt and loss. It's about learning how to function while you're still carrying it so that it no longer paralyzes you, so that you're no longer misassigning emotions and your reactions to your family, your community, your society.
Yes, people always constantly are able to somehow keep going forward because they don't have a choice. But when trauma remains unresolved, you are ultimately building a society that is fundamentally unhealthy, and I go back to these cycles of violence that we keep seeing repeating themselves within certain countries, or communities, or societies. One of the core reasons why these cycles of violence are unable to be broken is because so much trauma has been passed down and has remained unresolved.
Jon Alterman: How does this trauma work in this environment where you have arguably two traumatized populations: Israel and Palestine?
Arwa Damon: You have two very deeply historically traumatized populations, where both Israelis and Palestinians carry generations of trauma that has been passed on along with fear that is constantly and consistently getting manipulated. If you close your eyes and listen to a Palestinian and an Israeli talking, and you don’t know who’s who, you will actually hear the same things being repeated: “They want to kill us. They want to get rid of us. They don’t want us to exist. They hate us. They don’t view us as having a right to be here.” These two societies, communities, nations, people carry with them unaddressed intergenerational traumas. A lot of that fuels into the actions and reactions that we’re seeing today. That trauma and the fear is so easily manipulated, and we’re seeing it manipulated by all sides. We’re basically all just being played.
Jon Alterman: Had you been to Gaza before the war that started in 2023?
Arwa Damon: Yes. I had been to Gaza before in my capacity as a CNN correspondent on a number of occasions before, but always when something was going on, always when there was some sort of bombing that was happening.
Jon Alterman: But you got a sense for the accumulated trauma in Gaza, and now you have a sense for how it's a different scale?
Arwa Damon: Oh, absolutely. You saw trauma in Gaza before October 7. I think it was Save The Children that put out a report that said that somewhere around roughly 85 percent of children in Gaza were experiencing anxiety and depression. What you see now in Gaza is the complete and total evisceration of a person's soul. The light in people's eyes, that energy that we all emit, it's gone. It feels gone, and it doesn't matter if it's a child or an adult. You feel as if their eyes are completely deadened.
It is one of the most heartbreaking things to witness. I remember there was one mother I spoke to, she had come up to me hearing that we work in mental health for children, and she was telling me about her little boy who was about six years old. When the bomb went off, his sister, who was right next to him, was decapitated by the forces of the explosion.
Since that moment, her little boy has not been the same. Every night, he goes into near hysterics and he's rocking back and forth and shrieking, and she feels as if he's on the verge of going into convulsions or a meltdown. She was saying all of this to me in a very monotone tone of voice. I must have looked rather startled because she then said, ""Yes, I know, but my other children need me."" In that moment, I realized that she had also seen this.
She had also seen her daughter's head being blown off. But she could not even allow that emotion to come up as she's retelling the story. She could not even allow her voice to crack because, if she cracked in the slightest, she would just break open completely and would not be able to put herself back together again. So, when you're out on the street here, you realize that people have had to shove down so much just to be able to survive.
Jon Alterman: You've spent a lot of time in the Arab world, and you know that psychology and psychiatry are considered shameful in many places. There's not a lot of resources. What kinds of resources have there been for Gazans? What kinds of resources are there now? It strikes me from what you're saying that the need is absolutely profound, but it also must be affecting a society where the number of people who can provide that service are very, very few and far between.
Arwa Damon: That's part of the challenge. Obviously, all of Gaza's mental health professionals need support as well. Every single person here needs support. I think there is a recognition now among the population about this, and I hear it more frequently than I've heard it anywhere else, given the stigma around simply stating that you need help. But more and more people are very openly saying, “I'm going to need help. My kids are going to need help.""
We are beginning to see a slight shift in the attitude towards the need for psychological support. But it's not where it needs to be. There is still a lot of stigma and shame that is attached to it. The other dynamic, specifically when we're talking about Gaza and Palestine, was something that I hadn't quite realized up until I was speaking to one of our young volunteers in Egypt.
She's from Gaza. She's in her early twenties, and she's a medical student. She managed to get out before the Rafah border closed, and she had this hushed conversation with me, and she was trying to ask me about how I had coped over the years with everything that I had seen and witnessed.
Then she said, “I know I need help, and I want to get help, but if I get help, that means that I'm not strong enough. It means that I haven't been able to stand steadfast against what is being done to us.” That is a huge center of Palestinian identity, this idea of no matter what Israel and the world do to us, we will not break. In her mind, reaching out and seeking professional help meant that she had broken, and that she had failed.
Jon Alterman: One of the things Palestinians are doing, and you've seen this evolve from your time in journalism, is that the role of citizen journalism has really taken off, that people are recording things. Sometimes when I'm watching Arab television, it feels like it's a lot of curated clips. Whenever I see emergency response moments, you can always see people in the frame who were filming it for submission.
You started doing journalism in conflict areas 20 years ago. How have you seen the citizen journalism piece evolving, and to what impact?
Arwa Damon: I think we really saw it jump to the fore in Syria. Back then, it was YouTube, and we actually called Syria “the YouTube war”. Then obviously, platforms like TikTok and Instagram grew exponentially since then. What we've seen with Gaza specifically is, for the first time, because of these social media platforms, Gazans have had, and still have, agency over how their story is being told.
It's the first time that they've really been able to tell the world, “This is our story, and this is how we see what's happening to us through our eyes,"" versus especially if we're a Western audience, it always being through the lens of the Western media, which at times can sanitize the horrors of war out of concerns for viewer sensitivities and whatnot.
I think it has made a massive impact on people's perspectives and understanding of what it really means to be Palestinian, but more specifically, what it really means to live in a place like Gaza.
Jon Alterman: One of the reasons you said you left television journalism is because you wanted to tell these stories in a different way and have more impact. Certainly, one of the challenges is audiences can just become numb when they've seen so many of these. As a former journalist, as somebody who lives with this, how do you get around that challenge of people just saying, ""Oh, I can't feel anymore""?
Arwa Damon: Yeah. It's one of the hardest parts. I think I've always tried to, throughout the course of my career at CNN, look for what I call “points of relatability” because even though people might at some point turn away from the horrible images of the bombings and the aftermath and the injuries and the blood, there are always these points of relatability.
I remember going into Syria, into the province, and the bombs were falling down, and we had done that story over and over again. We always tried to look for something a little bit different. On this particular trip, people were fleeing, and we caught that moment as they were fleeing from their towns and villages. They were exhausted, and they had walked all night, and the kids were just freezing cold and hungry and thirsty. Then it dawned on us. These kids should be crying.
Any other child who was cold, hungry, or thirsty would be crying. Only they weren't. For that report, we kind of focused in on that point because a lot of people can relate to that. One of the reasons that I left CNN was to work on this documentary that actually hopefully does just that. It sort of frames the story of war and what it means to survive war against this epic adventure backdrop of four young strangers coming together to go on a week-long expedition to get to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro.
One's in a wheelchair, and they're from Syria, Ukraine, and Afghanistan. Then as they're going up the mountain, which obviously a mountain like that will push you to the limit and beyond your physical and psychological boundaries, they are forced to address their past experiences and their past traumas.
That is perhaps a way of reaching a broader audience, but at the same time, hopefully, showing them a side of what war does that will surprise them. The documentary takes you also on this, epic emotional journey, where there's laughter, there's this visceral quest for joy among all of the climbers, and this desire to tell the world, ""Even though we survived war, even though now we're labeled refugees, we still want to live and we're going to do whatever it takes to keep living our life.""
Jon Alterman: Because it does seem that one of the challenges of keeping people focused on the consequences of war, is it's the same narrative, the same story every day. It's a building being bombed, it's people not having enough to eat. It seems to be a limited number of narratives, a limited number of stories, multiplied over millions of people.
As a storyteller, it seems to me, it's hard to keep it fresh.
Arwa Damon: Yeah. It is, except every single person's experience with that is a story in and of itself; it's when you really get into who these people are, that we just see in these clips being pulled out from underneath the rubble or in the hospital. When we start to understand that one was a young violinist who picked up the instrument at just nine years old, and one used to love swimming and wanted to be an Olympic swimmer, or the mother who just lost five out of her six children, but she's still cradling and holding on to the one that she has left.
That's why we talk all the time about the importance of telling the human story, the importance of fighting against the desensitization by continuously reminding the audience of who these people are, and that's how you fight back against the dehumanization in this constant attempt to remind people that anyone who you see in any of these clips, they live, love, and laugh exactly the same way you do.
This is, again, what I try to do in the documentary, which, by the way, is called Seize the Summit, and is actually now available on Amazon and Apple and a couple of other platforms. I do hope people recognize that when they're looking at these scenes, every single person who they see inside, at their core, carries the same emotions that they do.
Jon Alterman: Let me end on a more optimistic note, which is, at some point, conflict ends, and people rebuild their lives. What are the seeds you think are important to plant now to maximize the benefit that people feel when we get into the end of this conflict? You have seen communities in Syria that experienced conflict years ago and are now coming out the other side in many ways.
As you look around people in Gaza now, what makes you say, “We really have to do this now, because in 10 years, that's going to pay off”?
Arwa Damon: We need to not abandon Gaza. The level of work that needs to be done here, and you can take it from physical reconstruction of buildings to physical reconstruction of people to emotional reconstruction, is going to be monumental.
There is this deep-seated real fear, and I was actually just talking to a friend of mine about this, and he was saying, ""I'm kind of afraid of the moment when the bombs stop falling because when that fear is gone, I'm going to have to deal with everything and the fear within me, and I'm afraid of how much I'm going to have to feel and confront.""
We really need to recognize that even when the physical war stops, the war for survival—it doesn't. That's when the second war actually begins, and it's won within each individual, each community, each family, each facet of society.
Jon Alterman: Arwa Damon, thank you for joining us on Babel.
Arwa Damon: Thank you for having me."
6,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/reviving-chemical-weapons-accountability-multipolar-world,Natasha Hall and Doreen Horschig,"November 21, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"A week before the 29th Session of the Conference of States Parties of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague, the Technical Secretariat of the OPCW issued a report concluding that it had found a riot control agent (RCA) in the trenches in Ukraine. The report is the latest chink in the armor of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which prohibits the development, stockpiling, and usage of chemical weapons.
Thought to be universally accepted, the norm against chemical weapons use has come under increased strain in the past decade. Cases like Syria’s repeated use against civilians, Russia’s battlefield deployment of chemical agents in Ukraine, and Iran’s reported development of weaponized synthetic opioids reveal an unsettling trend in accountability and enforcement. Some states are testing the limits of the CWC’s capacity to hold violators accountable, while Russia and Iran are exploring new, asymmetrical means of warfare to challenge adversaries.
Next week’s conference presents an opportunity to revitalize efforts toward accountability and global cooperation. The United States, in particular, is in a position to reverse course on the dangerous erosion of the chemical weapons norm and maintain the integrity of the CWC. But to do so, it will need to engage friend and foe alike.
The State of the Chemical Weapons Norm
The chemical weapons norm has become a victim of a new multipolar era. The Assad regime’s usage of sarin and chlorine gas on its own people since the start of the conflict in 2011 brought chemical weapons back to the Middle East for the first time in the post–Cold War era. But it was not a given that Assad would get away with these egregious war crimes a decade ago.
Following a 2013 sarin gas attack that killed over 1,400 people in Ghouta, Syria, international outrage prompted efforts to eliminate Syria’s chemical arsenal with Russia’s cooperation. Yet, accountability for these war crimes has faded from the international spotlight, as has Russian acquiescence to investigate and attribute chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Russia has since protected Syria from accountability and tried to attack and discredit the OPCW.
A decade later, the Assad regime has failed to cooperate with the OPCW on numerous nontrivial issues, including undeclared chemical research, the production or weaponization of unknown quantities of chemical weapons, and significant quantities of chemical warfare agents, precursors, or chemical munitions. In June of this year, the United Nations’ disarmament chief, Izumi Nakamitsu, told the Security Council that 17 of the 24 outstanding issues opened by the OPCW Declaration Assessment Team since 2014 remain unresolved in Syria.
Though Syria has faded from the headlines, Assad’s ongoing impunity for these crimes is rippling throughout the world. Not only has he not been punished for using chemical weapons, but Assad has also won back most of Syrian territory and has reentered the Arab League. In the meantime, some European countries have been sending diplomats back to Damascus. As a recent CSIS study pointed out, his success in the face of such egregious transgressions of international norms may push states to consider using chemical weapons as he did.
Somewhat predictably, international cooperation on arms control and the use of prohibited weapons in war is already beginning to break down. Russia’s transformation on this issue is a case in point. While Putin may be too pragmatic to use nuclear weapons, he has learned from his allies in Damascus that he can test the limits of the international community’s willingness to uphold norms with chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). Russia has continued to use chemical weapons in assassination attempts and reportedly used RCAs on the battlefield in Ukraine. And a Washington Post investigation last month showed that Russia has been rapidly expanding a restricted military facility called Sergiev Posad-6, which served as a major research center for biological weapons, including Cold War experimentation with smallpox, Ebola, and hemorrhagic fevers. Russia’s renewed interest in biological weapons, chemical weapons, and the protection of others using them signals that the violation of these most basic of norms is back on the table.
Even Iran, a victim of chemical weapons during the Iran–Iraq war in the 1980s, has been developing and weaponizing synthetic opioids like fentanyl, creating agents that could incapacitate both soldiers and civilians. In a world where its proxy forces are severely weakened, and its nuclear capabilities are in danger, Iran may pursue other avenues of deterrence and compellence if the threat to the regime becomes existential. In this new era, nuclear weapons may be for deterrence, but Assad has proven that chemical weapons can be used for survival.
In the meantime, great power competitors like the People’s Republic of China (PRC) wish to defy and weaken a U.S.-led order. And they have many allies in that campaign across the Global South. Despite these challenges, finding areas where leaders on different sides of this divide could come together to uphold international norms is essential. Just as the Soviet Union and the United States cooperated on nuclear arms control and smallpox vaccines, upholding the chemical weapons norms could be a similar area of cooperation for the United States and, for example, the PRC.
Strengthening the CWC Amid Global Tensions
Members of the CWC should approach this upcoming annual session of the Conference of States Parties with renewed vigor. First, it is crucial that CWC states parties use these meetings to maintain pressure on Syria to comply with its treaty obligations. Calling attention to the November 2023 decision C-28/DEC.12 that calls on states parties to restrict the sale of chemicals and dual-use equipment to Syria is vital.
Where such multilateral efforts are unable to hold perpetrators accountable, individual countries should advance justice. This June, a French appeals court upheld an arrest warrant issued for Syrian president Bashar al-Assad over the use of banned chemical weapons against civilians. France’s efforts to hold Syria accountable for chemical weapons through its own courts should be replicated in other countries to potentially affect the calculus of other leaders considering chemical weapons use. Furthermore, the member states should work to transfer knowledge from the Investigation and Identification Team (IIT), which was established solely for the Syria case, to the OPCW and investigative bodies pursuing accountability in Syria and the unfortunate next case of chemical weapons usage.
States parties could also address the troubling reports of Russia’s use of riot control agents in Ukraine. Despite formal requests for clarification, Russia has yet to respond substantially, even as it accuses Ukraine of using RCAs and attacking chemical facilities on Russian soil. By leveraging the OPCW’s expertise and objectivity and bringing in perspectives from NGOs, legal experts, and scientists, the conference could bolster evidence-based discussions on RCA use, helping to clarify potential violations. It is also crucial that the OPCW continues to call out Russia’s unsubstantiated claims about U.S. support for Ukrainian chemical weapons preparations. These efforts could contribute to the deterrence of chemical weapons use in Ukraine and uphold the integrity of CWC.
The United States is in a good position to lead some efforts, having destroyed its chemical weapons stockpile in 2023. Revitalizing the International Partnership Against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons could be one avenue, but the initiative launched by France in 2018 is missing many powerful members of the international community that have notably not signed on. The United States and its allies in Europe and East Asia cannot do it alone. Advancing accountability and upholding the norm will require more diverse multilateral backing.
Shoring up the CWC will depend on increased cooperation with adversaries like Beijing as well as allies. The current administration has already recognized this and tried to revive bilateral CWC-related meetings. Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Bonnie Jenkins recently called on China to engage in risk reduction talks with the United States during her remarks at the 19th NATO Conference on Arms Control, Disarmament, and WMDs in Poland. While these conversations are difficult with regard to nuclear weapons, given Beijing’s build-up and U.S. modernization, chemical weapons may be an entry point to restart constructive discussions.
In the past, China has signaled its willingness to engage on these issues. Just this past September, OPCW director-general Fernando Arias met with senior Chinese officials, including representatives from China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, military, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as the vice mayor of Shanghai. They focused on reforming the verification process to address both security and economic needs while considering the geographic balance to tackle emerging challenges under the CWC.
This Chinese interest in preserving the OPCW and preventing chemical weapons use may stem, in large part, from its historical experience. The Chinese had been victims of chemical warfare during the Second Sino-Japanese War when Japan carried out 375–2,000 chemical attacks that killed tens of thousands from 1937 to 1945. No Japanese officials were prosecuted for chemical weapons use after World War II, and China is still dealing with the abandoned chemical munitions by Japanese forces. However, in the past two decades, Sino-Japanese cooperation to dispose of chemical weapons has been useful for China and Japan’s credibility—even though bilateral tensions have sometimes strained the destruction process. This more positive experience and clear Chinese interest in these issues could also signal that chemical weapons could be a politically feasible area of cooperation between the United States and the PRC.
This approach could not only address chemical weapons issues but, if successful, could also lay the groundwork for broader discussions on WMDs. Talks on nuclear arms control and risk reduction have made little progress in recent years. While the United States has repeatedly extended offers to engage, China has been largely unresponsive or tied conversations to U.S. arm sales to Taiwan, and the countries have only engaged on artificial intelligence and nuclear command. However, following a meeting between U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan and senior Chinese officials in Beijing in August 2024, a U.S. official noted that “the conversation is slightly more ripe than it was in 2022.” Discussions on chemical weapons could further build some trust and diplomatic muscle needed to facilitate broader conversations on nuclear weapons and other issues.
It will not be easy, however. China voted in lock step with Russia to protect the Assad regime at the UN Security Council. The incoming U.S. administration also appears to be more hawkish on China, given recent cabinet picks. Still, the new administration will need foreign policy wins and may be obliged to find some areas of cooperation with the second-largest economy in the world.
Renewed cooperation with China on this file could also affect North Korea’s chemical weapons stockpile. While China has been reluctant to use its considerable economic and political influence on North Korea to mitigate Pyongyang’s militaristic behaviors, Beijing could tie essential resources, such as food and energy aid, to North Korea, taking verifiable steps toward dismantling its chemical weapons stockpile. China’s concerns that its relationship is being diluted by the DPRK’s increasing ties with Russia over Ukraine could serve as a strategic incentive for Beijing to regain its leverage while also proving itself to be a more responsible stakeholder in the international community. With its nuclear program, North Korea may also be more amenable to dismantling its chemical weapons program.
A Multilateral Pathway
Finding pathways to reinforce basic norms and arms control in a polarized world is more important than ever. Engagement between the United States and China, driven by shared interests and historical legacies, could reinvigorate international norms against chemical weapons and lay the groundwork for broader WMD dialogues. By uniting to prevent chemical weapons proliferation and use, the international community can help preserve the CWC’s objectives in a changing global landscape, demonstrating the enduring value of and vital need for multilateral cooperation on arms control.

On behalf of CSIS and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the U.N. we are so pleased to welcome our audience in person and online to today’s event, “Preventing, Detecting, and Responding to Animal Disease Threats: 20 years of U.N. FAO ECTAD.” I’m Caitlin Welsh, director of the CSIS Global Food and Water Security Program. And ECTAD, of course, is the Emergency Center for Transboundary Animal Diseases.
Now, transboundary animal diseases and zoonoses might not be terms that you hear or read in the news very often but the issues are making headlines every day like avian influenza, which has spread globally, contributed to record high egg prices, infected cattle and hundreds of other mammal and bird species, killed hundreds of millions of animals, and jumped to humans including in the United States.
Avian influenza and mpox and Marburg and COVID-19 and many others are national security threats because they can have profound and abrupt impacts on economies, human health, the environment, and food security. They require action by these sectors at global, national, and local levels.
We’ll talk about all this today – transboundary animal diseases, zoonoses and the One Health approach. We’re marking the 20th anniversary of ECTAD this month and this week is National – sorry, World Antimicrobial Resistance Awareness Week. So we’ll also discuss AMR.
Here to talk about the importance of preventing, detecting, and responding to animal disease threats are five globally recognized experts and we really have such a fantastic group of experts with us today including Dr. Stephanie Psaki, Dr. Thanawat Tiensin, Nidhi Bouri, Dr. Michael Murphy, and Dr. Erin Sorrell, all of whom I will introduce again when we turn to our panel discussion.
But before we start the show I have three announcements. Safety first. For those of you who’ve been with us before you know that exits – emergency exits are behind me to the right and in the corner of the foyer behind you and to the right. So should the need arise please move to those exits.
Also, following today’s panel we will welcome questions from the audience and we very much encourage those questions. So if you have a question please submit it at the ask questions here button on the event page or if you’re in the room scan the QR code and submit your question there.
And, finally, following today’s event we will welcome you to a reception on our second floor foyer just outside the room.
Now, on with our program. We’ll begin with a short video from the U.N. FAO.
(A video presentation begins.)
Rein Paulsen (Director, Office Of Emergencies And Resilience, FAO): Since 2004, FAO Emergency Center for Transboundary Animal Diseases – ECTAD – has been supporting national governments to reduce the risk of animal health threats that can devastate livelihoods and threaten food safety.
By building members’ capacities to prevent, detect, and respond to these threats FAO plays an essential role in protecting the health of people and animals, transforming agrifood systems and safeguarding farmers’ livelihoods, economies, and global food security.
Thanawat Tiensin: Thanks to the long-standing partnership with the United States Agency for International Development – USAID – FAO work with countries all around the world to increase their abilities to manage animal diseases and enhance productivities and trade in animals and animal products. By helping to avoid national, regional, and global disease spread FAO ECTAD contribute to the protection of people and animals.
(Video presentation ends.) (Applause.)
Ms. Welsh: FAO does do great videos – (laughs) – so applause are warranted.
It’s now my pleasure to introduce our keynote speaker Dr. Stephanie Psaki.
Dr. Psaki is deputy senior director for global health security and biodefense at the National Security Council, a deputy assistant to the president, and the first U.S. coordinator for global health security at the White House. She’s been a generous contributor to CSIS scholarship on global health in close collaboration with the CSIS Global Health Security Center, for which we are grateful. We last featured her on the CSIS stage in April 2024 on the launch of the new U.S. Global Health Security Strategy and she introduced the strategy as a blueprint for protecting American interests and noted that the strategy goes beyond the usual global health programming and sees opportunities in integrating with animal health programs.
In that event Dr. Psaki also noted that, and this is a quote – I’m quoting you to yourself – (laughs) – “Health emergencies impact every sector so it makes sense that every sector would step up to make sure that we’re safer.”
I think this is a great place to kick off our conversation today. Thank you for joining us, Dr. Psaki. Welcome back to CSIS. The floor is yours.
(Applause.)
Stephanie Psaki, M.D.: Good morning, everyone. I’m a little shorter than Caitlin.
Thanks for joining, those who are in the room and those who have joined online. Thank you to CSIS and FAO for the opportunity to join you today to celebrate the progress made through ECTAD over the last 20 years and to discuss how we can collectively advance the mission to strengthen local and national capacity to prevent, control at their source, and reduce the impact of zoonotic disease.
In my current role as the U.S. coordinator for global health security at the White House I work through the National Security Council with partners across the White House and with many partners in departments and agencies including USAID – and I know Nidhi will speak more to that later today – to figure out how to work with partners around the world to prevent, detect, and respond to the full spectrum of accidental, natural, and deliberate biological threats, and the preparedness needed for all types of threats is very similar. In fact, when threats emerge we often don’t know what their origin is so we need to be prepared to respond to all of those.
From day one President Biden and Vice President Harris have worked to end the COVID pandemic and to protect the American people from future health threats. But we all know that COVID-19 was not the worst case scenario that we could face. It was containable through infection prevention and control measures and we were able to rapidly create novel vaccines building on decades of research.
But we are still recovering from the health, social, and economic impacts of that pandemic even knowing that it could be much worse. We know that COVID was not the only health security threat that we will see in our lifetimes. In fact, currently we are supporting major responses from the White House for mpox, Marburg, and avian influenza, all of animal origin.
Climate, demographic, and technological changes and global conflict are driving increased incidents and impact of outbreaks, especially those of animal origin. The continued emergence, spread, and impact of antimicrobial resistance is taking a devastating toll and the willingness to invest critical financial and political resources has waned as global health security competes with other priorities for attention and resources. Understanding and attention is even lower for animal health systems and human public health systems in many places.
So where does that leave us? First, we can celebrate the progress that we’ve made, and we have made progress, spurred on by the collective experience of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic galvanized an unprecedented global response that fostered innovation and unified action by communities, nations, and diverse sectors.
The Biden-Harris administration has led on efforts to harness momentum from that response to strengthen global health security, working with countries around the world to prevent outbreaks when possible and to rapidly detect and respond to emerging biological threats when they occur.
Advancing these objectives is the purpose of the global health security strategy that Caitlin mentioned and that we’ve spoken about at CSIS before and it is tied and built on lessons from COVID-19, but it’s in many ways also connected to the strategy of the previous administration and potentially to the strategy of the next administration.
Advancing the objectives of this strategy is key to what we’re doing and it’s relevant across all of the sectors so I’m going to talk a little bit about some of the connections between this strategy and our discussions here today.
So the first goal of our global health security strategy is strengthening health security through bilateral partnerships. A lot of that work is implemented by USAID and CDC around the world. We know that the cornerstone of global health security is the ability of each country to effectively counter biological threats within their borders before they spread and become a broader regional or global challenge.
We have under this administration expanded our formal global health security partnerships to more than 50 countries around the world. The long-standing FAO USAID global health security partnership is fundamental to supporting our partners for global resilience, particularly in the areas of zoonotic disease and antimicrobial resistance.
This includes efforts to develop and implement locally relevant solutions such as on-farm best practices. The forecast, prevention, detection, and response capacities that ECTAD develops supports the animal health capacities for many of our bilateral partners.
The second goal of our strategy is catalyzing political commitment and financing to achieve global health security. During this administration the United States led the launch of the Pandemic Fund in 2022 established to invest in building stronger pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response around the world. FAO is an essential implementing partner and has an important role to play in the long-term success of the Pandemic Fund.
And the third goal is maximizing the impact of U.S. government investments in health security and complementary programs. This includes, as just a few examples, the Feed the Future initiative that supports research to identify innovative approaches to improve animal health including strengthening animal health laboratories and the animal health workforce, water for development and water sanitation and hygiene programs and initiatives that strengthen overall infection prevention and control in health facilities on farms and in communities.
This impact maximization also means strengthening a One Health approach to global health security including by integrating infectious disease data from human, animal, plant, and environmental sectors.
These goals present three clear, discrete lines of effort for global health security but in practice, as we all know, they overlap and we must work together to address the increasing complexity of these challenges and mobility of infectious zoonotic disease through integrated well-resourced systems and better international collaboration.
So while we have made progress since emerging from the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, continued investment of financial, political, and technical resources is essential to ensure success in building stronger preparedness today, sustainability of these efforts, and resilience to future health security threats.
So in this moment I think it’s important for us to be really clear about why it’s important for the United States to maintain leadership in this space. Disease outbreaks, whether natural, accidental, or deliberate in origin pose a threat to U.S. national security as well as to global economic stability so it is in the United States’ interest to ensure that, one, we are able to prevent, detect and respond to outbreaks at home; two, other countries have the capacity and the willingness to do the same; and three, regional and global institutions including the World Health Organization have the agility and capacity to both prevent health emergencies and coordinate an effective response.
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted gaps and weaknesses in each of these critical areas which the Biden-Harris administration has worked to address over the past four years. In many ways, our approach and even our strategy, as I mentioned, is well aligned with the work of the previous administration.
So while we have made progress since emerging from the acute phase of the COVID pandemic, a lot more work is needed, and success in these efforts will not only make Americans safer and protect our economy, it will also reduce international reliance on U.S. resources and expertise during times of crisis.
So, fortunately, the same world that presents these increasing threats also offers a swath of technology systems and efforts like ECTAD to counter them. It provides a source of hope now and going into the future.
I look forward to hearing insights from the panelists today and I encourage us all to use this important anniversary and this AMR Awareness Week to recommit to the multifaceted challenges of confronting transboundary zoonotic disease.
Thank you all. (Applause.)
Ms. Welsh: Thank you so much to Steph Psaki for those insightful remarks and for laying a great foundation for the conversation that we’ll have up here today.
I’m happy to introduce my expert panel as I’d mentioned previously.
So online we’re joined by Thanawat Tiensin, who is assistant director general and chief veterinarian and director of the animal production and health division at the U.N. FAO in Rome. Dr. Tiensin has held multiple positions within the government of Thailand, the missions of Thailand to the EU and to the FAO, and with the FAO, and he started his career as a veterinary officer.
On stage with me I have Nidhi Bouri, who’s USAID’s deputy assistant administrator for global health. She has served in several positions in the White House including as director for global health response and as acting senior director for development, global health, and humanitarian response at the National Security Council, responsible for the administration’s global health worker initiative, among other initiatives.
Dr. Michael Murphy is director of the division of animal and public health at the American Veterinary Medical Association – AVMA. He spent his career in veterinary medicine including at the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine at the University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine and as a practicing veterinarian. He is also a lawyer.
(Laughs.)
And Dr. Erin Sorrell is a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She leads collaborations across the U.S. government, international organizations, and government ministries to strengthen health systems and she’s applied this expertise at the U.S. Department of State and many other places as well, including in academia.
So welcome to all the panelists. I’m very much looking forward to the conversation we’ll have here today and I’m going to start online with Dr. Thanawat Tiensin.
Thanawat, very nice to see you. Thanks for joining us online from Rome.
Dr. Tiensin: Good morning there and also a good – I think it’s a good afternoon here in Rome.
Ms. Welsh: (Laughs.) That’s right.
Dr. Tiensin: Very nice to talk with all of you here virtually from Italy, and also I’m sure that we will have a(n) interesting session and also to exchange our information and views how we’re going to proceed and work together closely.
Ms. Welsh: Great. Thank you.
So I want to start my first question to you about successes of ECTAD in its first 20 years. We hear in the news not so much about successes but about when things go wrong so can you talk about successes including some examples from the local level?
Dr. Tiensin: Yeah. Thank you very much. Actually, last week I was in Thailand and also with my colleagues from FAO regional office for Asia and the Pacific because we talk about what we have done so far over the past 20 years.
I remember very well that in 2004 when we have a big outbreak of avian influenza, H5N1, across Asia, and FAO called an urgent meeting with our members and also different stakeholders to discuss how we’re going to control and prevent the situations in Asia to make sure that we will not create a pandemic of avian influenza at that time and that’s why the FAO Emergency Center for Transboundary Animal Disease was created after that meeting.
And during that time we know that most of the countries don’t have enough capacities – laboratory capacities, surveillance capacities, and animal health workforce capacities – to control the situation or the big outbreak of avian influenza and how to deal with these contagious or emerging zoonotic disease, and that’s why we support our partners with support of the United States.
We can make change and we can manage the situation at that time, and you can see many countries at that time even that don’t know about the disease. At that time, nobody, even the country’s laboratory – the National Laboratory in many countries in Southeast Asia – they were not ready and even though in terms of the surveillance system and no one have the capacities, and that’s why the support of the United States and also other partners it really make change.
And you can see that today all the capacities that we built together with your support and we can give you some example today, especially during the COVID-19. We know that during the COVID-19 many countries or even the ministry of public health have no capacities to detect or don’t have a laboratory capacity to detect the virus and that’s why many countries used the capacities of the animal health laboratory that get support from the United States to support the human laboratory during the COVID-19. And it’s really proved that the support and also the work that we are working over together for 20 years it really helped us to prevent the pandemic.
Ms. Welsh: Thank you.
Dr. Tiensin: And I’m sure that – yeah, thank you very much.
Ms. Welsh: Thanawat, thank you.
I want to ask one more question before we move on to the panel. You mentioned partnerships and the importance of partnerships to ECTAD’s successes. Can you give some examples of partnerships at the global level, national level, or even at the local level that lead to some of the successes that you’re talking about?
Dr. Tiensin: Sure. Absolutely.
At the global level, today you have heard about the quartet-type organization between FAO, WHO, UNEP, and WOAH that we are working through the One Health approach. And that’s why, even though the situation of avian influenza outbreak right now in many regions, many countries, and that’s why FAO, together with WHO and WOAH, we are discussing how we’re going to deal with this situation to improve our biosecurities at the country level, to improve the surveillance system at the global level, regional level, and country level and that’s why we need a partnership.
We need a strong partnership from different agencies, different organization(s), and also at the country level we need partnerships, collaborations, and better coordinations with our members, with the countries, with others’ agencies that can bring knowledge, can bring experience to deal with the situation of the pandemic or any other’s pandemic that may occur in the futures and that’s why this strong partnership between FAO with the United States or any other partners is very crucial to build the capacity at the country level.
As you know, the FAO have 195 countries and we are operating at the ground level in more than 140 countries with your support as well and that’s why the ECTAD – the Emergency Center for Transboundary Animal Disease – are operating in 49 countries around the world at the moment.
It really make change. It really make impact at the ground level.
Ms. Welsh: Great. Thank you. Thank you very much.
It’s a good place to start my conversation with Nidhi. Nidhi, welcome to the stage.
What is the importance of addressing transboundary animal diseases, or zoonoses, to USAID equities writ large? So not only to global health but to other things that USAID is concerned about?
Nidhi Bouri: Yeah. Thanks, Caitlin, and thanks for having this panel.
USAID, as you might know, is a development agency for the U.S. government. Our approach is to really holistically look at all different sectoral needs that impact communities around the world so whether that’s food security, health, emergency assistance, economic resilience, and when we look at these types of threats – zoonotic disease and transboundary animal health threats – it’s not just about health, and I’ve seen firsthand in a lot of travel that where I’ve had the chance to visit some of USAID’s investments, particularly the work that USAID does in partnership with FAO where we see firsthand that a lot of times not addressing threats and some of the mitigation and then reactions that you have to have in addressing threats as they unfold has a downstream and very quick impact on communities.
So when you look at farmers it’s not just looking at, OK, how do we address the health threat. It’s addressing their livelihoods. It’s when we look at working with FAO to expand workforce capacity to support animal health systems. It’s creating career cadres and opportunities for economic opportunities in the workforce.
So there’s a lot of links in the approach, the One Health approach that we call it, in the international community and how we drive that in USAID’s programs and I think one of the other things I’d note is USAID’s approach isn’t just to think holistically about how sectoral areas come together and really centering it in what impacts communities. It’s also a holistic approach to partnerships.
So just building on some of the comments that have been shared already, different types of actors all have a really critical role in supporting the capacity of animal health systems and animal health systems should not be thought of as different than the health system at large.
It is – they are inextricably linked, and our partnership with FAO has really allowed us to accelerate and deepen the way that the U.S. government can invest in utilizing different types of partners, not just through the network that FAO has but then the related network with community organizations, the private sector, other international partners, because each of these entities have a different role. But FAO has really been able to drive a way of supporting both a country level and regional approach when we look at these threats.
Ms. Welsh: Thank you. We spoke earlier and you talked about this variety of partnerships that USAID supports from multilateral to bilateral programs with public sector, with private sector. Anything else you want to comment about that?
Ms. Bouri: Sure. I mean, one thing I’ll say that – so and Dr. Psaki noted this in the way that the U.S. government’s approach is – is our approach to global health security, and this is true for USAID, is a combination of bilateral and multilateral partnerships.
FAO is probably the only partner or one of the only partners for USAID that actually implements in both ways, at the country level and at a multilateral and kind of global level, and I note that because when we talk about health systems, health systems require very tailored investments depending on what the capacity of a country is and then, obviously, the targets that they’re aiming to achieve.
So we work a lot in the U.S. government in supporting countries, identify those plans and the roadmaps for how they close gaps, and having targeted ways of supporting – whether it’s laboratory capacity, strengthening the workforce, the ability to do community-based interventions, we need partners that have those different networks. FAO is positioned where they actually are able to work across that whole space, but we also then are able to leverage some of these opportunities with the private sector or community-based organizations that might have a different type of reach than we can have alone.
Ms. Welsh: Great. Thank you.
And last question for you before we turn to Mike Murphy is about veterinarians. So why are veterinarians essential to safeguarding not only animal health but human health?
Ms. Bouri: So I feel so strongly about this issue that when we talk about the health workforce that includes veterinarians. That includes colleagues who have the right technical training to support different aspects of veterinary health.
I was in Tajikistan earlier this year where I had the chance to visit labs where USAID has invested in supporting animal health capacity, essentially looking at the capacity of the health workforce to detect zoonotic diseases early and then, obviously, communicate and figure out what you do with that information for early detection.
And I also had the chance to go visit some trainings where FAO was training veterinarians. Tajikistan is a country where there are actually not a lot of veterinarians but that doesn’t mean that the need has gone away.
It’s a country where there is a substantial amount of the population whose livelihood is actually linked to something in the agricultural space, and so having the ability to think holistically about workforce and animal health – the animal health sector as part of environment, as part of health, and, likewise, you know, from other positions – allows us to really think of the continuum of how to support from prevention to detection response because you need workforce at every side of that spectrum to be able to address and mitigate those threats.
Ms. Welsh: Thank you very much.
Perfect segue to my conversation with Mike Murphy. Welcome to the stage. Welcome to CSIS.
A note on AVMA for our audience, because this is the first time we’re featuring AVMA here on the CSIS stage, AVMA was founded in 1963. It’s one of the oldest and largest veterinary medical organizations in the world with more than 105,000 member veterinarians representing over 75 percent of all veterinarians licensed to practice vet medicine in the U.S.
So impressive organization. Welcome to our stage for the first time. I’d like to start our conversation by focusing on something that I mentioned in my introduction but also that we’re reading about in the news every day, which is avian influenza, and we’re reading about the impacts in so many ways on the economy, on food prices, on animal health, on environmental health, so many different things.
But we spoke earlier and you mentioned that there are actually some successes to be held up with regard to biosecurity systems in the U.S. Can you speak a little bit about this?
Michael Murphy: So thank you very much. I’ll touch on, like, how we have a constant surveillance program in the United States first and then come to the biosecurity at the end, if you don’t mind.
Ms. Welsh: Great. Mmm hmm.
Mr. Murphy: So in the United States, and you touched on it in your presentations and other, we use accredited veterinarians who already have a relationship with the producers for these notifiable and reportable diseases, so in this case avian influenza.
So if the producer reports clinical signs consistent with respiratory diseases in poultry samples can be taken. They go to a national animal health laboratory that can do testing for other respiratory diseases in poultry and if there’s suspicion of HPAI that can go to the federal lab that does that confirmation.
Once that – if that confirmation from national vet services lab occurs that triggers state animal health officials to act and sometimes federal animal health officials to do what’s called stamping out, depopulating that particular flock so that the disease doesn’t spread to other animals and reduces any risk of it evolving to become a public health disease.
So then turning to your biosecurity point, investments of poultry producers over the last several years in structural and procedural biosecurity plans in this outbreak reduce considerably farm-to-farm transmission. It was more wild bird introductions than in prior HPAI outbreaks. So the biosecurity investments were helpful.
Ms. Welsh: OK. Thank you. Thanks for that.
You’ve actually started to answer this question but I want to focus specifically on One Health and how AVMA defines and also operationalizes One Health and, perhaps, you can speak about the avian influenza example or maybe other examples.
Mr. Murphy: So AVMA has been an advocate of One Health for a long time and basically sees it as what you have here today, a variety of disciplines working together on an issue, whether it’s locally or nationally or internationally.
We support veterinarians working, you know, nationally with their state and federal regulatory bodies, internationally with the organizations represented here today, and examples of things that – particular topics that we would think of as One Health topics are HPAI, as we’ve already been talking about. Rabies, particularly dog rabies, is an example of a fairly obvious zoonotic disease, some animal welfare, and then antimicrobial resistance is one that’s already been mentioned as well, and there are others just for example.
Ms. Welsh: Sure. Thank you. And on AMR how does AVMA approach AMR? What’s your position on antimicrobial use in animals in specific? Can you speak a little bit about this?
Mr. Murphy: Sure.
Briefly, AVMA recognizes the importance of antimicrobial resistance and sees the role of veterinarians in preventing that further development. Now that FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine has transitioned all the medically important antimicrobials to requiring veterinary oversight we support veterinarians – licensed veterinarians – with what’s defined in regulation at the state level or federal level as a veterinarian-client-patient relationship to then decide whether those antimicrobials are needed in a particular instance and if so what the appropriate one is for that client and animals in that particular situation. So that helps support the veterinary oversight of whether they’re needed and it maintains the effectiveness of those antimicrobials over time.
With respect to progress that’s been made, which you touched on earlier, FDA published in the last month or so what’s called a sales and distribution report of medically important antimicrobials in the United States, showing about a 37 percent reduction in the sales and distribution from 2015 until 2023. That’s not the beginning or end of it but it’s just one metric.
Ms. Welsh: Certainly. Thank you, and thanks for clarifying that AVMA’s position is not to not use antimicrobials in animals, certainly, but to use them as needed.
Mr. Murphy: Judiciously.
Ms. Welsh: Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Great. Appreciate those comments, and happy to turn right now to Dr. Erin Sorrell.
Welcome back to CSIS. We spoke a couple days ago as well and you were talking about a transboundary zoonotic disease simulation exercise you conducted just this summer on the border between Iraq and Jordan and that there were important lessons learned for all the sectors represented and also for the countries represented there.
Can you tell us a little bit about that, that sim-ex, as we called it?
Erin Sorrell, M.D.: Sure. Would love to.
To our knowledge – I caveat that it’s to our knowledge – it’s the first transboundary zoonotic sim-ex in the region and it incorporated a number of nontraditional stakeholders. So we engage ministries of health, agriculture, environment for Jordan, the ministry of water and irrigation, the Jordan CDC, which is under the prime minister’s office and not ministry of health. Jordan armed forces, border, health, customs and immigration. And then from a(n) Iraq perspective health, ag, environment, and border commission, which incorporates both customs and immigration.
And it was a labor of love that incorporated a lot of work on everyone’s part and what we found was that while there is not a copy/paste perspective, right, for the preparedness and response to zoonotic disease threats there has to be an integration between sectors on roles, responsibilities, and authorities.
What works for Iraq might not work for Jordan but in both cases the countries had operationalized One Health at borders and were able to successfully operate this exercise, which aligned also with sim-ex requirements under the international health regulations and the performance of veterinary services pathway.
So both countries were able to actually report the sim-ex under those frameworks and actually get credit for them through those health frameworks. And so it’s, I think, not a one-size-fits-all but how do you integrate roles and responsibilities for the prevention, detection, and response.
What was also really interesting to find was that in addition to the more traditional drivers for disease emergence both countries recognize political instability and climate as key drivers for transboundary zoonoses.
Ms. Welsh: Drivers of them.
Dr. Sorrell: Yes.
Ms. Welsh: Thank you.
So talking about this sim-ex and you mentioned One Health, when we were talking you actually said that the One Health approach was – existed before it was defined and we talked a little bit about the fact that it might be easier to operationalize it at the local level than at the national or global level.
Can you talk a little bit about your thoughts about the One Health approach and then challenges and benefits of working at different levels?
Dr. Sorrell: Sure. I think challenge and benefits to working in all levels from national and international to local at the community level, I applaud and think it’s been fantastic the efforts that have been made to really integrate One Health at the international stage and at the national levels.
Just thinking about how the tripartite is now the quadripartite is massive, and so policies and programs that really look at a One Health approach are fantastic and now we need to match the – what I think has been operationalized One Health for centuries at the community level and think about how those lessons can be applied and scaled up to match those international and national policies.
So I think it’s kind of meeting in the middle and taking successes and lessons learned from both approaches.
Ms. Welsh: Yeah, and you mentioned that it’s easier to operationalize maybe around a kitchen table in a village where these impacts are happening. But I hope that we’ll get a little bit further into this conversation about One Health about how the local operationalization can be supported at the national and global levels.
But last question for you, Erin, before we turn to questions from the audience is about national security, and I mentioned at the beginning that you served for two years at the State Department, that you have that perspective and overlay that onto the work that you do.
Can you talk about the national security implications of transboundary animal diseases and zoonoses for other countries and also for the U.S.?
Dr. Sorrell: Sure. I think our simulation exercise is just case in point to the type of sectors that are really involved from a transboundary perspective and from a national security approach to One Health. You wouldn’t necessarily bring in the Jordan armed forces, right, to a national discussion on zoonotic diseases but, you know, we did and we found that they were open and engaged and very much interested.
When we talk about highly transmissible diseases, whether they impact the agricultural sector or the agricultural sector and the human health sector, there are downward implications both in terms of economy, right? That’s been echoed many times here already today. Impacts to food safety, food security, human, agricultural, and animal health, and they need to be discussed and approached, I think, in a single conversation.
There have been examples of countries banning flights on just the risk of an outbreak, countries banning imports of food products whether that’s meat or eggs just on the risk of an outbreak, in complete noncompliance, right, with the International Health Regulations and other frameworks, and I think that that can either be a political play or just a complete misunderstanding of how diseases transmit.
Either way, that’s a national security impact and something that we should address.
Ms. Welsh: Yeah. Well, thank you.
I do want to turn to questions from the audience but before then is there anything that the panelists would like to comment on each other’s interventions?
Mr. Murphy: I’ll just say I couldn’t agree more about food security and the availability and affordability of food, particularly in areas of the world where disposable income is, largely, spent on food. So I’ll just leave it at that.
Ms. Welsh: I’d agree.
Dr. Tiensin: If you may, I just would like to complement from our previous speaker already mentioned about the national security. You can see that the issues around health security, food securities, at the end it linked to national securities and all the example that you gave to us is really clear because during the COVID-19 outbreak you can see that the food price it become a food security issue.
The food price crisis happened during the COVID-19 and also a lot of misunderstanding about the import and export or banning of import of food products from one country to other countries, and this one is already show us that how the agrifood system is fragile.
We need to get ready and that’s why it’s very, very important, and also, as the previous speakers already mentioned as well about the role of veterinarians because we know that in most of the countries they don’t have capacities.
Even there were some country don’t have veterinary school and that’s why the work of a community animal health worker or para veterinarians is very, very important and that’s why I think this kind of work it really can help us to strengthen at the FAO, together with the United States agencies. We will continue, and I’m sure that we will make a lot of change.
Thank you very much.
Ms. Welsh: Thank you. Thanks very much.
So we do have a couple of really good questions in the audience. I’d like to invite Megan Lewis and then Andrew Bisson to ask questions.
Megan, would you mind raising your hand and Andrew as well? Great. Megan’s right here and Andrew. Great. And we’ll take both at the same time and then we’ll turn to panelists for responses.
Q: Thank you all so much. This has been a really helpful presentation. I’m wondering if you could speak to some of the gaps in our current surveillance system when it comes to the One Health approach and how this data is all integrated and how it impacts both animal and human health.
Ms. Welsh: Great. Thank you. And over to Andrew for questions.
Q: Hello, everyone. Thanks so much for this event. Really, really important topic.
I’m Andrew Bisson. I’m a livestock advisor now with USAID but I worked for ECTAD in the avian influenza outbreak in Southeast Asia going back to the beginning of this 20-year period.
When I arrived in Vietnam I think some part of us was alarmed by what we were seeing in terms of the outbreak of avian influenza. And I think perhaps the strongest feeling was not that there was an outbreak, but that it hadn’t happened sooner because of the way that the farm systems were evolving. They were cooking up a lot of pretty high risks.
So I wonder – playing forward 20 years, we’re seeing great growth in animal source food production around the world, particularly in emerging economies. Are we investing enough in the just food transition that it’s also a safe food transition? That the structural development of animal source food production is such that we’re not increasing the risks of emerging diseases but, rather, we’re trying to reduce it?
Have we got the balance right between the investments upstream in risk reduction and then in sort of emergence at the farm gate level and then the transition across to humans? How are we allocating the resources? How do we make those decisions? And are we getting enough upstream?
Ms. Welsh: Thank you. Two great questions. I’ll turn it – whoever would like to start.
Ms. Bouri: I’m happy to start. Thanks for those questions. Just a few comments.
The USAID focuses on global investments so we don’t work here in the United States. But a couple things that I would say is – one is assessing capacity is not a onetime exercise. You have to consistently and regularly be assessing capacity of a system and then tailoring the way that gaps are addressed.
So, for example, an example that I like to speak to a lot is USAID’s investment as part of a U.S. government investment in the DRC. In 2017-2018 Ebola hit DRC. Ebola, sadly, is not a stranger to this part of Africa, and there were thousands of people who died and it was weeks before we had really adequate detection capacity.
You fast forward five years to 2022 when Ebola hit again, and because of investments, largely, from USAID and CDC to improve diagnosis capacity the virus was detected within 48 hours and five people died.
So when we talk about cost effectiveness it’s not just, obviously, the expense that you put into mounting a pretty significant effort to get a disease under control once it starts to spiral. It’s also, obviously, a direct impact on people and on human health, right, and the workforce that you have to mobilize on kind of every sector that might be impacted.
And so I note that because when we talk about gaps in surveillance specifically the answer depends on the country you’re talking about and when you’re asking the question, and we have a lot of focus rightfully on supporting countries to have national plans. But plans only get you so far if you take what you find on paper and you do something about it.
And so that’s where I think having this approach to utilizing different types of partnerships, particularly as FAO has spoken a lot to starting at the community health level, looking at community health, community animal health workers, all the way up to training technicians and labs and looking at that throughput but then also the way that human health surveillance and animal health surveillance come together.
This summer my counterpart at CDC and I were in Guatemala where USAID and CDC are jointly investing in the national lab and it was an interesting site visit because on one side USAID is investing on animal health surveillance and you walk about a hundred feet and CDC is investing in human health surveillance. And that is a great model, but it’s not what happens in all parts of the world.
And so having that throughput where you have not just the capacity that is built up – whether it’s in, you know, the detection capacity and running through kind of what you do with that information – but having a workforce that talks to each other, where you have ministries that actually talk to each other because typically this work is not all under one part of a national government, is really important to addressing this question about threats.
And just briefly on the food supply question, which I’m sure others will want to come in too, you know, I think of food supply in kind of – in two ways. So, one, there’s the global food supply when you’re talking about real trade, kind of moving products around outside of borders, and then there’s the way that most communities in the world get their food, which are informal food supply networks and systems, right – local markets.
When we think of reducing threats it’s a very different list of things when you’re talking about community members walking to a local market where there are probably not a standardized way of approaching food safety practices as opposed to products that are prepared for formal export.
And so I would say we have to think a bit specifically when we’re talking about how food moves and have very different ways of looking at it according(ly).
Ms. Welsh: Yeah. Great. Thank you.
Erin? Mike?
Mr. Murphy: Go ahead.
Dr. Sorrell: If I could just add a little bit to Nidhi’s comment about surveillance. I think what’s interesting is everywhere I’ve had the pleasure of working ministries of health have zoonotic disease units. Ministries of ag do not, right, for obvious reasons.
And so how do you look at tying some of the most critical agricultural diseases – animal diseases – to ministries of health and understand potentially downward impacts to public health and why it’s important to share that information and how to link surveillance systems, whether they can be completely integrated or at least there’s that coordination of we have this suspect event or we have a confirmed case if we’re able to have proper laboratory confirmation.
So I think just starting those conversations earlier than later is really key to bringing everyone together for a prompt response.
Ms. Welsh: OK. Thank you, Erin.
Mike, anything?
Mr. Murphy: Just very briefly. Agree with comments made, and the United States has a very robust system, as I’m sure you all know, and there are things that would work here that may not work in other countries, to your point.
And so biosecurity that’s been enhanced here to the extent that’s useful is fine and not – I agree that you need to. Even in the U.S. we still do tabletop exercises and discover things and we have natural disasters which discover things, that we have gaps and we still need to work with that.
And then, lastly, I’d just offer the alternative that in the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the U.S. the national animal health laboratories offered surge capacity and provided it for human testing because they’re so accustomed to doing high throughput for notifiable reportable diseases and even here that surge capacity was useful. So –
Ms. Welsh: Great. Thank you, all.
Two more great questions. One is online and I’ll read that question, and then the other one from someone who’s in the audience and I’ll invite that person to ask a question.
The question online from Ohio State University is about safe handling and disposing and recycling. The question is: What are the international efforts on safe handling, disposal, and recycling of animal mortalities during disease outbreaks?
And then the question in the room is from Mary Denigan-Macauley in person. Where is Mary? Great. Mary, over to you.
This is about strengthening the strategic partnerships.
Q: Yes. Thank you very much. Mary Denigan-Macauley with the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
Great conversation today. We’ve talked a lot about the importance of strategic partnerships and I’m wondering if you all can talk about ways that they need to be strengthened or are the existing partnerships sufficient. And my interest is admittedly on the surveillance side here in the United States and how we can work better with our partners.
Ms. Welsh: Yeah. Great. Thank you very much. Two great questions.
Over to the panel. Would somebody like to start?
Dr. Tiensin: I’m happy to, if you don’t mind.
Ms. Welsh: Oh. Thank you, Thanawat. Thank you. Yes.
Dr. Tiensin: OK. Thank you very much.
I think I can combine the previous question about partnership and also another comment from colleagues. We used to work in Southeast Asia. I think this – and also linked to another question about sharing surveillance data from human health sectors and animal health sectors.
I can give you a good example. During the outbreak in Asia of avian influenza you can see that we received the report of human case in some countries, in some regions, but at the same time we didn’t get any information or data about the case of avian influenza in animals, and sometimes when we received the data of avian influenza in chickens or any other animals that our counterpart from medical doctors or public health they didn’t receive those data or those information.
And you can see that this one is the gap and that’s why working through One Health approach it really can help us and that’s why, as previous speaker already mentions and that’s why two sectors need to talk and in some case, for example, when it linked to wildlife or wild birds.
Both ministry – ministry of health and ministry of agriculture – also have no authority to collect sample from those wildlife or wild birds. That’s why we need to work with our counterpart from the ministry of environment. And that’s why I think the work that we are working together it really can make a lot of change.
And even though when you’re talking about antimicrobial resistance or even though about the disease – the highly transmissible disease – and we know that if we want to prevent those kind of disease in animal farms we also need to improve the good animal husbandry practices at the farm level that we can reduce the need of antimicrobials.
We can prevent better – we can have a better by all the securities and that’s why this year FAO introduced the framework of sustainable livestock transformation. We need to transform the way that we produce. We can produce better and we can reduce the risk or threat – biological threat to human or to animals, and even though today our consumers and policy makers meet not only for animal health or animal disease, they’re talking about lower carbon production. They’re talking about animal welfare. They’re talking about any other issues’ environmental impact. And that’s why One Health really can approach – can really bring all sectors to discuss around the issues –
Ms. Welsh: Thank you.
Dr. Tiensin: – human health, animal health, planet health, and so on.
Thank you very much.
Ms. Welsh: Great. Thank you. Thank you, Thanawat. Thank you.
I want to see if the panelists would like to respond to those questions.
Ms. Bouri: Let me make a quick comment. So if you don’t think of One Health you’re not actually preparing for health threats. I mean, I think if we – we’ve seen the data. Seventy-five percent of diseases originate from animals. So if you’re not thinking of that interface of human and animal health you’re just not actually preparing a health system.
But the one comment I’ll make just to actually both of the questions is we typically talk about the interface that needs to happen, for example, in countries between ministries, bringing the human and animal health side together. But what we don’t often talk about is also engaging up and down within a country – the municipal level up to a national level.
So sanitation practices, disposal practices, things like that, sometimes are the responsibility of the municipal government and if there is a disconnect, which is not uncommon no matter what country you’re talking about, between a national kind of vision that can come from a ministerial level and then what is actually happening then, again, there might be some real gaps that pose immediate threats or can pose threats to your ability to really quickly stop something at its source.
Ms. Welsh: Thank you.
Mr. Murphy: I agree with everything you just said – (laughter) – and so I’ll give some more context to it in HPAI with depopulating a flock.
The question is do you own the land that you can then compost those birds on and can you get the time and temperature to inactivate the virus on your own property so you’re not going down the road and spreading it more, or do you not and is it geographically not feasible, or some portion of the government, whether it’s municipal or another agency, requires you to take it down the road and dispose of it another way.
Those are – there’s not a one-size-fits-all to the question from the folks in Ohio, I guess, is my view. (Laughter.)
Dr. Sorrell: Yeah, agree with everything, and only to add I think field biosafety is something that we don’t consider.
Mr. Murphy: Yes, that’s my view. (Laughter.)
Dr. Sorrell: Yeah. Agree with everything and only to add I think field biosafety is something that we don’t consider in outbreak response both from a human EPI and an animal EPI perspective, and so I think incorporating that into containment and then response, particularly with carcass removal and including municipalities who may not be involved in any other part of a response, I think is critical.
Ms. Welsh: Great. Thank you. Thanks very much.
So we have one last question from the audience. I’d like to hear this question – this is from Willy Valdivia – and then I’d like the panelists to respond and then just take 30 seconds or so to make any last comments, anything that you wanted to say that we didn’t get a chance to get to, any questions you wanted to ask that we didn’t get a chance to ask.
So I’d like to hear the question.
Q: Thank you.
Ms. Welsh: Great.
Q: The question refers to food supply, trade, and border security. While we report diseases – so countries are bound to report diseases to FAO – there is also the consequences of reporting some diseases and affecting trade, and I wonder what policies we need to address in order to actually encourage the reporting of – the report of diseases rather than the delay in the reporting of these events.
Ms. Welsh: Great. Thank you for that question, and we’ll go in reverse order of the panel so starting with Erin and then Mike, Nidhi, and then to Thanawat. Again, 30 seconds to respond to this question and anything else you’d like to say.
Dr. Sorrell: Definitely the easiest question of the day. (Laughter.)
No, I – you know, I think it’s hard because there are many systems in place that don’t have accountability mechanisms so how do you encourage nations to be accountable for outbreaks and to communicate effectively the risk and to update in a timely fashion what that risk is both to consumers, to animal handlers, to community members, et cetera.
So I think there’s a lot of work to do there and I am pretty happy it’s not my job to handle – (laughter) – but I think it’s a continued challenge and I applaud countries that are transparent about that to be able to prevent cross-border transmission.
Ms. Welsh: Thank you.
Mr. Murphy: So, very briefly, in my prepared remarks I say in the United States, when that sample goes to NVSL and it’s confirmed, that triggers response. So it’s a set program in the United States. The degree to which that is not implemented in other countries I don’t feel competent to talk about that. So –
Ms. Welsh: (Laughs.) Great. And anything else you’d like to add?
Mr. Murphy: Thank you for doing this. I think it’s a true One Health meeting. (Laughter.)
Ms. Welsh: It’s a huge compliment. Thank you.
Nidhi?
Ms. Bouri: I think what’s behind your question is really the concept of incentivization to report, right, and I think one of the things that we’ve seen continuously, whether it’s tabletop exercises or other forms, bringing different stakeholders to the table so the trade industry, different parts of governments, those who kind of handle supply chain, right – I mean, not just the animal and human health folks, we’ve seen to be really critical to surface and then get kind of some of the specific answers that are needed.
And the last thing I would say is, just going back to a comment I made at the beginning, FAO is probably one of the very few entities in the world who can work at the community level, the national level, and the global level and I really hope to see the United States continue to fully fund FAO in its critical work.
Ms. Welsh: Thank you, Nidhi.
Great place to turn it over to Thanawat.
Dr. Tiensin: Thank you. Thank you very much.
I think it’s easy question, but difficult to answer – (laughter) – because you know that when we’re talking about trade issues it’s always complex. But we know that when we share data or information of the situation of whatever, any disease – plan, pace, and so on – it really can help us to contain and control the situation quickly and we can have a rapid response. And that’s why building trust among trading partners is the key. And when we can manage to control the situation quickly, I’m sure that we can continue to trade and we can build safer trade among ourselves.
And that’s why at FAO our role is to support the countries to build capacities of phytosanitary and phytosanitaries at the country level, that we can help the countries, between the country in the regions or even international trade can continue, don’t have any impact after we have the situation. And that’s why all the tools today in terms of regionalization/compartmentalization will help us.
But, anyway, I am sure that when we talk we always find solution and especially between trading partners you also can figure out how we continue the trade without any barriers.
Thank you very much.
Ms. Welsh: This is a wonderful place to end the conversation today. So on behalf of CSIS and the U.N. FAO I would like to thank Stephanie Psaki, Thanawat Tiensin – thank you for joining us from Rome – Nidhi Bouri, Mike Murphy for coming in from – flying in from Minnesota for this event, and Dr. Erin Sorrell. Thank you so much for joining us today.
I want to thank the FAO for your strong partnership always and in particular for this event. So many people were involved in the success of today’s event including colleagues from Washington, Rome, and Bangkok, and also thanks to FAO colleagues around the world for doing the important work of ECTAD.
Thanks to my team, especially Anita Kirschenbaum, Isabella Gascon, Emma Dodd, Zane Swanson, and David Michel, and to the CSIS External Relations team. To our audience, thank you for joining us in person and online. Those of you who are with us, again, are welcome to join us for a reception on the second floor foyer. And this concludes our event. Thank you. (Applause.)

8,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/end-unrwa-then-what-gaza-human-toll,Unknown,"November 19, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS event hosted on November 19, 2024. Watch the full video here. Stephen Morrison: Good morning, good afternoon, good evening. I’m J. Stephen Morrison, senior vice president here at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., where I direct the CSIS global health work.
This is the 21st episode of our series here at CSIS Gaza: The Human Toll. Today’s episode is focused on “The End of UNRWA? Then What?”
This is a production of the CSIS Bipartisan Alliance for Global Health Security. We carry out this work in collaboration with our partners here at CSIS, with Jon Alterman, who’s with me here today, senior vice president and director of the CSIS Middle East Program; and Michelle Strucke, director of the CSIS Humanitarian Agenda and Human Rights Initiative. She can’t be with us today.
Purpose of this series is pretty simple; it’s to hear firsthand from experts in Gaza and the region who have accurate on-the-ground insights and knowledge as to what is happening in the unfolding health and humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Special thanks to my colleague Sophia Hirshfield, who coordinates this series; and to our production team, in particular Alex Brunner and Dwayne Gladden.
We’re joined today by two special guests, each of whom has kindly in the past appeared on earlier episodes.
We’ll be – we’ll be hearing momentarily and initially from Scott Anderson, who’s the deputy humanitarian coordinator and director of UNRWA affairs in Gaza. He’s served one way – in one form or another in the West Bank and in Gaza for 17 years. He’s a retired major in the U.S. Army, 21 years of service.
We’re also joined by Dahlia Scheindlin, political analyst and columnist at Haaretz, author of “The Crooked Timber of Democracy in Israel.” She is a public opinion researcher and political advisor who’s worked on eight national campaigns in Israel and in 15 other countries.
We’ll be hearing – we’ll be hearing momentarily from each of them. We’ve asked them to prepare some opening remarks, eight or 10 minutes of remarks, and then we’ll have – that’ll be followed by a conversation among them and Jon and myself. First, some brief framing remarks.
We started this series almost exactly one year ago, on November 13th, 2023, five weeks after the October 7 Hamas massacre of 1,200 in Israel and the seizure of 251 hostages. That triggered the subsequent invasion of Gaza by the Israeli military and the escalation – a cross-border escalation of violence involving Hezbollah and others.
The video and transcripts from this series are posted on the CSIS homepage, where you can find them.
Today, more than a year into the war, Gaza’s home to unspeakable suffering and trauma. One hundred hostages remain. Talks to bring about a ceasefire, release of hostages and prisoners/detainees, and a pathway to recovery have collapsed. There’s no defined end state to this war. Hamas continues cynically to use civilians as shields and infiltrate institutions and residential areas. It appears to maximize the suffering of the Palestinian population as a tactic of war. Israel continues to engage in widespread and often indiscriminate bombing and destruction of civilian areas; and systematically block access to water, medicine, power, and food. In most recent months, the health and humanitarian situation has reached a new nadir as access has deteriorated, flows of aid have become a trickle, fighting and forced evacuations have escalated.
Many of the numbers are quite familiar: 43,000 Gazans confirmed dead, a mix of armed militants and civilians; over 70 percent of that number women and children. Over 103,000 severely injured. Thousands missing in the rubble. Twenty-five thousand severely injured by bombardment now missing limbs and requiring lifelong care. An estimated 15,000 await medical evacuations. Dangers abound on many fronts – malnutrition and threat of famine, spread of infectious disease including polio, collapse of clean water and sanitation, disruption of schooling of 660,000 students.
There has been some modest positive news of late. The second round of polio campaign was completed November 5th – 94 percent coverage of under-10-year-old children. Some gaps, however, in the north – some serious gaps in the north in the areas of most intense fighting.
There have been some very important recent developments that have put a new light on this. The U.N. Independent Commission came out just recently and presented its findings to the U.N. General Assembly. The baseline conclusion the attacks – Israeli attacks on the health sector constitute a war crime. This has become a familiar refrain in U.N. circles.
The Famine Review Committee came out with its most recent review. Food supply across the territory has sharply deteriorated in areas of the northern Gaza Strip. We should assume starvation, malnutrition, excess mortality all rapidly increasing. Quote/unquote, “Famine thresholds have already been crossed or will be in the near future.”
Much attention here in Washington has been focused on the letter sent by Secretaries Blinken and Austin October 13th to their counterparts in the Israeli government enumerating 15 concrete areas where they were looking for progress and evidence of progress in a 30-day window to avoid scale back or conditionality on arms.
Right as that 30-day deadline approached a group of eight American aid groups – American and European aid groups issued a scorecard. So this was led by Refugees International and included Save the Children, Oxfam, the Norwegian Refugee Council.
They looked at 19 dimensions. They built on the 15 enumerated in the Austin-Blinken letter and concluded that in all but four of those 19 categories there had been no progress. They concluded Israel not only failed to meet the U.S. criteria that would indicate support to the humanitarian response but concurrently took actions that dramatically worsened the situation on the ground.
The Biden administration shortly thereafter did issue a decision that they would not withhold aid and that enough progress had been made at that – by the 30-day deadline. That drew quite a strong response in various places, in Washington and elsewhere.
So today what are we doing? We’re here to discuss UNRWA. The U.N. Relief and Works Agency created in 1949 care for three-quarters of a million refugees who fled Israel’s 1948 War of Independence.
Two laws were passed by the Knesset on October 28th that have created an existential crisis for UNRWA. One is – one ends the 1967 cooperation agreement that provided UNRWA with protection – rights of movement, mobility, and diplomatic immunity. So those have ended.
A second dimension was to end operations on Israeli territory in cooperation and contact with – in a 90-day timeline, which would put us into late January. These actions pose questions. Is UNRWA soon to have no choice but to cease operations in Gaza and the West Bank, and if so what will that mean and are there alternatives to that option and, if so, what?
UNRWA is the backbone today to the humanitarian response, care of displaced, provision of health, food, and education. One-third of the polio vaccinators came from UNRWA. One point nine million displaced persons are served with emergency shelter. One point six million receive health care. Other U.N. and international NGOs are dependent upon UNRWA for its logistical networks.
This action by the Knesset is part of a broader and escalating confrontation and tension between the Israeli government and the United Nations. In some respects, they’re playing chicken with one another, and they’re battling through the media, through campaigns – diplomatic campaigns, media campaigns – and on the ground. And in this process, neither is coming up with a concrete alternative to UNRWA at this moment in time.
The U.N. is responding with solidarity towards UNRWA, but it’s not coming up with operational alternatives. It’s pointing back to the Israeli government as having responsibility for that. The U.N. is really in a bind here in terms of thinking practically about what is possible. Authority rests with the U.N. General Assembly, the U.N. Security Council. So we have – we’re not seeing action in that front.
The Israeli government has had a special longstanding opposition to UNRWA, feeling that UNRWA’s existence perpetuates the refugee crisis over multiple generations. It’s raised objections to Hamas being embedded within its infrastructure. There’s a strong – as we’ll hear, there’s a strong domestic political consensus in support of this legislation. Prime Minister Netanyahu has final word on the implementation plan. The Israeli government is not taking responsibility for creating the operational new alternatives.
So where does this – we’re going to be talking today about where does this leave things. Is indeed UNRWA at a moment where it will soon have to cease operations? And we’re staring at the question, at a void as to what might happen. What will the – what will the consequences be? Are there – will we be creating a new catastrophe on top of this existing catastrophe?
The U.S. elections here undercut the leverage and credibility of the Biden administration, whatever it had prior to that point, the incoming Trump administration throwing its weight behind the Netanyahu government. We can assume, as of January 20th, as these actions come into force, the U.S. government will not have much political – as much political injury – energy – or bring the same level of intensity and resources to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
So we’re staring at a very difficult and complicated situation here. And we’ve asked Scott and Dahlia to offer their reflections on where we are, where this might lead, and if there are solutions that we could be thinking about.
So thank you. I’m going to start with Scott and ask you to lead things off. Thank you for taking time out of such a busy schedule to be with us again. Thank you, Scott.
Scott Anderson: Thank you and good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to join you today.
Indeed, UNRWA has been the one constant for Palestine refugees for 75 years, since the creation in 1949. Throughout many trials and tribulations that the refugee community has faced, UNRWA has been the one constant that has been there to provide lifesaving services for them.
This humanitarian crisis in Gaza is unparalleled. I first came to Gaza in 2008, so I’ve seen this, my fourth conflict here. And this one is unlike the other three, certainly. We’re now in 13 months of conflict. It’s devastated the infrastructure, where two thirds of buildings destroyed or damaged; decimated livelihoods. The vast bulk of the population is now unemployed. And it’s left the entirety of the population, half of whom are children, completely reliant on aid for their survival.
UNRWA has been the backbone of the humanitarian response throughout the crisis. We provide two thirds of all primary health care. We provide food to half the population, provide psychosocial support to over 700,000 people including over half a million children. But despite all those efforts, our resources are stretched quite thin and food security for the population remains very much a challenge.
The cost of this has been staggering. As you said, over 40,000 people have died. Within that, over 13,000 children were killed. Famine is booming according to the most recent IPC report. And 1.9 million people, or nearly the entire population, are displaced. Most of them have been displaced multiple times.
And unfortunately, Gaza has become a war of superlatives – most dangerous place to be a child, most dangerous place to be a humanitarian aid worker, and it’s the most dangerous place in the world for children to try to learn. And it’s more than just a humanitarian crisis. It’s a collapse of moral responsibility.
Now, should UNRWA be unable to continue when the laws go into effect – and I think it’s 67 days from today, which is January 28th – we already face critical funding gaps. Most countries that stopped funding early in the year have returned. We’ve been unable to import aid like many of the rest of the humanitarian community. And even before the bills went into effect, we faced challenges leading missions in the north, and we weren’t able to import our own cargo from Ashdod. It has to be consigned under another agency. In the West Bank – and I don’t have a lot of knowledge there – but I do know that our staff are not allowed to interact with Israeli authorities, but a lot of logistical coordination does happen through the World Food Programme.
Solo missions are basically not going to happen now for UNRWA. We have to do these within an interagency context. And we expect that as the progression to the bills taking effect goes forward, we will continue to see constraints put on us.
You know, to avoid the collapse of UNRWA and potentially the collapse of the humanitarian response in Gaza, what is needed is a freeze on the implementation of the bills. If there is to be a transition, then it needs to be well planned, well documented, and UNRWA should be – should be part of that. And lastly, funding needs to continue so we can continue the lifesaving interventions that we are doing in Gaza.
You know, Gaza logistically is probably the easiest response in the world. It’s 50 kilometers or so from Ashdod to Kerem Shalom. And inside Gaza, it’s 20 kilometers, give or take, along a very flat road. With the complete lack of law and order, those 20 kilometers inside Gaza become very daunting. And this is really no longer about logistics; it’s about political will, and ensuring that some sort of enabling environment exists for the humanitarian community to function inside Gaza, and to bring aid in at the correct scale needed to meet all the basic necessities of the – of the population.
But above all that, the thing that’s needed the most is a ceasefire. There’s over a hundred hostages still in Gaza that need to be reunited with their families. They’re probably living in conditions I cannot even begin to imagine. But for anything else to take place, first and foremost a ceasefire must happen and the hostages must go home.
Now, should Gaza collapse – and it’s – currently, if the bills are implemented as we understand, not only would UNRWA be unable to coordinate with Israel and with COGAT, but anybody coordinating on behalf of UNRWA would no longer be able to do that either. What that would create is for UNRWA an unacceptable security environment. International staff would no longer be in Gaza, and that would risk the collapse of the entire operation.
In addition to the services that we provide to the refugee community and to others affected by the conflict, we also provide services to the entire humanitarian community. We do all the fuel collection, storage, and distribution for all partners across Gaza, which includes some private sector like the banking and the limited telecommunications that do exist. And once the conflict does end, over 300,000 children will have nowhere to go to school. The 63 percent or 66 percent – two-thirds – of the primary health-care services would not be implemented. And when we talk about primary health care, we’re talking about things that could be lifesaving for people. We give insulin to diabetics, hypertension drugs to people with high blood pressure. Midwives look at pregnant women. And most importantly, if UNRWA goes away, people would look at something that they had lost, the refugee community.
And you know, WFP certainly could deliver food for 2 million people, but where would they be in terms of community acceptance? We rely on community acceptance as our means of security. If security goes away, then the entire U.N. could go away.
And UNRWA does play a role in the larger region, not only in Gaza and West Bank but we also operate in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan. Without UNRWA and the services we provide, it could lead to increased extremism as a generation grows without opportunities. You know, I listened to a brief today, and just to meet the growing population in Gaza there would need to be growth in the economy of 3 percent a year. That’s just to maintain current levels of unemployment. There’s a lot of work to do once this conflict ends.
You know, the challenge, I think, that we all face is UNRWA is unique within the United Nations in that we directly implement services. WHO doesn’t run clinics or hospitals; they advise governments how to run clinics and hospitals. UNICEF doesn’t run schools directly; they work through ministries of education to help train teachers, to help develop curriculum. And within their respective mandates they’re excellent, but this is far outside what they normally do.
Now, as we try to look forward and plan within the U.N., right now it’s very hard to plan for UNRWA past January, especially in Gaza and the West Bank. We are still focused on resilience. We’re still focused on the lifesaving interventions that we provide across the region. And we are now in a phase where four of our five fields are in very unstable environments or environments where conflict is ongoing.
Long-term sustainability in the region is going to require consistent political and financial support, not just for UNRWA but for everyone providing services to the community here. UNRWA is a stabilizing force for the region, and a lifeline for the refugees and for the community, and we remain the backbone of the operation in Gaza.
So I would close with saying that UNRWA’s role is really irreplaceable. There is no plan B besides the PA in a larger, I guess, political context that would need to move forward when we look at political solutions. But most importantly, above all this, as I said earlier, what’s needed is a ceasefire, for the hostages to return home to their families, and for people in Gaza to begin rebuilding their lives.
Well, thank you again for the opportunity to join the conversation, and I’ll end there.
Dr. Morrison: Thank you very much, Scott.
Over to you, Dahlia.
Dahlia Scheindlin: Hi. And thank you both for hosting me again.
I’m going to give a little bit of background to how this issue has evolved in Israel over time. And I think, you know, in order – well, in order to set the stage for what happened with this – with these laws and where we can expect them to go and what the Israeli government might have in mind after that, the first thing to remember is that this is not a new issue in Israel. Israel’s accusations against UNRWA go back years – years. I mean, I can’t put a start date on it, but they go far back and they are deeply political. The claims that Israel makes against UNRWA are entirely about UNRWA’s – what they perceive as UNRWA’s political role.
Primarily, you know, when Scott said that Israel accuses UNRWA of perpetuating the Palestinian situation, that’s really just a part of it. They do make that accusation on a logistical level by sustaining people in refugee camps, et cetera, but it’s more at the level – I think the deeper issue for Israel is that they believe that UNRWA has perpetuated the concept of right of return, teaches the concept of right of return, particularly to inside sovereign areas of Israel, which is something that is very controversial. And of course, there’s a U.N. resolution, 194, which provides for that right of return, and it – nevertheless, it’s never been accepted by Israel. And so they see UNRWA as kind of the conduit for teaching generations of Palestinians that they will be returning to sovereign Israel, which Israel sees as a threat to its existence. UNRWA is a linchpin in that campaign, from the Israeli perspective. So the – it’s part of – even the attacks against UNRWA over the years have been part of Israel’s longer-term campaign against the concept of Palestinian right of return. That is the real issue behind – that has been driving – the accusations against UNRWA for a long time.
Now, in addition to that, you have – you know, part of the argument is that UNRWA is a unique organization. It doesn’t fall under the other U.N. agency for the protection of refugees simply because it was created separately. But all of that is lost in the Israeli discourse. They claim it’s a unique organization because it fulfills what Israel sees as this unique role that is undermining Israel politically.
So the attacks go far back and they have been fleshed out by numerous actors. It’s not just one government and one particular minister. It’s not just right-wing governments. Just as an example, there’s a book that came out, must be about seven or eight – six or seven years ago now, called “The War of Return” – “The War of Return,” which sort of outlines all the reasons why right of return is not legitimate in the eyes of the Israeli authors, and UNRWA has a starring role in making the case for why right of return is unacceptable. So, again, these attacks go way back and they far preceded the war.
Now, what happened during the war, of course, is that the Israeli government found further ammunition by the evidence that certain employees of UNRWA were involved in the attacks, and so that became, you know, I think a major public issue which simply, you know, fed into this long-term – these long-term accusations.
I think that the reason why we know that these attacks were primarily political, however, over the years, and not really focused on the material problem of whether people were engaged or, you know – or whether there was overlap between Hamas or infiltration of Hamas, I mean, that would be considered an empirical problem – and I’m not, you know, taking a position on here – here on how extensive and how much of that there was, because I can’t claim to have the evidence – but the evidence that we have – that Israel’s – the threats were more political than they were based on those kinds of accusations is that all of those years, when UNRWA was at the heart of the Israeli accusations, the government didn’t take any action like it is now. In other words, for most of this time the Israeli government did not see the need to actually take action to dismantle UNRWA or prevent its activities, which makes it sound like, you know, in practice the Israeli government knew that UNRWA provided these critical services that nobody else was there to do.
Now, I think what happened is that during the war – I don’t think this was a plan that was in place, you know, on October 6th or even on October 7th. I think that quickly after the attacks of October 7th the – within, you know, some number of months, the Israeli government developed an opportunistic sense of, you know, that there was no limit to what they could do in Gaza politically, right? So, you know, the military campaign was ongoing, but it’s members of the government who have been openly stating their intention to change the political status of Gaza. And frankly, you know, what I mean is annexation. And how do I know this? Not because I made it up, but because they say it quite openly. At this point there have been, you know, numerous very, very public statements by certainly far-right settler leaders, but including ministers in the government.
I would date my observation of what the government intends to do and where UNRWA fits in back to January 2024. That’s when the Israeli minister of finance, Bezalel Smotrich – who is a key coalition member; he’s also got a ministerial position in the Defense Ministry that effectively advances annexation in the West Bank – he began making statements that the IDF should take over humanitarian aid in Gaza. But I think in January not too many people paid attention to it, but he said it very clearly that he wanted that to happen in order for there to be a basis for what was eventually going to be a military government that would be established. That’s a stepping stone towards the West Bank, right – the situation of the West Bank, which was the situation in Gaza prior to the Oslo Accords and the – and eventually the disengagement of 2005, which is that there would be reestablishment of a military government that is essentially an occupying – you know, an occupying force, theoretically conveyed as a temporary occupying force but which has become, we see in the West Bank, permanent over time. And so at the time I don’t think too many people took it seriously, but the fact is that that minister has been advocating this nonstop ever since. And what we’ve seen over the last roughly two months is that the idea has gained traction within the government.
And so I see that, you know, the actions against UNRWA fit into this. There has been – you know, I think much of the observation of the laws that were passed is that, you know, what is – what is the alternative going to be? Which other international organization does Israel expect to step in and do that? Speculation: Is it going to be the U.N. High Commissioner on Refugees? Is it going to be, you know, other U.N. agencies – the World Food Programme or World Health Organization? Who can – other international organizations? But I think that we’re missing the piece that, you know, again, senior figures of the Israeli government are saying quite openly, that it must be the IDF who takes over humanitarian aid. The reports that we’re getting over the last couple of months is that not only has the idea gained some traction within the government, but the prime minister has considered it; the Cabinet has approved, you know, that the IDF would begin looking into the possibilities of how that would be done, and even preparing to do so.
Now, it’s hard to know any more than that to what extent the IDF is actually making such plans. And the reason is that the IDF, when I’ve inquired about this, has said, no, that only the prime minister’s office is in charge of that kind of thing. So everybody’s trying to, you know, pass the information or pass the responsibility on to somebody else.
But what I will say is that the IDF does not want to do it. As far as we know, the security establishment in general has been, you know, quite publicly at odds with the political level over these long-term intentions. The IDF, for professional and security reasons, does not think it’s a good idea for Israel to permanently occupy Gaza and, you know, annex and rebuild Jewish settlements. And you know, it’s the army that would be the first step towards that process, and they are not happy about that role. So we know that there is somewhat of a disagreement. We don’t know how extensive it is or if – even if the plans are seeing this.
And I want to just say one more thing about to what extent we expect this to be implemented. I mean, the law is pretty clear. I think at first even I thought that the law was a little bit more show than – you know, than reality because it was – it specifically stated that UNRWA wouldn’t be able to operate in sovereign areas, which, you know, I felt at first to be amorphous about that kind of thing. But you know, Israel does not even consider itself formally sovereign over the West Bank and Gaza. However, I think that the structure of UNRWA and how it operates and what Scott’s explained to us and the level of communication that it needs with Israeli authorities makes that not a particularly relevant limitation.
The other thing that the law includes is after the 90-day period it stipulates that there is a mechanism within the National Security Council who has to actively report on how well the law is being implemented. So, I mean, Israel has a history of passing laws that are a little bit more for show than reality, but I think the fact that that – it includes that mechanism signifies a level of intent to actually implement it. I don’t expect the law to be frozen at – you know, in the past we had, for example, the law on regularization of settlements that even Israel considers to be illegal that was passed in 2017. The attorney general did freeze the implementation and eventually it was overturned by the Supreme Court. I don’t see that happening in this case. I haven’t heard of any appeals. I haven’t found any. I was trying to find out if there are but I think it would have been clear by now. I have not heard of petitions being submitted to the high court against this and anything from the attorney general indicating that that might be a possibility.
It’s also worth remembering the attorney general right now is under a severe, unrelenting attack from the government over other issues. They want to dismiss her. It’s very unlikely for the reasons that I mentioned before about the longer-term accusations against UNRWA, that the attorney general would make this some sort of a pause, you know, given the sensitivity of her position right now.
And so, you know, it’s hard to predict that this will – you know, I was asked to answer is this the end of UNRWA. I can’t really predict that but I do think that we need to see it in the context of the Israeli government’s political aims, going forward, and resting on the case that it’s built within practically a consensus in Israeli society against UNRWA, going back years before.
Dr. Morrison: Thank you.
Scott, before we turn to Jon, any thoughts on what we just heard from Dahlia?
Mr. Anderson: Right. Maybe just one or maybe just a couple of things.
You know, first, for over 20 years UNRWA has given our entire staff list to the government of Israel. It’s a long-standing requirement and we’ve done that and – I mean, I don’t know what was done with it but we never heard much back is all I will say.
Second, you did talk about the right of return and this is not something UNRWA uniquely teaches. We teach the curriculum that the Palestinian Authority develops. If UNRWA stops teaching that will not stop that teaching.
And just, lastly, to say the right of return was enacted a year before UNRWA was created. They are not in any way linked. Similarly, the refugee status of people is not linked to UNRWA’s existence either. It’s much different and I think that some of that is often lost in the larger discussion around UNRWA and the role that we play within the services we provide to the community and that we do keep certain things alive.
I think it’s a bit overstated but that’s just my opinion. Thank you.
Dr. Morrison: And, Dahlia, I did hear that the AG is doing a review and I also heard that the prime minister has the right to approve or – approve the implementation plan or modify it. In other words, there’s at least those two possibilities in which there could be reconsideration of the pace and focus and actual, you know, concrete details of the implementation.
So that – I see those two things as important.
Ms. Scheindlin: What I was trying to say about various controversial laws in Israel is that we’ve had, you know, unfortunately, a deterioration of the quality of the legislative process over recent years and a lot of times there’s legislation that’s passed, you know, primarily for the – frankly, the domestic publicity element.
And so we’ve seen in some cases that they’re not implemented with any – you know, with – in serious ways, or they can definitely be – there can be a sort of political decision, more or less formal, mostly less formal – just don’t need to do very much with them. And I think one example is the nation-state law, which is a basic law that was passed in 2018 that essentially creates a higher – constitutionally defined a higher status for the Jewish population and everybody else is of a sort of lower status. But – and it even stipulates in a few areas, for example, that it formally kind of demotes the Arabic language. So this was a huge controversy with protests – justifiably so – because it is a formal, you know, two-tiered status within Israeli society right now. However, there’s not much that’s been done that actually implements it. It hasn’t been used very often in court cases, for example, to try to back policies of inequality.
It’s just – I mean, I don’t want to diminish it because I think it’s a real stain on Israel’s constitutional makeup such as it is, given that they don’t have a formal constitution. But I’m giving that as an example for the fact that if there is – you know, if the prime minister does decide that this is not in Israel’s interest to actually, you know, go forward with this at the pace or at the level to the extent that it possibly could it’s a possibility that this won’t be implemented in a serious way.
And I think in – you know, if it had been passed not in the context of the current war, I probably would have said this is the kind of legislation of that type that’s being used more as part of, you know, the populist kind of signaling and outbidding among far-right-wing communities in Israel, which – again, we’ve seen then with many kinds of laws that are being – or, bills that are being discussed right now. There’s, you know, numerous other examples.
You know, just to give you a few, there are bills being discussed that would ban certain kinds of Arab parties from running for Knesset or for deporting Arab citizens – that one has actually been passed if they’re found to be connected to terror but in very, very broad and undefined ways – all sorts of things that we don’t know if they will actually be implemented, and probably not. But some of them are being legislated. Some of them will never go into law. And some of them are – have passed into law and are still not implemented in significant ways. If this was passed before and not in the context of the current war, I probably would have said it was one of those.
I think, to my mind, the political framework that changed everything is these open statements coming from senior figures in the Israeli government who are advocating annexation and rebuilding settlements, coupled with what we’ve seen north of Gaza, which is, you know, vast damage that involves essentially clearing the area of as many citizens as – civilians as possible and destroying the infrastructure so thoroughly that it’s like laying the groundwork for a first stage of annexation.
So between these open statements, many of them heated statements from senior Israeli government figures, and the actions we see on the ground, I think that I’m – you know, if we have to guess, and it is speculation, how this law or might not be implemented, I think this raises the possibility that it will be implemented in more serious ways. But it also depends on how long the war goes on.
And that certainly speaks to Scott’s point about, you know, if there is a ceasefire, then the opportunism, that that opportunity that the far right sees for advancing plans like establishing a military government in Gaza, maybe beginning with IDF taking over humanitarian aid, there’s not that much of an opportunity to do that. Those things take time to plan. If there is no ceasefire any time soon, if the war drags on, I see already how much, you know, progress has been made with what seemed like an unthinkable idea back in January 2024. And it’s already, you know, reaching much higher levels and being taken much more seriously. So I think it really does depend on whether the war ends or not.
Dr. Morrison: Thank you.
Jon.
Jon. B Alterman: First, to set a little bit of context, Israel is still a traumatized society after October 7th. If you think back to the United States after 9/11, we went into Iraq 18 months after 9/11 and the country was still, I think, very much seized with the events. Dahlia can speak with much more granularity than I can, but my sense is that Israelis still feel profoundly vulnerable, profoundly injured.
I think, because of that, there is this deep sense that I’ve perceived when I’ve read the Israeli press – and I think Dahlia would probably agree – that there’s a way in which UNRWA is providing aid and comfort to the enemy and that the act – what I think a lot of people outside see as necessary humanitarian assistance to civilians is seen by many Israelis – not all, but many Israelis – as aid and comfort to the enemy, and therefore, by its nature, illegitimate.
There is also a deeper skepticism or hostility to the United Nations and the U.N. system that dates back decades. It didn’t start with the Zionism Is Racism resolution in the General Assembly in the 1970s, Yasser Arafat addressing the General Assembly long before he professed to give up terrorism. But there really is, I think, a – and the ineffectuality in the eyes of many Israelis of the UNIFIL operation in southern Lebanon.
There is this sense – it’s not just UNRWA. I think there is a sense that the U.N. system is biased against Israel, that the U.N. General Assembly has passed any number of resolutions against Israel, to no effect. And the U.S. keeps protecting Israel in the Security Council. And therefore the U.N. system is something that Israelis don’t feel comfortable with, and UNRWA’s existence is sort of added to that.
The other piece of this is the incoming Trump administration. Of course, the last time around, the Trump administration cut U.S. funding to UNRWA more than $200 million a year. It is hard for me to imagine that the Trump administration, when it comes in, will not once again cut funding for UNRWA, let alone protect UNRWA –
Dr. Morrison: In any way.
Dr. Alterman: – in any way. Elise Stefanik, in many ways, became U.N. ambassador because she attacked U.S. university presidents for not being more aggressive about anti-Israeli protests on campus. So I can’t imagine that when the administration takes office that its goal will not be to reorient U.S. policy to be much more supportive or permissive of Israel. My guess is actually more permissive than supportive.
And then the question – and it’s a question really for Dahlia – is the extent to which the Biden administration has been a constraint on Israeli policy, because Netanyahu can say I have to keep the Americans on side. What happens to those right-wing ministers who have been advocating for annexation, expulsion, all those kinds of things? If the U.S. government is no longer holding back the prime minister, does that change Netanyahu’s calculus for how to – where he wants to strike the balance where the Israeli public is in terms of annexation, expulsion, the kinds of things that some of the ministers have talked about and that Netanyahu has always been reluctant to embrace up to now.
Dr. Morrison: Dahlia, any thoughts?
Ms. Scheindlin: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, just to go back to one – an earlier point that you made about how Israelis perceive the U.N. system, yes, this has been a very, very longstanding relationship. Skepticism would be putting it mildly. Israelis frankly have believed that the entire international system is somehow built and exists in order to condemn and criticize Israel.
I have to say that is an axiomatic view. And it spans most institutions. In other words, I can tell you from a survey I conducted, together with my Palestinian colleague Khalil Shikaki, back in July, we asked about whether Israelis believe international – that the ICJ and ICC and broadly international institutions are biased against Israel. And we had a consensus among Israeli Jews; I mean, over – well over 75 percent.
Among Palestinians we asked a similar question, whether international institutions are ultimately influenced by the U.S. in favor of Israel, and a very similar number believed that they are. So we have a mirror image of skepticism, and I think that does raise the question of serious failures of the international community, on the one hand, to make, you know, the different sides of the conflict feel it’s able to protect them.
I think a lot of this is simply – there’s no good way to put it. A lot of it has been exaggeration and factual inaccuracy over the years. And some of the reasons why there is more attention to Israel, which there is, is partly because the conflict has gone on longer than most other conflicts. It goes back to, you know, 1948, if not before the beginning of the U.N. system.
And there are lots of reasons why Israelis have taken, you know, areas where the international institutions are – do seem focused on Israel and interpreted them as if they’re anti-Israel. In many ways Israel has been able to conduct policies that violate international law for decades without the kind of sanctions that they would be – that other countries have received, partly because it’s, of course, backed by the U.S.
So that’s, you know, a longstanding point of controversy between how the Israeli public sees the international system. But you were accurate to describe it like that, right? They do see it as stacked against them.
In terms of whether the Trump administration will change its policy and thereby change Netanyahu’s calculus, I would probably take issue with the idea that the Biden administration seriously constrained the Israeli government. For most of this time, the Biden administration was, you know, essentially using its power to make some requests, right, asking Israel to constrain itself in certain areas. And Israel made adjustments to its policy as a result, maybe delaying, you know, let’s say, going into Rafah for a time, but ultimately did exactly what the U.S. asked it not to do for most of this time, whether it was going into Rafah or the escalations on the regional level, and also by – you know, by being one of the parties that has been an obstacle to a ceasefire up until now, not to take away from the responsibility of Hamas for that either.
And whether Trump will give Israel more of a free hand, it certainly looks like it. We didn’t know when he was – given the team that he’s been putting into place, it does look like he plans to give Israel much more of a free hand in general. And that’s – they were – you know, you could say, well, Netanyahu doesn’t plan to move ahead faster, you know, accelerate the pace and, you know, become more decisive about these long-term political games, which I see in the government’s own statements – not everybody would agree with me, by the way, but I think that – I take them at their word.
That’s all very hard to say, considering that, you know, two things – even if this government does last to the end of its term, that’s two years away. Two years is a long time, but it might not be long enough to implement this kind of thing.
And then, you know, when you asked about the Israeli public, this is a thornier question, because the truth is that survey research does not support some sort of consensus within Israel for annexing Gaza. There has been a surprising level of support from Israeli Jews for rebuilding settlements, but when I say surprising, I mean between 40 and 50 percent. And the higher rate of support was earlier in the war. Most extreme attitudes that I saw in the early phase of the war had declined somewhat in the later stages.
We also see that, you know, there’s still not – you know, there never really was majority support for annexation in the West Bank in general in Israel, including in 2020 when it was much more of a realistic possibility. And so Israel is not entirely behind that kind of a plan, and I have a feeling that the more it becomes a realistic possibility – if the government really does move forward and start talking about – you know, more seriously about the IDF turning into the reestablishment of a military government – Israelis have a collective memory of what that meant. The military government over Gaza was one of the reasons why Israel left Gaza. It was a serious liability. It’s very costly. And I – you know, I’m not sure if the public would really be behind it.
And of course, I really have to limit that observation in general to the Jewish public because the Palestinian citizens of Israel are dead set against all of this, right? So we’re talking about completely different attitudes among the two populations within Israeli citizens.
Having said all of this, this is a government that has practiced in the art of ignoring the will of the majority of Israelis. It was practicing that skill throughout 2023, when it faced down mass demonstrations and numerous surveys showing that a majority consistently opposed its plans to undermine the Israeli judiciary. And we see a similar – you know, a similar dynamic at play over the course of this year, where we’ve had a majority in all surveys who would have preferred a hostage release deal in return for a ceasefire. Consistently a majority of the entire population, right, of all people who were surveyed, which is Jewish and Arab citizens alike, were a plurality depending on what the tradeoffs were, and the government has managed to ignore that as well, even at the cost of losing those hostages, you know, practically, month by month, week by week, even day by day.
And so a lot of this – I can’t – you know, I really can’t predict all the different pathways this might play out, but I will say that the ministers of this government are certainly playing the long game. And I think it’s too early to say whether they’ll actually be able to implement that kind of a plan.
Dr. Morrison: Thank you.
Scott, you know, we’ve seen a lot of action taken in the Security Council lately – briefings, motions, unanimous decisions. We’ve seen a lot of expressions of solidarity. The threat of action against UNRWA has tended to be lumped, you know, or referred to the ICC or the ICJ, and it’s been seen as, you know, further accumulation of evidence to be used in some, you know, prosecutorial context. But I see no planning for actual operational entities that would avoid a crash in late January or early February. That reality, that the humanitarian mission may collapse, is in tension with this – is in tension with this solidarity mission of standing by UNRWA in this period. What can be done, in your view, to avoid a crash in 60 days?
Mr. Anderson: I think, first, you know, for the sake of the argument, let’s say that UNRWA is going to no longer operate in Gaza. Sixty days is impossible to turn over the operation. There’s simply no way to do it. A U.N. mission, MINUSMA, shut down recently. They had six months, and they still didn’t quite do it. And that was shutting down, but it wasn’t handing over thoughtfully operations that are providing a lifesaving intervention to people.
Now, we talked about the two-thirds primary health care. I talked about the insulin. What that translates to is 16,000 primary medical care visits a day. That’s 16,000 people every day that come into our health center health points and they get treatment. You know, how do you hand that over?
You know, one of the things that’s come out of the challenges we’ve faced this year is a report that the French foreign minister – former foreign minister, Colonna, put together with recommendations about staff vetting, all these things. You know, absent some staff vetting, how eager is anyone going to be to take on UNRWA staff, right? I mean, Israel has said a lot about them, and I think it’s in the public sphere, and it really sunk in for, you know, some people. So this is – this is very complicated.
And 60 days or, what, I think 67 is what I said earlier, is where we’re at now. It’s not possible turning this over. And it would take, as I said earlier, a lot of time and thoughtful deliberation. The only thing that’s going to allow this to happen is time, and time is what’s going to be needed to try to figure out how to create the best environment for the civilians in Gaza.
You know, and I think something that Dahlia said earlier kind of struck me when she talked about UNRWA cannot operate in sovereign Israel. The only way I can get to Gaza is to go through sovereign Israel; there is no other path right now, right? So we can’t be coordinated in, so it becomes very problematic. You know, and it, I guess, then speaks to can our local staff continue to operate.
So part of the challenge with figuring out a plan is we don’t know, as I think was said earlier, how will this be implemented. What are the constraints that will be put in place? What is the intention for the government of Israel? What is the intention that will be passed to COGAT in terms of how to move this forward? You know, when I talk to people in COGAT, they have said they will implement the law as it’s written. So I think, you know, what you said earlier, Dahlia, is correct, that this isn’t one for domestic show; this will have some beef to it. And absent kind of all that and a, really, conversation at a higher level than mine, it’s very difficult to figure out what we’re going to do next, and what would happen if UNRWA can no longer operate, and how we ensure services are still provided to the community.
So I think that we need to answer a lot of questions. It’s made much more difficult because there is no high-level engagement, certainly, between UNRWA leadership and the government of Israel at the moment, but also there’s not a lot at the higher levels of the U.N. itself outside of those of us that are operating inside Gaza.
Dr. Morrison: I mean, it seems to me that UNRWA is staring at two things. It’s staring at a crash of its capabilities in Gaza and West Bank with no plan in place for dealing with that, so a really bad situation goes into an accelerated decline, and it’s very visible, and it’s in both the West Bank and in Gaza but particularly in Gaza, where things are already in horrible shape. It goes into something beyond horrible to apocalyptic or however you think about it. The other is you have to figure out a way to sustain and survive for the next several years in your other operations. So you’ve got to rally your donors, you’ve got to be protecting your Lebanon and Jordan and Syria operations so that they do not somehow also stumble in this period.
Mr. Anderson: Yeah, that’s correct. I mean, we do – as I said, we provide services across five fields, and it’s complicated. It’s a very complex political environment in every field in which we operate. You know, and the world I would use in Gaza that most likely would occur is not apocalyptic; it’s famine, all right? We’re on the edge of that now, I think. And it’s been reported by – through the IPC, as well as WFP and others, that there are likely pockets of famine in the north now. If, you know, an agency or an entity that’s over half or at half of the entire response no longer operates, we’re very much headed toward famine, if not famine-like conditions across all of Gaza. And it’s exacerbated further by the fact that as an entire international humanitarian community at the moment we are unable to bring aid in at the scale needed, and it’s due to the lack of law and order environment particularly in
Rafah.
So I think that, you know, there’s political challenges to this. There are operational challenges to this. But the biggest takeaway, as I said earlier, is there is no way to solve all this and put a plan in place between now and January 28. It’s just simply – it’s simply not possible. And unfortunately, the people in Gaza, half of whom are children, are the ones that will bear the brunt of that decision. And if UNRWA can no longer operate, they would bear the brunt of the impact.
Dr. Morrison: But there is no active dialogue between the Israeli and U.N. leadership on trying to avoid the worst outcome. Is that correct?
Mr. Anderson: Not to my knowledge is all I can say.
Dr. Morrison: It’s a standoff.
Mr. Anderson: But I’m at a – I’m at – not at the higher levels of U.N. leadership. I have enough to do inside Gaza than to worry about everything else.
Dr. Morrison: (Laughs.)
Mr. Anderson: But to my knowledge, there are not any discussions happening. And I guess that’s all I can say on it.
Dr. Morrison: Right. And within the Israeli government, we have the tensions that Dahlia outlined. There’s political impulses towards annexation and making use of the IDF, but the IDF is not onboard at all on that notion of becoming – taking operational responsibilities.
Ms. Scheindlin: I mean, I just want to – you know, listen, I don’t want to overstate the case. I mean, the IDF is also very sensitive – it’s being put in a position similar to that of the attorney general. The government has been attacking the security establishment as well, mainly to deflect its own responsibility for having failed to detect and prevent and cope with October 7th. And so the prime minister has –
Mr. Anderson: It dismissed the defense minister.
Dr. Morrison: Right. Gallant.
Mr. Anderson: And dismissed the defense minister just a few weeks ago.
Ms. Scheindlin: Well, yes, of course. I mean, I would put that as somewhat part of this campaign and somewhat part of their personal bad blood going back to the prewar phase in 2023, because the defense minister was always a bit of a political black swan, you know, in the Likud Party of the prime minister. So they have personal tensions going back. He wasn’t considered sufficiently loyalist and sufficiently populist, and he brought professional and military concerns to the judicial overhaul plan of the government. He tried to pause it, not even stop it. He was almost fired a first time. And so I think Netanyahu – how should I put it? – had been waiting for that moment for a long time. But, yes, it definitely illustrates the kinds of tensions that we’re talking about between professional considerations of security matters versus political considerations of the government.
And so given those sensitivities the government has been trying to blame the security establishment as well as the legal establishment, by the way, for – which may be a little bit hard to explain in the little time we have left – and the – I would say the senior figures in the army and in, you know, the intelligence services are very sensitive about not wanting to appear to do anything as if they’re – you know, not as if they are opposing the policies of the government.
And so we know this from kind of, you know, rumors and leaks and, you know, people enough on the inside to kind of know how these things are seen from the inside of these tensions. But I think that the – you know, the army and the military will be very, very cautious about doing anything that would be seen to go against the government.
So if they were directly ordered to set up, you know, for example, that very first step of taking over humanitarian aid in Gaza I can’t see anybody in the military establishment actually saying, you know what, we can’t do this. I mean, it wouldn’t come to that. That would look like a military coup and it would very quickly be accused of being a military coup. Moreover, I think the Israeli government is building the case to say exactly for the reason – I mean, it really plays very cleverly on what Scott said. Not to sound totally conspiratory, but I think there’s a fine line between, you know, strategy and conspiracy.
If the strategy is that the IDF takes over humanitarian aid they’re going to be saying exactly what Scott said. There’s nobody else to do it right now. There’s no plan in place. We all agree that there has to be some humanitarian support for the civilians in Gaza. We’re already there. We can do it better and more efficiently. They are already making those arguments. So I wouldn’t necessarily expect that the IDF is going to somehow put up, you know, serious policy opposition to this even if they might not like it, even if they may be, you know, posing it sort of in the preliminary stages.
Dr. Morrison: We’ve got just a few more minutes to wrap up here and this has been pretty revealing in terms of just how formidable these challenges really are. I guess I would like to ask you all, including Jon, to speak to, like, what’s the message to deliver to a Washington audience today.
The Biden administration has sort of gotten to the end of the line, it seems, in its activism on these issues. It basically folded its tent or threw in the towel last week. The Trump team is busy putting the pieces together for its new cabinet – new government – and absorbed with that.
There’s a 60-day window here before we get to the inauguration and we get to the – soon thereafter this moment of reckoning that’s been put down in the – through the legislation.
So what is – what would – let’s start with Scott and Dahlia and close with Jon. What’s your advice? What are the messages you want to leave with a Washington audience now? This is a very dangerous situation.
Mr. Anderson: To me, the most important thing and the reason I’m here in Gaza is to prevent a further humanitarian catastrophe. That’s what we’re focused on. We’re focused on delivering life-saving interventions and helping people.
As I said, I think it’s impossible to – if UNRWA can no longer operate for us to have something in place that would replace us by January 28 and what’s needed most importantly is time. We need to figure out a proper planning timeline and figure out the best way that we could do this.
It would be to pause implementation and have a proper discussion with UNRWA to make sure we’re part of the conversation, that things are handed over in such a way if it would happen that it doesn’t negatively impact the civilian population inside Gaza, and until then UNRWA still has operations ongoing in Gaza as well as across the region. Funding needs to continue.
Thank you.
Dr. Morrison: Thank you.
Dahlia?
Ms. Scheindlin: I don’t think I have an easy message but I will say, you know, believe the Israeli government. Listen to what they say. I think that it’s – there’s sort of a denial sometimes that they really mean it and I think that there’s no other choice.
I agree with what Scott said earlier in this conversation. Nothing will really guarantee the humanitarian, you know, improvement in the lives of Gazans anything beyond, you know, tomorrow except for a ceasefire.
There’s no way to have – you know, to even consider reconstructing the vast destruction of that, the desperately destroyed civilian infrastructure in Gaza, until there’s a ceasefire. And a ceasefire can’t be a piecemeal policy of, you know, a 10-day or a two-month or a temporary ceasefire.
It has to be part of a comprehensive political resolution to the conflict which has been delayed for decades, which sounds probably very remote in the context of this conversation because there’s such urgent and immediate desperately needed solutions to the humanitarian crisis.
But we don’t want to see a recurrence of this year after year. There’s no other way. I don’t need to remind Scott, certainly, but maybe the audience needs to be reminded that Gaza was in a desperate situation before this war. You talked about the unemployment rate. Gaza had 45 percent unemployment before the war.
Now it’s, I think, you know, 90 percent. And that’s not a – I mean – these are the cycles that led to where we are now. I think, you know, there’s – again, there’s no way to really get at these issues without both a ceasefire that then leads to longer-term comprehensive political resolution to the conflict.
Dr. Morrison: Thank you.
Jon?
Dr. Alterman: There’s a tendency to see this as a microcosm. I think it’s important to see it in the broader context. The Trump administration is going to come in with profound skepticism toward the U.N. and U.N. agencies, profound skepticism about the utility of international organizations to advance shared goals; I think much less interest in a whole range of humanitarian priorities that others have had.
It seems to me that you might be able to talk about this as an example but to me it’s important that we also put it in the context of a much broader set of consequences if the U.S. turns away from international organizations providing that sort of humanitarian relief.
The United States provides huge amounts of support, as you know, to people suffering all over the world, often through the U.N., and it seems to me that all of those efforts are imperiled and if people are serious about that I think we have to look at the broader issue and not just at the issue of Gaza or not just at the issue of UNRWA.
Dr. Morrison: That’s a great point. I also think that we’re going to see much tighter humanitarian budgets as we get into this period. I mean, when the decision was taken by the first Trump administration in 2018 to end support for UNRWA there were workarounds through UNHCR and through ICRC funding.
The budgets were much fuller at that time and that allowed a strategy to soften the blows and the Trump administration did some of that. It’s going to be more difficult, I think, in this next phase.
I want to thank you both, Dahlia Scheindlin and Scott Anderson. Thank you for making the time in your crazy schedules to be here with us today and to be so candid and honest about all of this, and thank you for your leadership and commitments on these matters. And thanks to Jon for being a partner in this enterprise; and to our colleagues here – Sophia Hirshfield, Dwayne Gladden, and Alex Brunner – for making this all possible.
You can find this video and transcript later today on the CSIS homepage, CSIS.org. And we will be back in touch soon with our next episode. Thank you.

9,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/civil-society-and-environmental-politics-middle-east-and-north-africa,Unknown,"November 15, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS event hosted on November 13, 2024. Watch the full video here. Will Todman: Good morning, good afternoon, and welcome to CSIS. I’m Will Todman, the deputy director and a senior fellow in the Middle East Program here. I am really delighted to welcome you to a discussion about environmental politics and civil society in the Middle East and North Africa. 
I am joined by three wonderful colleagues with a real wealth of expertise on this topic. Firstly, joining me is Amy Hawthorne. She is an independent consultant on the Middle East with expertise on democracy and reform in the region. She was previously the deputy director of the Project on Middle East Democracy, has held positions within several think tanks, and served in the U.S. State Department during and in the aftermath of the Arab Spring. Next, we have Hajar Khamlichi, who is a sustainability expert and a climate activist from Morocco. She is joining us from Baku, Azerbaijan, where she is attending the COP conference. She has been involved in and founded a number of environmental initiatives in the region. She has served as the co-founder of the Mediterranean Youth Climate Network, the Imal Initiative of Climate and Development, and she's also the co-founder of the Tangier Observatory for the Protection of the Environment. Joining me here in the studio is Aly Rahim, who is the program manager of the Global Partnership for Social Accountability (GPSA) and also the Global Lead for Citizen Engagement at the World Bank. He was previously an assistant to the president of the World Bank, where his portfolio included civil society and stakeholder engagement. 
The discussion today marks the release of my new report, “Mobilizing for Sustainability: Environmental Civil Society in the Middle East and North Africa.” In this report, I sought to understand the degree to which civil society can drive environmental action in different parts of the Middle East and North Africa. I chose a range of case studies. I studied the cases of Iraq, Oman and Tunisia. My colleague and co-author, Martin Pimentel studied Morocco. We wanted to understand how and in what ways civil society can contribute to efforts to tackle environmental and climate crises that are facing the region today. To those of you watching online, you can submit questions using either the button on our website or on YouTube. So please do that, and I will raise them for the panelists. 
Firstly, Hajar, I'd love it if you could help us set the scene. What are the greatest environmental challenges that civil society actors in the region are trying to tackle today. Why is this topic important?
Hajar Khamlichi: The region is facing a wide array of environmental challenges, which are further intensified by climate change. One major issue is water scarcity, as the region is among the most water-stressed areas globally. Factors like rapid population growth, inefficient agricultural practices, and worsening climate change exacerbate these shortages, affecting health, human security, and the economy. Countries like Jordan, Tunisia, Morocco, and Yemen are particularly vulnerable, as the strain on water resources has far-reaching implications for regional stability.
Another relevant topic for the region is desertification and land degradation, caused by expanding desert lands, overgrazing, and unsustainable farming practices. This impacts food security, livelihoods, and economic resilience, as nations rely on agricultural productivity to sustain both the local region and the broader economy.
Air pollution is also a serious issue, particularly in rapidly urbanizing areas with growing fossil fuel dependency. Major cities like Cairo, Tehran, and Riyadh face significant public health risks due to pollution. Marine and coastal degradation, especially in countries like Morocco, Egypt, and Tunisia, poses another challenge, with overfishing and biodiversity loss impacting local economies and natural resources.
Waste management is a priority for civil society, as poor practices are visibly affecting both rural and urban areas. Inadequate disposal and recycling contribute to soil and water contamination, endangering public health. Deforestation, though less prominent, is a significant issue, especially in Morocco, Lebanon, and Algeria, where urban development leads to erosion, biodiversity loss, and reduced carbon sequestration capacity.
Finally, the transition to clean energy and emissions reduction is a considerable challenge. While civil societies are eager to address this, they often lack the necessary resources. These challenges underscore the urgent need for sustainable policies and comprehensive strategies that integrate environmental, economic, and social dimensions to build resilience for the long term.
Mr. Todman: That's a daunting list of challenges that you laid out for us. You mentioned a couple of areas that civil society actors are more involved in, waste management in particular. Can you give us a bit of optimism? What are some of the most promising initiatives that you've seen different civil society actors working on in the region?
Ms. Khamlichi: Civil society in the region is actively focused on water resource management. Initially, their efforts centered on raising awareness, which is often the starting point for civil society actors in the region. They then moved toward advocacy, and today, they’re implementing innovative projects for water conservation. For example, in Morocco, the Observatory for the Protection of the Environment and Historical Monuments leads community-driven initiatives in rainwater harvesting and water-saving practices. In Jordan and Palestine, local policy advocacy and gray water recycling projects demonstrate civil society’s essential role in resource management.
Waste management has also been a significant theme in Morocco and Tunisia, where grassroots organizations raise awareness and organize waste collection campaigns. However, policy has often lagged behind the advocacy efforts, creating an imbalance. Progress in this area is more advanced in Morocco and Jordan than in other countries.
Renewable energy advocacy is another major issue. Tunisian grassroots groups, especially in the south where fossil fuel reserves are concentrated, have been particularly effective, moving from local action to national policy influence. In Jordan, photovoltaic (PV) solar rooftops are already part of national policy, with civil society focusing on the water-energy nexus. Morocco has recently introduced policies with more specific regulations, promoting a multi-level approach where groups work locally, sub nationally, and nationally, complementing the efforts of companies and advocacy groups. This shift represents a significant step forward in organizing long-standing efforts into effective networks.
Mr. Todman: Thank you. I do want to come back to that point later, about the level at which we can hope that civil society groups have the most impact. It's perhaps helpful to clarify who we're talking about as well. At this stage, when we talk about civil society, it's a really diverse community, including formal NGOs, informal activists, and volunteers. There are also journalists who are working to raise environmental awareness, entrepreneurs who are trying to come up with new green solutions, and even artists who are trying to get involved in efforts to spread environmental awareness. Aly, if I can come to you next, Hajar has mentioned how competitive civil society is in a variety of areas. She talked about project management as being one of the most successful ways in which civil society is focusing their efforts today. How can international actors best amplify some of these local initiatives? This includes your perspective from working in the World Bank. How do you think about getting involved in supporting this kind of work? 
Aly Rahim: Thanks for having me here. Your report is quite timely with the eve of COP in Baku, and there are serious discussions that have been happening over the last year about the renewal of the international financial architecture and reaching our goals for climate finance in the developing world. There is the 100-billion-dollar pledge from Paris, which we were involved in when that number was being developed. It is important to question what that promise means and who we are delivering it through.
A lot of the thinking about the renewal of the international public financial architecture has been about how we 1) catalyze larger flows of public dollars, and 2) governments. Particularly, how we leverage those scarce funds, whether they're concessional funds, grant money, or other kinds of financing instruments, to catalyze larger amounts of capital flow. Bilateral donors, philanthropies, and others who support the civil society ecosystems are thinking about this, but we're not yet strategically leveraging the idea of what civil society brings to these large global challenges.
There's a rethinking underway. Your report is another salvo for that. We've been thinking seriously about this over the last two years. The Global Partnership for Social Accountability (GPSA), which I led, quite appropriately emerged in the wake of the Arab Spring. The president of the World Bank at the time, Bob Selig, saw what was happening in the Middle East, said that we can't just work through governments and the private sector alone to reach our development goals. We need to build architecture to engage civil society.
We've done good things on this platform, but it did not scale, and often it doesn't scale. The challenge as we look forward to the future is, how do we take this bridge ecosystem of work—which you described in your report, and which Hajar is getting to in her comments—and link it to large-scale finance? This is where we fail to integrate, and we have this fragmented development ecosystem. How we think of development in the multilateral space is very different from how philanthropies are being developed, underscoring the need to thread together this architecture.
Climate and environment are a crucible that might finally force us together—not because it’s strategically beneficial to engage civil society, but because it's strategically necessary to engage civil society. That's the pivot we need to make. I'll get into some of the architecture and what we're thinking about later in my comments. 
I also like how you talk about the spectrum of civil society—I like to use the term social economy or social sector actors. We're calling the new facility we're launching today the Civil Society and Social Innovation Alliance because we think of a spectrum of actors, from traditional CDOs, CSOs, NGOs, service delivery, advocacy organizations, through to what might be B Corp, social enterprises, and impact-based businesses. There's a huge spectrum of actors that exist between public and private space that we need to bring in, and there are scalable solutions. The number one thing I often hear is, ""This is cute, this is nice, but it isn’t scalable."" That's a false narrative. We have a lot of scalable solutions, especially when we start working through coalitions, networks, and building a global civic architecture.
This is something that a friend and colleague, the CEO of Counterpart International, recently called the need to build a global civil architecture. How are we linking the local to the global, the localization agenda to the decolonization of aid? We can see all these things out there, but what does it really mean in the context of this big international financial architecture reform? What's the role of civil society in the big picture?
These are the big questions we really need to start answering today. The Middle East is a great case, but there are many others, whether in Latin America, Africa, or elsewhere. In these places there are similar patterns emerging globally right now. It is a moment to really think about how we build this new architecture.
Mr. Todman: Amy, a lot of the support for civil society comes from donor governments in the region, and many of the initiatives that I found rely on government or international government support. How do you think donor governments should consider the potential of civil society, both in the environmental sphere and globally, and what they are getting right and wrong in terms of their support? 
Amy Hawthorne: Thank you Will, and thank you so much to CSIS for inviting us here today. I want to congratulate you and your co-author on this incredible report, which is really path-breaking. There are a couple of big things in my view, that donors today are getting right about support for civil society. The first is just a recognition that civil society is a legitimate and a necessary actor and partner for donors. This might sound like an obvious point, but as recently as 15 years ago, 10 years ago, this wasn't necessarily the case. 
So I think it really does represent progress—significant progress—in terms of what I've seen over the course of my career tracking this issue closely in the MENA region: the sort of mainstreaming and legitimation of the concept of civil society as a really crucial development partner—the idea that supporting government, supporting states, supporting national institutions, is simply not enough, and that there's this whole other space out there that both Hajar and Aly talked about that is so rich and diverse and crucial. That's a really big thing that donors are getting right, and we shouldn't take that for granted. It's taken many years to get us to that point.
The second thing that I believe donors are getting right in the main is that there are aspects of the localization agenda that really benefit civil society in the region, or have the potential to really benefit and strengthen civil society in the region. The whole concept of localization is something very, very important, if we're talking about strengthening civil society and creating a sustainable civil society sphere in all of these countries. 
There are, however, some very big things that I think donors have really gotten wrong in the main when it comes to civil society support. The first one is, to be a bit blunt about it, just an utter failure on the part of donors to really play any significant productive role in countering and pushing back against the closing civic space that this region has been experiencing, particularly over the past 10 or 15 years.
For those of our viewers and our audience today who are younger, it may seem hard to believe that 10 to 15 years ago, there was actually more space for civil society in most countries in this region. The space is so limited today. But, in fact, there was a little bit more room in some countries for civil society, activism, advocacy, engagement, etc. One of the major trends that has happened in this region since the 2011 Arab uprisings is a concerted effort by regional governments to close space for civic actors and to increase the penalties and punishments for activism and for receiving unauthorized donor funds and for countering the regime's narratives, etc. This has been an overarching trend. And all donors, in my view—whether it is the multilateral institutions, whether it is the EU, whether it is the United States, whether it is the Japanese government, etc.—have all in their way, really failed to use their leverage and influence to push back against governments in the region who are trying to suppress and control and weaken civil society. 
What we see is two conflicting big trends. The first one, as I mentioned, is a deeper acceptance and legitimation on the part of donors of the role of civil society. But, that is happening in a context in which the space for civil society across the board in this region has become more and more constrained and controlled. That is my overarching assessment of what donors are getting right and wrong when it comes to civil society support—across all sectors of activity, not simply environmental activism.
Mr. Todman: Absolutely. Part of the reason that I chose the countries I did, was to try to get a range of some of these different political environments, and some of them—Tunisia, unfortunately, is probably the main case of this—are experiencing a narrowing of that space in which civil society actors can have impact. And, if we go back, it was Tunisian civil society actors that won the Nobel Peace Prize for their work on the Quartet, on the transition to democracy. Part of that chapter of the report looks at how to navigate this new space. 
Aly, if I can come back to you, bearing in mind all the challenges that we've been talking about, what does success look like for civil society in terms of engaging in international development projects or trying to drive environmental action? What sort of metrics should we be looking at to know if they are really having a positive impact or not?
Mr. Rahim: One of the challenges is the “projectization” of space and its fragmentation. Hajar was getting to this a little bit. I think that's very good. With civil society organizations, there's also a trend that is linked to closing civic space, and that's a diminishment and fragmentation of funding. It’s very hard for a lot of CSOs to access funding, and who they access funding from actually plays to the civic space issue. 
When funding is nested, let's say in the World Bank, it's very different for government to say, “we're going to shut that cap off.” That’s part and parcel; it's linked to a World Bank project; has a status of international treaty. There's very different parameters of clawing back funding. Whereas, if you're getting a grant from the Open Society Foundation, or one of their networks, there's different perception. All of these actors are important. But what we've lacked, is a systematic funding source. That's also why we, at times, lack systematic metrics. The metrics are often very project-bound. They're very time-bound. 
And what you talk about here—I think the metrics go to your sustainability principles: What is making this politically sustainable, socially sustainable? How are we building new systems? How are we building new capacities within government to engage with civil society? The supply side matters and the demand side. How are we realizing network effects? This also goes to civil society’s side. You see increasing coalitions. You see increasing networks. You see southern-based intermediary organizations that can support smaller organizations—because not every small CSO should develop capacity to access USAID funding. The transaction costs of that aren't good, but that's almost what our current system requires: maintain an M&E framework that aligns with what a bilateral donor or major international philanthropy monitors. You're wasting that CSO’s capacity and energy, which should be directed to its strengths. That doesn’t mean that they soon received those monies. 
That's why the civic architecture piece matters so much. Projectization is a problem in development writ large, but it's especially a problem in scaling the strategic role of civil society. While we see great work from civil society around the world, including in the Middle East, we're seeing a failure to scale a lot of these initiatives, because, we lack that link to government, and a lot of the entities—the international actors’ role, which you said—can help via brokerage, and that's what we want to do more of at the World Bank. The IFIs and multilaterals are actually hugely under-leveraged tools. At times in our history, we had used more leveraged with this, and when we do, it makes a big difference. 
The biggest time this probably happened was when I first joined the Bank 20 years ago, when Jim Wolfensohn became president. This was part and parcel, a core part of his Bank’s reforms were about how to bring participation—civil society actors and NGOs into development. It was revolutionary at the time, and while we progress and internalize that considerably in our DNA, it's not the same as it was then. It was real vision and thinking about how we do this. That's why I keep going back to the renewal of the international financial architecture. This is the big discussion about how we make development dollars more effective, how we connect the Sustainable Development Goals to climate and environment. 
The civil society narrative is not well-articulated enough. We need a local-to-global discussion about what this piece means. We need to connect the philanthropic environment, the multilateral environment, the bilateral environment. The place where most of these monies will come from—and increasingly, in different countries, you see this in the Gulf states, for example—there is also a burgeoning domestic resource base for a lot of these initiatives. However, it's certain countries where those are housed, and there's different dynamics. 
How do we connect the funding ecosystem so that we can have more systemic metrics? I think that matters region by region, country by country, but also globally. And there needs to be a concerted effort around this.
Mr. Todman: The questions are coming in from the audience already. One of them is actually from my colleague, Marty Pimentel, exactly on this point. His question is: could you expand on the differences between the ways that philanthropies and multilateral organizations support environmental action? And you said that we need this more synchronized approach, what are the barriers to that at the moment?
Mr. Rahim: If I take the World Bank as a specific example, we are an institution designed for sovereign lending to governments. Our clients are described as governments. We have commitments to citizen engagement, participation, impact on beneficiaries, but we do see our clients as government. We lend our money to governments, and to the private sector through our private sector arm. We do recognize the role civil society plays, but our primary funding engineering is to channel money through governments. Philanthropies offer some support to government but are generally supporting NGOs and nonprofits. Bilaterals have a mix of support, so they're a very different funding ecosystem. 
But let’s say, I heard the case of water, I heard the case of a solid waste management project. I heard all these things. The largest public financing for those comes from the multilateral development institutions, and most of those projects won't have an explicit funding piece linked to civil society actors. Some of them will, and there are great examples around the world, from us, from the Asia Development Bank, and others. But if we want these things to scale, if we want them to genuinely influence—and this is at the core of your report, which struck me so much when you reached out to me—we need to connect the nodes. International actors together need to thread that connection with governments.
When we do that, when bilateral actors are doing that, when multilateral actors are doing that, you help create a space for this work to flourish. You create a safe umbrella. Let's say you're doing a large-scale energy transition project. How are you going to think about benefit sharing? How are you going to think about stakeholder consultations in a systematic way? How are you going to think about beneficiary feedback into project design?
We have these elements built into our design principles, even in the multilaterals, but we don't have effective vehicles to bridge in those partnerships. We’re trying to build that more. This is the idea behind CIVIC, our new successor. It's reflected in the IDA Replenishment paper. It's been committed to by our bank leadership. Ajay Banga announced this at our annual meetings last week. So, our leadership is seeing the importance of this. We're going to have a new indicator in the bank's corporate scorecard, which has two parts. We want to show a more concerted effort around development results. There's 20 outcomes of development we're going to drive. And there's 20 or so indicators in an organizational effectiveness dashboard, which is going to be public to the world, on how we're effective in doing this.
One of those indicators is going to be on civic and citizen engagement. This will also hold us to account on how we do better. But I think at the end of the day, more money has to also be nested in the multilateral system to support civil society. Many people have been pressing for that, and we need to see how these different actors come together. Within the context of these projects, it should just be taken for granted that there is a piece that involves financing, partnership, delivery, and oversight that comes from civil society's key actors, in delivery of large-scale financing. 
Mr. Todman: Hajar, earlier on, you started to talk about the different levels at which civil society actors are working, some at the really local level, some at the provincial or regional level, some at the national level, even some at the international level. Could you talk to us about what level you think civil society, at this stage, is the best place to have an impact at? Should we be focusing on one of those levels over another, or do we need people to be working at all of those levels? 
Ms. Khamlichi: Before answering, I would like to thank Amy and Aly for bringing all of their interesting comments, because it triggers a lot of other thinking in me. I really agree with all of what has been said. I just want to flag that 83% of civil society engagement is voluntary based in the MENA region. We just have 17%, and this 17% covers big foundations related to governments. It's a very tiny portion of civil society that gets funded and gets to the stage of “professionalization” of their work. That's really through sustainability and retaining capabilities. With good capabilities, they can deliver the right work and the right progress for communities.
This is very important—and the multiyear funding is detrimental in this sense: that neither international cooperation nor philanthropies are there yet. This is what makes the difference between the civil society of the Global North and the Global South. In the North, they get to be professional and have their civil society work be their main role in their daily lives. In the South, we can’t seize the passion. We can’t expand engagement; it doesn’t currently harness all the experience among the people in an effective way. 
Coming back to your question, all three levels are important. Civil society has strong short-term impacts, especially at the local level, where they build ties with municipalities, local authorities, private sectors, and urban or rural communities. This proximity enables them to address specific environmental issues and drive behavioral change within these communities. Local policy changes are generally easier to achieve compared to sub-national, national, or international levels. However, the sub-national level is important for addressing more complex issues, depending on governance structures. For instance, in some countries, water management is a sub-national responsibility, while waste is local, and energy is national. Civil society must adapt to these different governance levels, engaging the appropriate stakeholders for each topic.
At the national level, civil society advocates for policy, regulation, monitoring, and progress—although limited civil society space makes this challenging, as Amy mentioned. Nevertheless, organizations adapt creatively to pursue their goals. Bringing civil society representatives into international networks is crucial, amplifying their local and national perspectives globally. Currently, there are limited MENA representatives in these spaces, which are often dominated by Western or Global North perspectives. Increasing this representation can help address local needs and cultural contexts effectively.
Supporting civil society requires building structural, organizational, and other capacities, enabling local communities to confidently shape their own futures. The path from local to global is achievable, as evidenced by impacts and challenges in this transition. It’s promising to see a MENA grassroots organization actively participating in World Bank meetings, thanks to philanthropic support that has bolstered professional capacity.
Mr. Todman: This is a perfect segway because we had a question come in from Shivan Anand at the Center for New American Security who asks: How important is representation for smaller Middle Eastern states that have fewer resources on a global stage? For example, representation at the COP conference. Can it actually yield scenario specific solutions? Hajar, speaking to us as someone from Morocco currently at COP, what are the solutions you’re hoping to uncover by being there?
Ms. Khamlichi: The first thing that comes to my mind is bringing the voice of these communities to the international scene. It seems very basic, but it's not basic. It's very crowded in terms of ideas, positions, and the way we see the world. Bringing those voices together is imperative. We notice some voices already here trying to do this work.
Secondly, defending the right to development for the developing countries in the region that need to progress in a sustainable, green world. The other thing is the loss and damage which is a very hot topic. Even in developing countries, there is not a correct understanding of who is deserving of compensation. There is a wide range of subjects, not solutions, but they are political subjects that need to be tackled. We are on our way to solutions if the international and multilateral spheres allow it. The main challenge with solutions so far is finance. There is a feeling that the money is there, but how do we pin it down? That is the big question at COP and abroad. Where are we going to get that money to implement renewable energy projects in the MENA region and Africa? Where will money come from to enable new economies that are based on clean pathways? Where will money come from to allow more access to education, knowledge, and development? These are very complex topics individually and finding the funding for adaptation and for solutions is crucial. I’m not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel yet.
Mr. Todman: Amy, I wonder if you could help us think through some of the politics of this. Part of what I tried to explore in the report is the fact that, as you said, we're seeing a closing space for civic activity in many countries across the region. You've spent a lot of time working in some very challenging political contexts. Can we realistically expect civil society to have an impact in these places? And what kinds of groups have you seen that are best able to navigate the political constraints on civic association and advocacy? 
Ms. Hawthorne: Thanks. We can expect civil society to have an impact in closed political spaces. I am constantly impressed, amazed, and humbled by what colleagues manage to achieve in countries in the Middle East and North Africa under daunting circumstances and with numerous challenges and pressures. Overall, we must keep our expectations modest, as achieving lasting, major change is extremely difficult in any society, especially those lacking basic rights and freedoms. Closed political environments make everything harder, from governance to activism to local development.
Looking at the last 10 to 15 years, civil society is making an impact, especially at the local level. As Hajar mentioned, citizen-led organizations work in their communities to make positive changes. On a broader national level, however, social movements—not necessarily civil society organizations or NGOs—seem to have the most impact. Social movements are much broader, encompassing various associations, groups, and leaders. These broad coalitions often take a conflictual approach, challenging governments and regimes through mobilization, a tactic that can make some donors uncomfortable. Donors don’t always support social movements, and social movements may not seek or welcome donor support.
While there are examples of bottom-up, citizen-led change, I'm sober in my expectations. Many citizen-led social movements in the region, pushing for positive change on issues citizens care about, face two significant challenges. First, regimes often take bold steps to crush or weaken these movements, blunting their impact. Second, within the movements themselves, fragmentation and conflict can emerge, weakening these coalitions. This issue isn't unique to the MENA region; it’s difficult to keep broad coalitions with diverse interests together over the long term.
Therefore, I have modest expectations about civil society’s potential achievements. In the environmental arena specifically, as Hajar mentioned, there are promising examples of local issues where civil society can engage with local stakeholders and decision-makers. However, regarding the broader environmental and climate crisis in this region, it’s my view that national governments and international actors hold the most power and responsibility to implement policy changes essential for potential solutions. It has been incredibly challenging for civil society to influence national policies in this area.
Mr. Todman: You touched on so many points that I’ve wrestled with over the last year or so. How do civil society actors go from mobilizing in opposition to something to mobilizing thought toward solutions? It’s so difficult because it requires bringing in technical aspects while continuing to mobilize through advocacy.
One initiative that stuck with me is a group in Tunisia called, “Manish Msab” which means, “I Am Not a Garbage Dump.” They mobilized against a landfill that the government kept renewing beyond its intended lifespan. They used art, organized street protests, and mobilized their community against this issue. Ultimately, about a year after the landfill closed, they wanted to keep building on this movement but weren’t sure how. I think there’s room for international actors to step in, connecting them with environmental experts who can help with solutions.
Aly, since your work focuses on accountability in climate and the environment, what role do you see for civil society in bolstering accountability, especially in more challenging environments where the political context isn’t open?
Mr. Rahim: Great question. I’m really enjoying this discussion because an interesting aspect of these discussions, as reflected in your report and by my colleagues, is that the problem diagnosis is widely known, and solutions are also fairly understood. For anyone working in this area meaningfully, while there are points of difference, the theory of change here is clear. The challenge is how we build out this architecture.
You’ve raised an essential point about this critical intersection. Oppositional social change is crucial to the evolution of science and climate action, yet we often overlook the “convergence space.” For example, the GPSA and Open Government Partnership emerged from this space, which has always been vital, though sometimes our focus on large-scale development and finance shifts attention away from it. Climate change is the crucible that will hopefully prompt political leaders to recognize the need to expand this shared space.
I remember when Obama launched the Open Government Partnership, he emphasized that trust, integrity, and participation are the only viable pathways to achieving these goals. When I took on this portfolio two years ago, we knew we needed to integrate accountability into climate finance. There were discussions on whether this work should continue at the World Bank. We had to think about how we use our funds to model where we go. We launched the Global Green Accountability Initiative with a focus on working at scale, emphasizing the importance of connecting local to national to regional to global levels. We used Jonathan Fox’s concept of “vertical integration,” linking voices from local actors up to global climate negotiations at COP. But let’s be frank—this isn’t happening at scale. When it does, it’s often through isolated actors or regions.
To address this, we’ve developed the green accountability platform through a North-South consortium of civil society partners, creating a network that pilots in Bangladesh, Mexico, Senegal, Brazil, and Cameroon. These countries face significant climate challenges from different angles and civil society contexts. In each, we work to promote participatory decision-making and support local organizations while connecting them across various institutions. For example, in Senegal, we’re funding a network of 50 organizations focused on mangrove preservation, an essential ecosystem for climate resilience. This work requires local-level collaboration rather than top-down funding approaches, which are often insufficient. This requires close activity at the local level surrounding what is being done, who is doing it, and its oversight. The organizations that can do this exist, but they’re not funded or capacitated and lack digital solutions.
We need more connectivity between these ecosystems, as well as evidence to show policymakers that this participatory approach tangibly impacts outcomes. Last year, we commissioned a report titled “Better Accountability, Better Finance,” with Systemic which explores the effects of transparency, participation, and accountability in climate finance. These efforts aim to demonstrate that there’s no net-zero pathway without this approach.
The scale required is massive, and we’re just starting, but major institutions like the World Bank are beginning to recognize this need. If we don’t adequately fund and systematize civil society efforts, we risk superficial support, which won’t drive the change needed.
Mr. Todman: I could discuss this for hours, but I want to extend a huge thank you to all three of you for sharing such valuable insights. The main takeaways I’ve noted are connecting, scaling, and systematizing—how do we make civil society a truly strategic partner in this? As I mentioned at the start, I published a report that explores some of these themes, available on the CSIS website. For a quicker overview, we also have an executive summary, audio brief, one-page country fact sheets, and an Arabic translation coming soon.
Thank you to my CSIS colleagues, especially my co-author, Martin Pimentel, Ali Dabaje, and my colleagues in the AV team, Dhanesh and Dwayne. A special thank you as well to Bahaa Hariri, whose financial support has made this project possible. There’s so much more to discuss, but I hope this is just the beginning of leveraging civil society’s potential to drive environmental action and resilience in the Middle East and North Africa. Thank you.

Seth G. Jones: Welcome, everyone. I have the honor of welcoming, for this great discussion, Brett Holmgren, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, who was appointed by the president on July 18th, 2024. NCTC – I probably don’t need to provide much information on NCTC because I think everyone is aware of its background – but was formed after 9/11, and it is the U.S. government’s primary organization responsible for integrating, analyzing, and sharing information to protect the U.S. from terrorism and achieving some of the national counterterrorism objectives.
Mr. Holmgren served for nearly three years as the U.S. assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Intelligence and Research. Also served as special assistant to the president and senior director for intelligence programs on the National Security Council staff. Began his career on counterterrorism at the Defense Intelligence Agency, and then moved over to become a senior analyst at the CIA. Also is a, I’m assuming very proud, graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Which means he’s a Badger with an M.A. in global security studies from Johns Hopkins University.
So, welcome. Really glad to have you.
Brett Holmgren: Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, Seth. And the most important line in there is I’m a proud Wisconsin Badger. So thank you for – thank you for that.
Seth, I also just want to thank you for your thought leadership on – really, on terrorism and on national security issues generally. As I noted in the way up, been a fan of your work for some time. So it’s a real pleasure to be here with you.
I also want to thank CSIS for hosting today’s event. And the purpose of CSIS is to define the future of national security. So it’s only fitting that my remarks today are intended to help define the future of the global terrorism landscape.
This past September, we celebrated the National Counterterrorism Center’s 20th anniversary. We honored the outstanding work of the tens of thousands of NCTC officers past and present who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes to keep Americans safe from terrorism at home and abroad. Their work and their contributions to our nation’s security is why I’m so proud to lead this extraordinary organization.
Now, in reflecting on NCTC’s history it was helpful to reflect on how much the global terrorism landscape has changed since President George W. Bush established NCTC in 2004. At that time Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri were still plotting from caves in Afghanistan and Pakistan. U.S. forces were deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan engaged in two wars.
In Iraq and elsewhere a group called ISIS didn’t exist. In the United States you didn’t have to remove your shoes at the airport. So a lot has changed over these last 20 years. The only constant is the ever-evolving nature of the threat itself. Terrorism in all its forms is underpinned ultimately by violent extremist ideology.
Ideologies can’t be defeated by governments or counterterrorism tools alone but what we can do and what we must do is have a clear-eyed assessment of the threat in order to design and implement smart, sustainable approaches that manage risks responsibly and wisely consistent with our values.
So this afternoon I’d like to describe the global terrorism threat and touch on how the U.S. government has worked aggressively to counter this evolving challenge over the last few years.
Now, today’s terrorism threat is unfolding amid tectonic shifts in the international system, a profound moment in a world marked by volatility, instability, and hostility. Governments are confronting multiple crises simultaneously involving state and nonstate actors while also trying to manage transnational issues like migration and climate change and cyber.
In this context terrorist groups like ISIS have found ways to exploit the circumstances, especially in the Middle East and Africa, to slowly and quietly rebuild. As a result, today we are in yet another transformational phase of the global terrorism landscape, a threat that is more diverse, more complex, and more decentralized.
Now, it’s more diverse because the ideological motivations and the range of foreign terrorist actors are multi-dimensional. Whereas in the past we focused mainly on monolithic groups like al-Qaida, ISIS, and Hezbollah, today’s actors also include transnational, racially, and ethnically motivated extremists, or REMVEs, anti-government and anti-authoritarian groups, home-grown violent extremists, or HVEs, and, of course, Iranian-linked entities, in particular the IRGC Quds Force.
The threat is more decentralized and distributed around the world. This is in large part due to CT successes over multiple administrations, which had the effect of forcing these groups to disperse and to operate in smaller cells in more locations to survive. As an example, the changing nature of ISIS’ footprint in Syria and its expansion across Africa reflects this new reality.
Finally, the threat is more complex because terrorists are more skilled technologically. They’re using 3-D printing and artificial intelligence to produce weapons and enhance propaganda, they’re communicating on more sophisticated platforms, and they’re turning to crypto currency and alternative payment platforms to finance their operations.
So that’s the contemporary global terrorism landscape – more diverse, decentralized, and complex – and against that backdrop let me situate the current threat to the United States.
In September of 2023 my predecessor Christy Abizaid noted that thanks to focused efforts across many administrations the terrorism threat to the U.S. homeland had been dramatically reduced to its lowest level in decades and she was right.
Unfortunately, a month later Hamas’ horrific terrorist attack on Israel and the ensuing conflict and tragedy in Gaza served as a galvanizing event for terrorist groups worldwide and it happened to come at a time when ISIS Syria and ISIS-Khorasan had begun rebuilding core capabilities.
Now, this year alone ISIS-K’s attacks in Russia and Iran, multiple ISIS linked or inspired attacks in Germany, hundreds of ISIS attacks throughout Africa, and the first ever ISIS associated attack in Amman they all signal a reenergized global ISIS enterprise.
And so today the United States and many other countries are facing an elevated terrorist threat. In addition to the Israel-Hamas conflict, a convergence of factors are driving this elevated threat environment, including new migration patterns spurred in part by Putin’s unprovoked war in Ukraine, growing political and economic grievances worldwide, and technological advances exploited by terrorist groups.
Now, here in the homeland we continue to assess that individuals who are inspired, enabled, or directed by foreign terrorist organizations, so called HVEs, pose the most serious threat to American citizens. Since 9/11, HVEs inspired or enabled by foreign terrorist organizations have conducted 45 of the 49 terrorist attacks in the United States. And the Afghan national arrested in Oklahoma last month who was charged with conspiring to conduct a terrorist attack on election day on behalf of ISIS represents the type of foreign terrorist-associated threat that we’re most concerned about domestically.
Now, elsewhere ISIS-K and ISIS-Syria are the two most potent elements of the ISIS global enterprise. In Syria, ISIS exploited reduced counterterrorism pressure last year to recover and to rebuild, as governments shifted attention and resources to the conflict in Gaza. They’ve used a base of operations in central Syria to drive external plotting, turning this desert location into the current locus of plotting against the West, including the United States. They’ve also benefited from improved finances and stronger media and propaganda campaigns.
In Yemen, al-Qaida in the Arabia Peninsula remains and retains the desire to attack the United States homeland, but U.S. counterterrorism actions and the ongoing war in Yemen have constrained AQAP’s ability to reconstitute. Meanwhile, in South Asia, Taliban pressure on ISIS-K has forced key elements of the group to relocate to Pakistan. And while recent Pakistani operations have begun to target ISIS-K, sustained pressure will be needed to prevent the group from expanding further.
Now for years, experts worried that groups like al-Qaida would turn Africa into the next global jihadist battleground. These dynamics are already well established in East Africa and places like Somalia, but they are now also beginning to unfold in the Sahel and West Africa where ISIS and al-Qaida, through its operational arm called JNIM, are expanding their presence and intensifying attacks. Just for example, the number of ISIS and al-Qaida-linked attacks in West Africa and the Sahel are on pace to double from 1,500 in 2021 to a little more than 3,000 by the end of this year.
Now, ISIS and JNIM have exploited weak governance, local grievances, and affected local security forces’ political instability to spread their ideology among vulnerable populations. Moreover, in places like Mali and Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, these groups have capitalized on the actions of Russia, including private military companies like Wagner, whose so-called counterterrorism operations have made the situation worse, resulting in human rights abuses, civilian casualties, and actually increasing recruits for these organizations.
Now, for now while ISIS and al-Qaida are mostly focused on local interests in Africa, their continued expansion and recruitment of fighters from outside the continent would position them well to pursue external operations in the future. And for all these reasons, Africa is emerging as the center of gravity for the Sunni extremist movement. And if left unchecked, could become a much more acute, long-term threat to U.S. interests.
In response, the United States and European partners have been investing in a more geographically diverse and reliable set of counterterrorism relationships in Central and West Africa, and are taking a more forward-looking and strategic approach to these and other challenges in the region. So in the time remaining let me just summarize key elements of the U.S. government’s response to the threat. And as set forth in National Security Memorandum 13 on U.S. international counterterrorism policy, issued in 2022, the administration’s approach has been guided by several key principles.
Among them, prioritizing finite counterterrorism resources against the groups that pose a direct threat to the United States. Second, investing in international partnerships and maintaining U.S. global leadership. Third, promoting civilian-led non-kinetic approaches where possible. And finally, optimizing intelligence community collection and analysis on the groups of greatest concerns. These are just some of the principles outlined in the strategy.
Now, when it comes to prioritizing anti-U.S. threats, counterterrorism actions at home and abroad in recent months exemplify this approach. For instance, as ISIS began rebuilding in Syria earlier this year, the U.S. military has since conducted numerous strikes and raids that have removed dozens of ISIS leaders and operatives from the battlefield, and this includes multiple strikes by the U.S. military late last month against several ISIS camps in the Syrian desert I mentioned. That has killed dozens of leaders and operatives. As a result, ISIS plots have been disrupted, its leadership and membership ranks have been degraded, and its safe haven in Syria is under the most severe pressure it has faced in years.
Here in the United States, thanks to the excellent work of the FBI, Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, and in cooperation with the intelligence community, two potential ISIS threats to the homeland have been disrupted this year, including the recent plot in Oklahoma that I mentioned earlier.
At the same time, we’ve stepped up foreign engagements. As reports emerged this spring that some Central Asian migrants with violent extremist ideology or possible ISIS links had entered the United States, U.S. officials engaged extensively with Central Asian governments and Turkey to share more information and to crack down on facilitation networks and activities. The United States has also continued to lead internationally through the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. And I attended the recent ISIS – D-ISIS ministerial hosted at the State Department last month, and I can tell you that the 87 countries who comprise this coalition remain laser-focused on cooperating to destroy and dismantle ISIS.
So as we’ve adjusted to deal with a reenergized ISIS, the U.S. government has also engaged with international partners to increase collection, analysis, and disruption efforts against a growing transnational REMVE threat which has inspired mass shootings in the United States and abroad. At NCTC, we have engaged with our Five Eyes nations and European partners to enhance information sharing and leverage best practices on preventing and countering REMVE across borders.
And finally, the IC – the intelligence community – has strengthened collection and analysis on ISIS. We’ve surged linguists with Central Asian backgrounds, and enhanced intelligence screening and vetting support to Homeland Security and border officials.
Now, of course, we know that the threat endures, and that our response to it must be flexible. So in reflecting on the last four years and looking ahead to the future, some takeaways emerge.
First, it’s worth noting that the U.S. approach to counterterrorism has successfully prevented foreign terrorist-directed or -enabled attacks on the U.S. homeland, and the – and continued to reduce the ability of these groups to conduct large-scale attacks on our country. And that is a credit first and foremost to the countless counterterrorism professionals throughout the U.S. government.
Second, as the terrorism threat in Africa metastasizes, an international approach that considers the strategic competition dimensions of the continent will be needed to address the long-term drivers that are allowing terror groups in the region to thrive.
Third, we will need to rethink and diversify our counterterrorism partnerships to reduce dependency risk if a partner’s capabilities fall short or the relationship collapses, as we saw in Niger.
Fourth, the rising number of juveniles engaging in terrorism is a global phenomenon, and it may well worsen in the near term as the effects of the Israel-Hamas conflict take hold. Now, given these global ramifications, pursuing common approaches to prevention with our close partners and allies could yield new insights, new ideas, and more efficient and effective solutions.
And finally, if future administration priorities or global realities limit the U.S. ability to take action against terrorist threats upstream, investing in downstream capabilities like identity intelligence and screening and vetting, which is really our last line of defense here in the United States, will become even more important.
So, in sum, as the United States confronts a new phase in the global terrorism threat, it is important to remember that strategies like NSM 13 are never meant to be static, and that only by internalizing lessons from the last four years can we position the next administration for success. And in that connection let me say that I look forward to engaging with the Trump administration’s national security team to conduct an orderly transition and to ensure that they are ready on day one to address a dynamic CT threat environment. And throughout the transition process, let me reassure you that the U.S. counterterrorism community will be working diligently, as they do each and every day, to keep threats at bay so that our democracy may continue to shine as a beacon of freedom and hope in the world.
And with that, thank you. (Applause.)
Dr. Jones: For the audience, before we start just wanted to remind you to scan questions. So you’ve got a QR code there. If you can’t reach it, you can get up and there’s a – there’s a place to scan it behind you in the back. I’ve got a tablet here that already has some questions on it. So some of you have already gotten started. And when we get partially through, I will start asking some of the questions from folks here in the audience.
Thank you so much for taking the time. And I just want to say, the work that you do, and your colleagues do at NCTC, across the U.S. intelligence community, the military, and then our allies and partners, I just know from experience, save lives. So thank you for all that you and your colleagues are doing. Most of it is done with Americans generally having no idea what is done to protect their freedom. But thank you for all the work that you do on a daily basis.
Mr. Holmgren: Thank you, Seth.
Dr. Jones: I wanted to start actually on the homeland. And so my question is, when you look back at the past 23 years or so since 9/11, there’s certainly – you know, we’ve certainly had very high levels of threats. Certainly, 9/11 itself. A couple of years after that around the 2008-2009 period, we had a couple of very close calls with Najibullah Zazi, which was a plot that came very close to those attacks in New York City. He built the bombs in Denver. Then we had Faisal Shahzad, the Times Square bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the underwear bomber from Yemen who worked with AQAP. So, you know, some periods where we’ve come very close.
You talked a little bit about it in your comments, but as we look at the ebbs and flows of threats to the homeland, can you put that into context where we sit today? I realize we can’t be complacent about the threat, but how would you – in a historical perspective – sort of put where we are right now?
Mr. Holmgren: Yeah. So the way I think about it is sort of three phases. And you’ve pointed to the first one, which was the 9/11 phase and the several – I’d say the probably five to 10 years after that, where groups like al-Qaida, principally, were focused, first and foremost, on conducting large-scale, spectacular attacks that inflicted large numbers of casualties and were designed to garner a lot of media attention. And so they spent a lot of time in the training camps both thinking – you know, planning those operations, vetting and recruiting the right operatives with the right profiles, so that they could infiltrate back into certain countries. And were, you know, very focused on executing – you know, frankly, were willing to forego smaller attacks in the interest of investing in these larger ones.
With the rise of ISIS in 2014 and really 2015, when they were at – the caliphate was at its peak, that when we – I think we began to shift into more of a second phase, where there was a – because of the large numbers of foreign fighters that had flocked to Syria to join ISIS, you saw ISIS leaders really focus on how they could quickly redeploy those individuals back into their home countries. And they were focused really on – they were focused on quality, but also were focused on quantity. So a little bit of a shift. I think they recognized, because of all the counterterrorism measures that had been taken in the last – in the preceding decade, it was just harder to executive, you know, attacks against commercial aircraft, et cetera. So they really focused on the foreign fighter component.
And then where we are now is it’s the inspiration, the enabled kind of attack model, where ISIS in particular is really – the virtual recruitment, the virtual guidance they can provide, and a desire to really throw kind of everything at the wall to see what sticks. I think the media landscape has changed dramatically over the last 20 years. And so from their view, it’s less important that an attack kills large number of people than it simply garners a lot of media attention. And so that’s the model we’re at now.
And that’s why the HVE threat that we face, where these individuals may only have, you know, virtual connections or relationships with ISIS, in some respects – it’s a less sophisticated threat, because they’re not trained in camps. They don’t oftentimes know how to – you know, these are individuals who are new to the fight. So they just don’t have the training that al-Qaida would have provided in years past. They’re focused on simple, but still very deadly and lethal, attacks, obviously. But mass shootings, knife attacks, vehicle ramming incidents. So unsophisticated, but in some respects more difficult to detect. And ultimately, the volume is greater, so it just requires a lot more resources collectively, both here and overseas.
Dr. Jones: Right, because the value for someone like Zazi, when he goes to Pakistan and goes to a training camp, is he comes back reasonably well-qualified to put together a bomb that he can put in a backpack, walk into a subway, and blow himself up. What we see with some of the individuals you’ve described is less sophistication, less concern about killing large numbers of people, but still would have a dramatic effect in the U.S. homeland.
What is – so you did mention some of the plotting, some of the arrests we’ve seen this year, including ISIS, including Oklahoma. Can you talk a little bit about how would you put that into context? How serious were those threats to the homeland? And, just more broadly, you know, what are the lessons you pull out on the counterterrorism side for cooperation to make some of the key arrests that we’ve seen?
Mr. Holmgren: Yeah. Well, first, let me just say they were serious threats. And that is why we have – the collective “we” in the U.S. government and the counterterrorism enterprise – have taken them so seriously. This was the first time in some years where, you know, ISIS had established, you know, effective relationships and communication with individuals in the United States. That’s a big deal. And it’s why we have, I think, aggressively moved and coordinated so much more closely with FBI, with DHS, to make sure that we’ve got all the support at the border to vet individuals as well.
But, you know, ultimately what it comes down to is a combination of excellent, you know, traditional intelligence collection with kind of a faster sharing of that information with our domestic partners – in many cases in real time. And you talk about one of the other evolutions since 9/11, as it pertains – actually, this one pertains to NCTC. You know, I have – I’m here in an acting capacity. Never worked at NCTC. I had the pleasure of working with NCTC over many years. But having stepped into the role this summer, you know, as the U.S. government – you know, there are other threats in the world and resources have necessarily been adjusted to address strategic competition. It’s meant that there have been less resources across the U.S. government for counterterrorism.
The silver lining in that, if there is one, is that it has forced the remaining kind of core CT elements at NCTC – which we’re the only entity that’s focused 24/7 on counterterrorism – but also at the intel agencies, at FBI, elsewhere, to work even more closely together, and to work – and to collaborate in ways that I think, in the past where the resources were plentiful, you maybe wouldn’t see it. So the one silver lining we’ve seen this summer has been, you know, I think NCTC really taking a convening role in bringing the agencies together to really drive threat analysis and to actually surface leads to support our operational partners.
Dr. Jones: Well, part of what you just did is talk a little bit about sort of the origins of NCTC and its evolution. Now, I remember when NCTC’s precursor, TTIC, was established. And then NCTC formally gets off the ground. You know, its focus is – this was after 9/11 – its focus really was on dealing with a major terrorist threat to the homeland that, as you’ve described, evolves from really a focus on al-Qaida, to groups like ISIS, and others. The focus now, and it has been with the last two National Defense Strategies – so first under Trump – the Trump administration, then under Biden.
But under the Trump administration, it was pretty explicit that great-power competition, not counterterrorism, are the primary focuses – now, that’s the National Defense Strategy – of the United States. How have – how have you evolved, or how has NCTC evolved to deal with the growing role of major powers – the Russians, the Iranians, the Chinese – in this sphere? And then I want to come back a little bit later and talk about how to balance activity against state actors with still dealing with the threat from nonstate actors. So, first, how do you – how do you balance the great or the major powers and the – and the nonstate actors?
Mr. Holmgren: Well, our mission – I mean, NCTC’s mission has – it remains unchanged, right? It is to integrate, to analyze, share information first and foremost, to conduct strategic operational planning, to support national counterterrorism policy objectives. It is to maintain the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, which is all the underlying data that helps feed and support our screening, vetting, and watchlisting efforts throughout the U.S. government. And then more recently it is to pursue and to identify terrorist threat leads that we can share with operational agencies to disrupt plots before they occur. So our mission hasn’t changed.
The way we work has changed. And I think it’s shifting much more to an offensive posture where, in addition to doing the traditional analysis, tactical and strategic, where can we really support and drive our state and local partners, you know, if there’s a foreign terrorist nexus, but also to support DOD partners and our intelligence agencies. I think that’s the shift, is we’re playing a more, I think, impactful and meaningful operational support role.
Dr. Jones: So in this gray area, what role have you seen? And has there been an evolution in the role that states play in this arena? I mean, Iran is clearly the biggest example of this with the Quds Force. The Russians, starting in 2015 when they got involved in the campaign in Syria, do work with Hezbollah as part of that ground campaign with the Assad regime and some of the Iraqi, Palestinian, and other forces that came in and conducted offensive operations. So states have been involved in dealing with terrorist groups. How big of a concern is that and a focus is this sort of gray area where states – adversaries, really – may operate in some cases by, with, and through terrorist organizations?
Mr. Holmgren: Well, it should be no surprise that Russia has historically dealt with unsavory groups. And you just mentioned one, Hezbollah, that they continue to deal with. So it should be no surprise that they will leverage kind of many different nonstate actors to pursue their objectives.
You know, I think there are limits to what groups they could work with. Certainly, ISIS-K’s attack in Moscow earlier this year I think is a pretty good indication that relations between ISIS and Russia are not great. And I think as long as you’ve got this large Central Asian Russian-speaking population in ISIS-K, it’s going to be – you know, ISIS continues to plot against Russia even to this day. So wouldn’t rule it out, but you know, I think most of the cooperation we’ve seen that Russia’s provided is in the Hezbollah context.
You know, I think when – on the strategic competition topic generally, you know, one of the things that has stood out to me actually pertains to China. And the PRC has, I think, looked at how effective the U.S. government has been at the counterterrorism challenge over many years through, you know, a lot of experience, both in the battlefield and then also in the – kind of the back-office functions, and they have recognized that offering counterterrorism assistance and training support to nations where they are seeking a strategic advantage is in their benefit.
Now, what’s different, of course, is the PRC approaches these engagements in West Africa – coastal West Africa, you know, with no strings attached to what they can – what they’re offering and what they can provide, notwithstanding, you know, any human rights issues that may exist. And so the – China is using CT as a counter – as a – as a tool to advance their own strategic competition when it comes to – if you think about sort of how they’re looking at the world globally and where they’re trying to check and counter the United States.
Dr. Jones: And I think it’s safe to say the Russians have as well with what we used to call Wagner Group. It’s private military companies.
Mr. Holmgren: It’s private military companies, exactly. Right.
Dr. Jones: So one big question. You mentioned Hezbollah. Can you talk a little bit about the impact on global terrorist organizations of October 7th? Did that ripple through groups? Did that inspire some? What’s been the overall impact of the October 7th attacks in Israel?
Mr. Holmgren: Yeah. We’ve said it was likely to be a generational event and I stand by that assessment.
Unfortunately, the data that we have seen in NCTC – we mentioned this publicly but, you know, more than 40 either attacks or disrupted plots in over, you know, 20 countries just in the last year that have had some link whether inspired or motivated by 7 October.
So it really has had an impact on the ground. I think the bigger impact, though, is that 7 October and then the ensuing conflict came at a time where groups like ISIS and al-Qaida were at some of their lowest operational levels and so it really has – it was a serendipitous time for groups like that and the movement more generally and it provided a shot in the arm when it comes to recruitment, fundraising, and – you know, I think it’ll turn out to be probably the most consequential recruiting event for just the kind of global terrorism movement since we’ve seen in the Iraq war.
Dr. Jones: And how much of it was – just the attack itself on Israel how much of this was the information campaign that came about following October 7th with strikes in Gaza and the wars that unfolded there and in Lebanon?
Mr. Holmgren: It’s tough to say. We don’t have any hard data on kind of what has been the weightier factor but I would say if you look at the propaganda that ISIS and al-Qaida – which, by the way, al-Qaida had never been a close friend of Hamas. They have pretty significant differences.
If you look at what they’ve been putting out it’s the images of the destruction in Gaza and the humanitarian, you know, suffering there. So they’ve really – it’s been much more on that humanitarian kind of side of things in their recruitment videos.
Dr. Jones: So what is your sense of – just turning to some of the groups there, I was just in Israel and Hezbollah – the combination of Israeli strikes against Hezbollah’s leadership including Nasrallah, the pager/walkie-talkie/laptop attacks in the supply chain, and then also the disruption in the command and control networks plus the very limited Israeli ground incursion and some of their strikes against Hezbollah’s ballistic missile capabilities, for the moment do appear to have significantly impacted Hezbollah’s capabilities.
But what is your assessment of where Hezbollah stands today and its possibility for, you know, rejuvenation and revitalization? I mean, it has generally been considered probably the preeminent terrorist organization overseas in capabilities.
Mr. Holmgren: Mmm hmm. So you’re right in that, you know, our assessment is that the Israeli military actions have significantly degraded Hezbollah’s military capabilities. But they had – before the conflict they had built up unprecedented numbers of rockets and missiles and other munitions. So they had – on hand they were starting at a very strong point.
The leadership losses have had an impact on their ability to – I think to organize and to strategically put together a way forward. But the ground forces in the south remain somewhat intact and as it pertains, you know, from a terrorist’s perspective outside the region, you know, their external capabilities have, largely, been untouched.
So in terms of the Islamic jihad organization and that external component of Hezbollah, you know, we assess there’s been little impact thus far. It still remains, you know, down but far from out.
Dr. Jones: Which in years and decades past have led to attacks in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and other locations.
Mr. Holmgren: Right. Right.
Dr. Jones: Yeah.
Mr. Holmgren: And it’ll be no surprise that we are, you know, monitoring very closely for any indication of, you know, Hezbollah seeking to escalate kind of horizontally, and working very closely with partners around the world to focus on that.
Dr. Jones: So your assessment of Hamas, how does that vary – I mean, again, a number of Hamas’ leadership has been taken out, including Sinwar recently. What is your assessment of Hamas to – part of the challenge in Palestinian areas is there’s still – you know, there’s still a lot of – there appears to be a lot of support for Hamas in general over the long run and potential opportunities for them to revitalize. But what is your assessment where Hamas sits right now, particularly since the period prior to October 7th?
Mr. Holmgren: Militarily, they have been significantly diminished. And they’re essentially morphing into an insurgent force on the ground, and they’re turning to small arms and hit-and-run, different types of tactics; you know, lobbing some mortars, you know, into Israel. But they’re really – they’ve been forced to – you know, to keep a very low profile.
Now, having said that, even a diminished Hamas is able – has been able to recruit new members to its ranks, and will likely continue its ability to do so, so long as there is not another viable political option on the ground for, you know, these disaffected young men in Gaza to turn to. And so I think that’s why it’s even – you know, even more important moving forward you’ve got to – in order to undermine the appeal of Hamas, there has to be a more viable political actor on the ground in Gaza to give them – you know, to give – these new recruits for Hamas, to give them a better option.
Dr. Jones: Last question on this stream is if you take a look back over the last few years with the Assad regime’s ability to retake territory in Syria with the help not just the Russians but of the Iranians, with the collapse of the Afghan government, and obviously a continuing relationship between Iran in the Quds Force and Iraqi groups, there’s a lot of – there are a lot of Iranian partners throughout the region – in Lebanon, in Syria, in Iraq, to some degree in Afghanistan, in Yemen with the Houthis. As you look over the next year, what are your concerns about Iranian activity and its relationship with these kinds of organizations? It has been a challenge for the U.S. The Navy has had to – you know, has been deployed to the Red Sea to conduct operations. There’s been a lot of U.S. assets, carrier strike groups pushed into the region. What’s your sense about kind of the challenges ahead over the next year as the Iranians still have a reasonable relationship with groups across the region?
Mr. Holmgren: Well, look, Iran remains the leader of the so-called Axis of Resistance. And it has, as you noted varying degrees of relationships and operational and strategic control over groups – Hezbollah, which is a proxy of Iran, but also, you know, they provide support to groups like the Houthis. But the Houthis are kind of an independent actor; they do their own thing. There are other groups in Iraq, and in particular, you know, Kataib Hezbollah, KH, which has been responsible for the largest number of attacks against U.S. forces in the region over the last year.
I think our concern is that, you know, Iran, you know, increases the use of these groups as part of its shadow war against either us and/or Israel, in part because they, you know – you know, may be concerned about their own capabilities in light of some of the Israeli strikes against them. And so do they decide to even lean more heavily into these groups and encourage them to operate outside of the region is the risk that I think we’re most focused on.
Dr. Jones: And some of them have done that in the past. I mean, I think it’s been interesting to watch where the Houthis, too, have not just utilized Iranian technology for strikes; they’ve actually exported some of that as well.
Last question. And we’ve got a lot of questions from folks in the audience. But last question for you is – this is a little bit of worry for me, so maybe you can push back and tell me I shouldn’t be worried.
There were years, including when I was in the Special Operations community, where we had, you know, a reasonable footprint and a pretty significant battle rhythm of operations against groups in Syria, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Somalia, in Libya, and in West Africa. Our footprint has declined notably, in part because the priority is – of the military has been the major powers, and so what it’s meant is a withdrawal of a number of forces. As you noted, the U.S. still does have capabilities that it can strike and has struck ISIS and other targets in places like Syria. The current administration in the U.S. killed Ayman al-Zawahiri in Afghanistan as well. So there are capabilities to do that, but it’s not as easy as it once was. We don’t have all of the intelligence capabilities. It’s harder to get access to places like Afghanistan because we don’t have basing in and around that area.
So the big question for you is, where do we have to be careful about pulling back too much from dealing with terrorism? And where do we run risks of not keeping a foot on the pedal against it? Because I think the worry a little bit in some quarters is that if we’re not careful, we take our foot off the pedal a little bit too much, some of these groups will strike us whether they’re Shia groups linked to Iran, groups linked to ISIS including inspired ones, or ones to al-Qaida. So how do we manage that when we’ve withdrawn forces from a lot of areas? I know AFRICOM would like more military resources; they don’t have that right now, so.
Mr. Holmgren: Well, look, as a lifelong counterterrorism professional, you always want as much as you can possibly have, whether it’s collection or operational capabilities on the ground. Having said that, again as someone who has been in a role where, you know, terrorism was one of several portfolios that, you know, I had to focus on every day, I recognize that the threat landscape – the global threat landscape has changed in the world over the last 10 years. And in some respects, that’s a credit to the counterterrorism community because of the success, again, over many years that’s allowed policymakers to accept some risk in the CT fight and to invest those resources in other areas, whether it’s – whether it’s Asia or now Ukraine.
Having said that, I think as we have seen in the last – really, the last 18 months in particular with a reenergized ISIS, and the growth of ISIS and JNIM in Africa, you know, we sort – we have to be very deliberate about how we manage these competing resources moving forward because – and that includes, by the way, the threat to the United States here in the homeland, because, you know, our security is not a birthright. You’ve got to invest it – you’ve got to invest in it. You have to constantly pay attention to it. And you know, for the most part, here in the United States people can wake up and go to work every day and drive their kids to school and go to soccer games not worry about another 9/11. And when I fly on an airplane, I don’t – I have very little worry about that commercial airliner in the United States being subject to a terrorist attack. But that’s because of all of the capability that we invested, the screening and the – and the intelligence fusion activities, whether it’s at the airport or with our domestic agencies.
But security is – it’s a lot like oxygen. When you have it, you don’t think anything about it. The minute you can’t breathe, that’s all you can think about. And so, to me, that is a reminder that we have drawn down resourcewise across the government when it comes to CT over the last few years. We’re stabilizing now. And that – and it’s been adjusted and calibrated to the current threat environment, and I think it’s moving forward.
We’ve got to be – we’ve got to be agile in our capabilities to remove direct threats to us. We’ve got to be – I think we’ve got to be careful about depending too much on particular areas where we host those capabilities. And we’ve got to make sure that we are investing both in the last line of defense here in the United States. And that means all of the really – especially with all the changes in the technology environment, making sure that we have fully interoperable systems between the intelligence community and our folks at the border, so that they can make sure that we’ve got the border threat addressed.
And then, over the horizon, whether it’s finished capabilities or intelligence collection, if we are unable as an intel community to provide that tactical and strategic indications and warning, that is when we run the risk of being blinded by the emergence of, you know, some new group in Africa who, all of a sudden, is plotting against the United States. We can’t let that happen. So we’ve got to continue to invest in these core capabilities.
Dr. Jones: So, sort of along those lines, want to get to a number of questions. This is from someone in the audience who asks: What guidance recommendations would you provide to the next administration to sustain these successes, including this year in the U.S. homeland, that NCTC has benefitted from, historically?
Mr. Holmgren: Well, I just mentioned a couple of them. I think looking at our partnerships around the world we’ve had some extraordinary successes in the partnership front just over the last four years in places like Africa. You know, there’s more work to do. And so one is I think taking a fresh look at our CT partnerships and making sure that we are not overly dependent on any of them, including with some of our closest friends and partners. We’ve been, as reported publicly, heavily dependent on the Israelis. And they were, you know, caught off guard on 7 October. So it’s a reminder that we’ve got to – we’ve got to make sure that we have all the right resources and capabilities in place that can protect the United States.
Dr. Jones: Yeah, and I think we were caught off guard too. I mean, our intelligence community was caught off guard, to some degree. Actually as, I think, were the Egyptians, the Jordanians, the Qataris, and a number of others as well.
Mr. Holmgren: Mmm hmm. Yeah. Yeah, it’s not unique, but the point is making sure that we are not overly dependent. Secondly, is, again, on the identity intelligence and on the screening and vetting. Just incredibly, incredibly vital that we are investing in the technology to make sure that that data is available to the homeland security folks who need it, kind of when they need it. Going to become even more important moving forward.
And then the proliferation of the commercial, you know, unmanned aircraft systems, the UASes, both commercial but, in some respects, even the military, the conventional grade. This is obviously a growth market for a lot of nations, including some of our close friends overseas that are benefiting from these sales. And we get that. But when terrorist groups are acquiring and reconfiguring these things for their own nefarious purposes, just, you know, imagine the threat that the proliferation of these types of capabilities would pose to our facilities overseas that are not hardened.
And so we’ve got to – I think investing in – and, again, these things are not – it’s not that you can’t defend against them. They’re not indefensible. But you’ve got to be – you’ve got to have the right technology in place. You’ve got to have the right kind of hardening capabilities in place at key facilities. And then you’ve got to scale and be able to provide some of the countermeasures at scale at a cost, efficient way. So.
Dr. Jones: Sounds good. Well, hopefully that advice will be followed. Here’s another question from one of the audience members. What’s driving youth radicalization in the U.S.? And if it’s the internet, how do you limit radicalization online? You know, there may be also a secondary question because you’ve mentioned before this – you’re seeing juveniles involved in terrorism as well. So there’s a U.S. component, but also there’s a juvenile component that I know you’ve tracked as well.
Mr. Holmgren: There is. And obviously when it, you know, comes the youth radicalization in the United States, FBI and DHS have the lead mission for that. We at NCTC look at it from the foreign terrorist organization, you know, kind of what influence are they having on radicalization here in the United States. And again, this is not unique to our – to the United States. It is an equally significant problem, especially in Western Europe.
It was – you know, COVID-19 didn’t help. And this, again, not unique to the terrorism problem set. But you had a large number of young individuals who were online for large portions of the day. And especially those who were already in vulnerable settings, they have – you know, they have gravitated – the ones that have linked up with ISIS or have been inspired by ISIS, you know, they’re looking for belonging and meaning, and a real – a sense of accomplishment. And so these – a lot of the propaganda, it’s easily accessible on the social media platforms. It is – a lot of it’s in English.
And it’s not just – in the day, it used to – back in the day, it used to be just al-Qaida or groups – you know, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula who would use the Inspire magazine. Now you have many different groups that are focusing on the English language thing. So I think first and foremost is – I think there is a lot more work to do both here and abroad on the prevention side. That was a big focus many years ago. It’s hard, but figuring out ways that we can reinvest in some of these local communities, and with parents, and faith leaders to try to identify those individuals who are engaging online before they move, very quickly, into the radicalization phase.
And then also, look, a number of the social media companies are now – they’re no longer U.S.-based. And so they’re overseas, or they have overseas ownership. I think, you know, in the first instance, really working with some of our foreign partners to encourage these companies to enforce some of the voluntary standards around, you know, content moderation when it comes to violent extremist media is an area that there’s more work to do.
Dr. Jones: We don’t have time for a lot more questions, but we’ve got a couple that I think we can probably squeeze in. 127 Echo programs have been the bedrock of success against AQI and ISIS in Syria and Iraq. This is someone from the audience. Do you see these types of programs as a viable part of our counterterrorism efforts in Africa? Are other tools also of great value?
Mr. Holmgren: I think – yeah. I think in Africa, especially when it comes to the Sahel and West Africa, again, a lot of – a lot of these – a lot of these governments have very basic security capabilities, but even less basic when it comes to counterterrorism capabilities. And so I think starting with the fundamentals, I think if we try to do too much too soon we’re going to overwhelm a very, very small – a lot of times very, very small security forces. And some of these programs take a long time to build partner capacity. These governments, they need support now. And they need – so they’re – while they may be interested in some of the longer – programs that have a longer tail, I’m not sure we can wait.
So I think we got to do the long-term capacity building, but we also have to do the short-term how do we get information sharing mechanisms in place? How do we get them the intelligence they need? How can we give them some basic capabilities that will allow them to conduct their own collection activities and also to conduct their own disruption activities, with – you know, sometimes with U.S. support, sometimes allow them to do that unilaterally.
Dr. Jones: OK. One or two last questions. This one from Voice of America. And you can answer it however you want. Does the U.S. know who’s currently leading ISIS? And does this person remain in the Syria-Iraq area? Or have you seen ISIS core moving toward basing in Africa, whether in Somalia or Sahel? And reports indicate al-Qaida’s de facto leader remains based out of Iran. What does this indicate about how Tehran may still be seeking to use al-Qaida going forward?
Mr. Holmgren: Yeah. I will defer to a classified setting on the first part of the question. What was the last part on Iran?
Dr. Jones: So the question was: Reports indicate that al-Qaida still has leaders in Iran right now.
Mr. Holmgren: Yeah.
Dr. Jones: What does that – what does that suggest about how Tehran may seek – may seek to use al-Qaida in the future?
Mr. Holmgren: Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, Saif Al-Adel has been in Iran, the leader of al-Qaida. They have provided harbor –
Dr. Jones: He goes back to the Bin Laden days.
Mr. Holmgren: Yeah. He does. You know, they’ve provided harbor to al-Qaida leaders for years. So I’m not – I won’t speculate on what the Iranian intentions are, but suffice to say it is unhelpful with his presence there because he is still the de facto leader of – you know, of the al-Qaida organization.
Dr. Jones: Last question here is: Can you speak to the relationship between terrorist organizations and organized crime? How has that relationship evolved, and where do you see it headed?
Mr. Holmgren: Well, I think the – I think, you know, the Iranian-linked terrorist plotting, including against U.S. officials and against officials in other Western countries, is probably the most recent example of – groups like the Quds Force seeking to use, you know, criminal elements and surrogate networks to conduct their operations. Hezbollah has used these types of, you know, criminal networks in the past. And it’s designed to conceal and hide their activities, to try to give them some deniable cover to the operations.
And thanks to the really incredible work of the FBI over the last couple of years, where they have – working with the intel community – have uncovered Iranian efforts to do so in the United States, it has – they have not succeeded. But we know the Iranians are relentless. And they are determined to avenge the killing of Soleimani. And so that is probably the most recent example. But, again, Hezbollah has done that before. And then, of course, in the state context, you know, the Russians have played around with using criminal networks to conduct some of their own sabotage operations.
Dr. Jones: They certainly have. Last question, for the Swifties watching this, is, you know, there certainly is a concern, the way we started this, about threats to the homeland. But Americans also go to concerts overseas, as they did in Vienna for those two concerts that Taylor Swift had organized. How serious was that plot? And, you know, just basic – you know, sort of broadly speaking, I mean, what do you characterize as a success, again, of a situation like that in thwarting what appeared to be a pretty serious attack?
Mr. Holmgren: Yeah. Well, let me say as a – as a fellow Swiftie fan, I was deeply disturbed by it. But on a more serious note, it was a serious plot, and the individuals, who were arrested with – by all accounts had pledged bayat to ISIS and were inspired by ISIS, sought to kill a large number of people outside that concert venue.
Now, it should be – I would just say that, you know, concert venues have been a persistent focus for groups. We had the Bataclan concert hall in Paris in 2015. In 2017 in Manchester, England, you had the Ariana Grande concert attack, again outside the venue. And then just this past March ISIS-K’s attack on the Crocus City music hall in Moscow.
So I think the takeaway for us is they are – you know, they’re looking at large public gatherings where there – it’ll garner a lot of attention, and they’re looking for weak points in the security. And so that – but it – so that’s – for us, it’s a reminder that as – and I know DHS has done a lot of work. They had done it before, obviously, this plot emerged, but it’s a reminder – with all the different concerts and events here in the United States, that’s why there’s always such a big footprint outside our events, because we know that presence can deter. And you know, I think, you know, moving forward you’re going to see a lot more – a lot more of that.
Dr. Jones: Well, as a fellow Swiftie, thank you for the work that you, the government, our allies and partners are doing on a day-to-day basis. And as I said earlier, I don’t think most Americans have a full appreciation for how much work gets done behind closed doors for the protection of Americans both at home and overseas.
So thanks. Thanks to you and your colleagues. And if everyone here could join me in thanking Brett for a fantastic discussion. (Applause.)
Mr. Holmgren: Thank you, Seth.
Dr. Jones: Appreciate it.
Mr. Holmgren: Appreciate it. Thank you. (Applause.)

11,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/mohammad-ali-shabani-iran-after-october-7,Unknown,"November 12, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS podcast published on November 12, 2024. Listen to the podcast here.
Jon Alterman: It feels to me like everything that's happening in the Middle East now is really happening in the shadow of the attacks of October 7 of last year. From an Iranian perspective, what are the regional impacts of that attack? 
Mohammad Ali Shabani: There are vastly different viewpoints of what happened and the effects and meaning of it. From the outset, one can view the attack as heralding some kind of strategic victory for Iran in the sense that it helped preempt, or delay, at least, Israel's sought-after normalization. On the other hand, there was another camp, I think the more dominant one in Iran, which was more interested in pursuing some kind of understanding with the United States. And their key strategic aim remains to secure a semblance of sanctions relief and to put an end to the “maximum pressure” campaign that was imposed by Trump and continued by Biden in many respects.
And just before October 7, in late September, the two sides were finally moving toward really resuming some kind of negotiations, indirectly, to achieve an understanding, and then October 7 happened, which made it politically very difficult, if not toxic, for the Biden team to be perceived as dealing with Iran. 
So, there are a variety of viewpoints in Iran. Some viewed it as, at least initially, positive, others saw it kind of as a disaster in the grander scheme of things, because the big fish for them is sanctions relief. 
Jon Alterman: And it feels like the chief pressure point that Iran had was Hezbollah. And Hezbollah seems infinitely weaker now than it did a couple of months ago. People were talking about the deterrent impact of Hezbollah and 150,000 rockets and missiles trained on Israel. And Israel seems to have dismantled a lot of Hezbollah's capacity and decapitated a lot of Hezbollah's leadership. Iran has neither been able to respond effectively nor come up with an alternative. Does that also sound right to you?
Mohammad Ali Shabani: There were a lot of misperceptions over the past years. One misperception was this idea of Hezbollah and Israel being peers. Even in the months after October 7, some Lebanese analysts you would speak to had this idea of a “Beirut for Tel Aviv” formula, at least in their minds. And now we see that Hezbollah cannot directly confront a national military that, at least over the past 12 months, has received almost 23 billion U.S. dollars in aid from the United Sates, right? So, there's a disparity there. Then again, there's another viewpoint that Hezbollah is now really going back to its roots, to its origins, which is to fight an invading force. And this is where they're most comfortable. 
I was just on a conversation the other day, and they were saying how difficult it is to contact members of the organization. It's not like before. Over the past decade, with the intervention in Syria, we've seen a ballooning of Hezbollah—the size of its operations making it more vulnerable to infiltration. And Israel, what it did, was to manage successfully, as we saw in the pager operation, to carry out intelligence operations that previously were not possible, partly because when the organization was smaller—when it was operating mainly within Lebanon—it was much easier to maintain rigid standards of internal security, of vetting, et cetera. 
Those things slipped. So, with reference to Hezbollah, does it have the same capabilities it had only a few months ago? Obviously, it doesn't. Of course not. Does it serve a deterrent value for Iran? I think, yes. But this is again another misperception. And that is rooted, in the different views of war in the West versus the non-West. I saw somebody tweet something really smart about the different perceptions of war. And he was saying that Western-style warfare is shock-and-awe, and to see these images coming out and huge blows that are very visible, whereas the non-Western view of war is much more attritional.
It's about how warfare is viewed, its timeframe, the nature of it. And one of the reasons why Hezbollah has not hit back as hard as many would have expected it to is probably because its perception of the timeline of war is different from what many assume. And this is the sense that I see many analysts are now getting from the ground, that initially you had the decapitation strikes, you had the pager attacks, you had the walkie-talkie attacks, but those were kind of one-offs, right? How many times can Israel set off capabilities to injure 3,000 members of an organization in one go? 
Now that we're seeing the mounting death toll of Israel in the field, we're seeing more and more footage coming out showing that ground fighting is very different from intelligence operations, from aerial strikes, et cetera. And the sense is that Hezbollah is settling in for a long war. And in this long war, Syria, for instance, was previously a liability—it may come as an asset now because it offers Hezbollah increased strategic depth. And not just Syria, also in Iraq. Many Hezbollah families have moved to Najaf, they moved to Baghdad in recent months. 
So, the notion that Hezbollah is on the back foot is accurate. But then to go a bit deeper: does it have the capacity to, in a significant manner, attack Israel, including major urban centers? Absolutely. And that goes back, again, to the deterrent formula from the Iranian perspective.
Jon Alterman: You talked about a sort of Western concept of war, Eastern concept of war. After the Israeli strikes in Iran, the Iranian leadership seemed to advertise a Western type of war response, that Israel will feel something immediate. It felt like it was leaning more toward something on the symmetrical side, which could leave Iran in an escalation problem with Israel. Are you surprised that the Iranian leadership seems to be addressing a challenge from Israel in that sort of urgent, rapid, demonstrative way rather than taking the longer-term view that you just said is more typical of Middle Eastern and Eastern approaches?
Mohammad Ali Shabani: If you look at recent history, over just the recent decade, in Syria alone, I think Iran had absorbed hundreds of attacks, hundreds of aerial assaults. So, the IRGC absorbed these blows because they saw it as exercising strategic patience, to build up capability for that one day. The way Israel has conducted itself since October 7, shows that the previous formula, they want to change it. They want to change the rules of engagement, and Iran has been quite reticent to go along with that. Obviously, it doesn't want any other side to write the rules of engagement.
And the Israeli operations have also compelled Iran to move away from its preferred method of warfare. And in this respect, many analysts have pointed out that whereas the “axis of resistance”—the name Iran has come up with for this regional alliance network spanning from Iraq to Lebanon to Syria to Yemen—was meant to act as a forward defense to provide Iran with plausible deniability to keep the conflict outside its borders, the way Israel has conducted itself is compelling Iran to move toward this more Western shock-and-awe style of warfare. And we've seen this in operations “True Promise 1” and “True Promise 2,” when we had hundreds of ballistic missiles, drones fired at Israel. But again, they were calibrated not to kill. I think there's only been one or two casualties from both of these incidents. And they were non-combatants within Israel. 
So, now Iran is kind of stuck in this formula where it's fighting a war: number one that it doesn't want to fight; number two, in a manner it doesn't want to fight; and number three, if it doesn't fight it the way Israel does, it will be left exposed, in a difficult position both at home and before its regional alliance network. So, probably some of the conversations that are being had in Iran right now are that fighting this war—with its big displays of missile power and drone power in a direct confrontation—is probably not to Iran's benefit, for a variety of reasons that I just outlined, and also essentially because in this game, Israel has the upper hand for the same reason it has the upper hand when it comes to Hezbollah: it is backed by the world's sole superpower with its almost unlimited resources, whereas Iran is not equipped on the same level. So, then the question arises: what kind of confrontation would suit Iran better, and what can Iran do to change the nature and manner of this confrontation back to the terms it prefers?
When it comes to ground fighting, things are very different. Then, the question arises: okay, well, how can Iran engage in that? It can send forces to Lebanon to be embedded with Hezbollah, which is probably happening already. It can mobilize its regional alliance network to open up a second front in the Golan Heights in Syria. We have seen already the presence of Iraqi fighters, Yemeni fighters who have been killed in Lebanon. It's a question of how coordinated would such efforts be; to what scale would they be conducted? And has Iran made the strategic decision, which I think it has the capability to do, to turn southern Lebanon into Afghanistan for Israel?
And it hasn't decided to do so, because Iran does not want an expansion of this conflict. Everything we've seen from Iran since October 7, from the upper echelons of the leadership, is they do not want to be engaged in direct war with Israel, they do not want an expansion of the conflict in Gaza. They failed to stop it from being expanded. They certainly did not want to see the current situation in Lebanon, which has included, as you pointed out rightly, the decapitation of the organization's leadership. So, Iran is stuck with very difficult choices at present.
Jon Alterman: But it seems like Iran wants to be in a battle with a better equipped, I would argue much better trained adversary. It seemed to have, at least strategically, supported the Hamas attacks of October 7; and then to say, well, it doesn't really want to be in a war with Israel—I mean I don't understand how you can have those two things: on the one hand build up this axis of resistance, which is going to target civilians, and on the other hand say, ""can't we all just get along.""
Mohammad Ali Shabani: I see your point about the inherent dichotomy there. I think the question that needs to be asked is what is the purpose of the axis of resistance? For Iran, at least, the purpose of the axis of resistance has been forward defense to protect the homeland. There has been a lot of debate about the extent to which Iran may or may not have been involved in October 7. So far, the intelligence points to Iran not having been involved.
Jon Alterman: —Tactically. But strategically, yes, tactically, no, right?
Mohammad Ali Shabani: So, it has been involved in providing Hamas with the capabilities to attack Israel. And here we're talking specifically about things like technology transfer and training of personnel—but being involved in making a decision that ultimately has put Iran in this position, I would dispute, because I don't see October 7 as having served Iranian interests for the number one reason that I outlined previously, which is that they want sanctions relief. For them, that's the big picture. To have a single assault by Hamas doesn't really serve the core Iranian objectives. The core Iranian objective, I would argue, is to have some kind of understanding with the United States.
And I think from the Israeli perspective, at least the way things are viewed in Tehran, is that Israel views this relationship with the United States very much in zero-sum terms, that for Netanyahu, for a very long time, his main objective has been to prevent Iran-U.S. rapprochement. So, if you zoom out and you take all of these things into consideration and you ask the question, “Did Iran want October 7?” I would say absolutely not, but then as you rightly point out then you say, ""Well, hold on a second, they've been supporting Hamas all this time.""
But supporting a group doesn't mean that they can determine in minute detail these actions. The axis of resistance can be both an asset and a liability. So many are arguing now that, ""Hold on a second, this regional alliance network that you've been equipping, that you've been trying to coordinate was meant to be forward defense, to keep conflict out of your borders, out of your soil, and the exact opposite is happening right now."" This axis is actually inviting conflict toward Iran. And there's a lot of criticism of the current setup inside Iran. There's debate on the deterrent value of the axis. 
And then naturally the other question that arises is: if this regional alliance network cannot provide forward defense, what can we do to achieve primary defense? This primary defense is very limited in terms of its ability to compete again with a country that's receiving almost unlimited military and political support from the United States. The $23 billion figure that I mentioned previously, it's almost five times Israel's usual allocation of about $3.8 billion a year. 
To put that figure in perspective, that's double Iran's annual military spending—double. Iran's population is eight times that of Israel. In these terms, what can Iran plausibly do to achieve some kind of military balance? And if we have this situation with the axis not providing the forward defense that many had argued, and if we add your point about Hezbollah not providing the deterrence, there's only one natural conclusion: nuclear weapons. And this is where the discussion in Tehran is headed.
Jon Alterman: Or, arguably, a different conclusion is to end the conditions of war that have been in place between Iran and many countries, including the United States since 1979. I mean that's also an alternative.
Mohammad Ali Shabani: You have to look at things from the Iranian perspective. They are now stuck in a conflict with Israel that they do not want, and the way Netanyahu is behaving, he's doing everything he can to get this conflict. They can't stop him from pursuing this conflict. And if you're saying that Iran should change its conduct since 1979, that would mean a complete reorientation of its foreign policy aims.
Jon Alterman: As you pointed out, Iran has backed itself into a corner where it seems to be fighting, losing wars, and sanctioned, and having a weakened economy because it is committed to this zero-sum game with Israel, which has a stronger economy, the backing of the United States, and the presumption of nuclear weapons.
Mohammad Ali Shabani: My bigger point is that this notion that, ""Well, Iran could just simply eliminate this foreign policy posture, then everything will be resolved,"" I think it's more complex than that. And even if you have a successful state, less of the current ideology, you will probably end up in a similar position. 
Prior to October 7, in September 2023, there was really a push for engagement with the United States. October 7 negated that, made it far more difficult. And that was not something that was welcomed by Iran.
Jon Alterman: If Iran wants to both sustain the axis of resistance as long as it can and get closer to having a nuclear weapon because this forward defense no longer seems effective, how do you get from those two positions to anything that looks like de-escalation with the United States?
Mohammad Ali Shabani: Right now, there are a variety of camps in Iran that are pursuing different aims at the same time. This may sound very diffuse, but I'll be very specific. Keep in mind, in Iran, nuclear weapons have been taboo. The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has gone out with a so-called fatwa banning their use and stockpiling—all of those things. Now senior officials are increasingly going out and saying that we can build nuclear weapons and the reason we don't have nuclear weapons is because of a political decision, it's not a technical obstacle. 
I think they want to try to use the leverage of a threat of a bomb in a way that we haven't seen before to achieve this de-escalation. Obviously, things can backfire, and the way I see things moving is increasingly toward nuclear weapons. I don't see this happening under Khamenei though. It's probably going to happen after Khamenei, partly because of the fatwa he seems so wedded to. This is one camp.
At the same time, there's another camp still arguing that to achieve our aim, we need engagement with the West. Even amid the current escalation with Israel, even now as we speak, there are voices in Iran, including the president, including the head of the central bank and the vice president, arguing that, ""Hold on a second, our number one priority right now should be the economy."" They're talking about ways, for instance, to remove Iran from the blacklist of the FATF. They're arguing that as long as Iran is on the blacklist of the Financial Action Task Force, it's not just about Western sanctions making it basically impossible to engage in any kind of meaningful commercial trade relationship with Western countries, it's also making it very difficult for Iran to engage with China and Russia.
There are many experts who are in the industry in Iran, who argue that one of the main obstacles to trade with China is FATF. So, these are not mutually exclusive processes. There are different camps in Iran that are pushing and pulling to go in different directions, and there are even some who are trying to thread the needle by having these debates about nuclear weapons being made increasingly public and going out and saying that the main obstacle to a nuclear weapon is it's not technical, it's a political decision. 
In this respect, I should also point out that the camp that is not in favor of nuclear weapons argues that by pursuing such capabilities, essentially a nuclear arms race will be initiated in the region, and at the end of that arms race what will happen is that Iran will, through the nuclearization of the Middle East, lose the advantages inherent in its geography and its demography, et cetera. 
There are a variety of viewpoints, but your point about how you compute the diverging tendencies right now, one in favor of weaponization of the nuclear program, looking at the region, looking at the axis, looking at forward defense, and on the other hand, seeking kind of de-escalation. It's very difficult.
Jon Alterman: Where do you see power devolving in Iran? The Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei is 85, although he seems to be in relatively robust health, he's still 85. One hears increasingly about the Revolutionary Guard emerging as a sort of Praetorian guard taking power, the clerical establishment diminishing in influence. If that happens, does that create a moment of flexibility? Is there a more transactional leadership, that Iran becomes less ideological, more interest-based?
Or, in your sense, does the Revolutionary Guard have its own ideology, relatively consistent—and I would imagine some people think that Iran with a stronger Revolutionary Guard voice in leadership would actually be more combative because of its ties through the Quds Force to all sorts of axis resistance movements throughout the region. If we look at a five-year horizon, what do you think we should be looking for in terms of foreign policy direction and how power is distributed in Iran?
Mohammad Ali Shabani: The question of leadership succession is always looming large. Of course, the million-dollar question is what happens when Khamenei goes? Nobody really has an answer to that. Procedurally, we do have some insight into how leadership succession is meant to work, but nobody really knows the details, nobody knows the list of names. 
There are a variety of ways that Iran can move forward. One aspect could be that simply another leader is named, and those who go down that route argue that it is either going to be a strong leader, somewhat similar to what we have now, or that the Revolutionary Guard—and I would caution the notion of the IRGC being a monolith, but still, let's say the Revolutionary Guard is a somewhat coherent entity—would prefer somebody weak. A weak leader who is more easily influenced, more easily managed. That’s the argument about replicating what we’ve seen so far since 1979, which is to have a single Supreme Leader. 
Another argument that’s been made repeatedly over the past 20 years is to change the institution of the guardian jurist, the Vilayat-e Faqih, and turn it into a council. And when you turn it into a council, then the question is, who’s going to be part of that council? Which political faction will be represented? There’s even talk about, “Well, hold on. Maybe existing institutions can be reformed,” right? So, let’s say the Supreme National Security Council, the current top decision-making council, which gathers the country’s civilian and military leadership—can that be reformed in some kind of way to be turned into a leadership council, right? 
So, then the argument could be that if you go with a council model, you will have more stability because, obviously, there are more decision-makers involved. You become more impervious to any high-profile assassination attempt, et cetera.
But if you zoom out even more and we look at the bigger picture here, at what direction is Iran really moving? And this goes back to what I argued previously. I understand this notion that Iran under the monarchy was fundamentally completely different. I would argue that if you look at the real underlying core aims of Iran in the region, on the surface the ideology may seem different, but I think the interests haven’t really changed. And some people in Iran see Iran going full circle. 
So, what did we have under the Shah? It was a secular government, a secular state, basically pursuing a form of nationalism with a Muslim identity. What we’re seeing in Iran is kind of a return to that, where the state is more nationalist and less interfering in people’s personal lives when it comes to things like religion. So, let me give you an anecdote. 
At least in Tehran, in the capital, based on what I’m hearing, in the past two months or so the state has completely given up on hijab enforcement. It’s gone. It’s mind-blowing that people, they ditched the veil, walking out with crop tops, at least in northern Tehran, and the so-called “guidance patrol” are doing nothing. Outside Tehran is a different question. And for me, at least, these scenes are shocking because I’ve seen the amount of resources they put into things like hijab enforcement. 
So, if the state is moving toward increasing nationalist predisposition, if they’re moving toward less enforcement of religious affairs, private religious affairs, we’re really going back to the Shah’s era. What I mean by nationalist predisposition is that in Iran increasingly, we have what they call an Iranian-Islamic identity. That Iran is seen as distinguished from other Muslim states. That there’s a very strong nationalist, pro-Persian component to it, Shia component. At the same time, you know, there is an Islamist nature to the state ideology, and they’re trying to find a different way. How will this spell out in terms of foreign policy orientation? 
I think, if they can find a way to coexist with other major powers and then negotiate, at least informal understandings that allow them to expend more of their energy within the country’s borders, that’s a win-win for everybody. Do I foresee post-Khamenei Iran signing a grand peace deal with Israel? No, probably not. But does Israel want that? Does Israel need that? I think not, probably. They’re happy living with some kind of cold peace. A kind of understanding that this is our domain, this is your domain, and we’re going to find a way to not be at each other’s throats.
Jon Alterman: As a final question, let me ask about the Israel question, the regional question. Regional states seem to be simultaneously exploring closer ties with Israel, at least in the medium and long-term, and some sort of reduction in tensions with Iran. We saw Saudi Arabia doing naval exercises with Iran, which is mind-blowing. Is this a sustainable trend? Is this a trend that Iran actually wants to encourage, as some of your comments might suggest? Or does this just represent hedging on the part of Gulf States who are hedging between Iran and Israel, between the United States and China and Russia? Is this just one big hedge?
Mohammad Ali Shabani: Many see Saudi Arabia's maneuvering toward normalization with Israel in the context of normalization with Iran, and the conclusion they are drawing is that Muhammad bin Salman calculated that to be able to normalize with Israel, he first needs to normalize with Iran. So, they see what you're saying, an element of hedging. 
There's also an understanding of MBS as being, in many ways, an inward-looking actor. Somebody who's, again, a nationalist leader. Who has a number one priority, and that priority is Vision 2030. And at any expense, he will pursue it because he sees it as vital to the interest of the Kingdom and its future. And this is why he's become much more flexible in Yemen, where he's willing to live with the Houthis, he’s willing to live with Iran. With reference to how Iran views these developments, as I said previously, there was a camp in Iran that viewed October 7, at least initially, as a win because it prevented Saudi-Israel normalization, which was viewed as very negative. But there are also other camps in Iran, which see the bigger fish being some kind of understanding with the United States, that they see sanctions relief as the number one objective. 
So, zooming out again and asking your core question here, “How does Iran view the kind of Arab-Israel normalization process? The longer-term trend in the coming years?” I think they do see Saudi Arabia moving toward some form of understanding with Israel, but they see normalization with Iran as a prerequisite for that. So, it's not going to be a net loss for Iran. 
They see the Gulf countries feeling exactly as you pointed out, stuck trying to hedge between the major powers—Russia, China, and the United States. They also see Turkey, they see Iran, they see Israel. And I think one, for at least the Saudis, one really key moment that shaped a lot of their current behavior is what happened in September 2019, when the oil facilities came under attack. And this notion that the United States was committed to Saudi security, they would rush in and help, it didn’t materialize, and they were stuck on their own.
Jon Alterman: And that was, of course, an Iranian attack on Saudi Arabia, which Iran initially denied and said it was the Houthis.
Mohammad Ali Shabani: They denied (laughs). There's a dispute about where the missiles were actually even fired from. The point there being that the U.S. security commitment didn’t, you know, materialize. So, that’s just partly why they now want to have stronger commitments to the defense of the kingdom. The point being that they see these chips moving, and they see a lot of hedging, as you rightly point out. But I think they also understand that there’s a realization among the Gulf countries that they can’t change their geography. That even though they may not like Iran and its current state, its political system, they have to find a way to coexist with it. 
And I think one pioneer in this regard has been the UAE. When Trump left the nuclear deal, the Iran nuclear deal, in 2018, they cheered him on. Three years later, they’re among the first in the GCC to reach out to Tehran, and the United States followed. So, I think there’s an aspect of hedging, but I think really there’s also a different understanding of regional dynamics and the limits of U.S. commitment. And this changes things a lot because they understand the United States is not going to be there forever. 
From their perspective, I think for anybody’s perspective, if you look at things rationally, there’s not really much in the Middle East for the United States. The number one priority for the United States has always been China. That’s the peer competitor. If you look at the region, there are not really crucial, core U.S. interests there. Right now, even oil— even people who keep being stuck on oil— the United States is now the net oil exporter. The main export of Saudi Arabia is the oil price. So, I think the calculations in the region are changing.
Jon Alterman: Mohamad Ali Shabani, thank you very much for joining us on Babel.
Mohammad Ali Shabani: Thank you for having me.

National Guard troops opened fire, killing one. In western France, saboteurs uprooted underground water pipes and activists armed with improvised explosives repeatedly battled police. Hundreds have been injured in massive demonstrations opposing irrigation projects said to favor industrial producers over small farmers. In Cameroon, clashes pitting Musgum fisher communities against ethnic Arab Choa herders over access to water points left dozens dead. Thousands of refugees have fled across the Chari River into neighboring Chad.
Water-related conflicts are increasing worldwide. Why are water tensions growing? What forms do emerging water conflicts take? And how can they be prevented?
A Rising Tide of Water Conflict
The Pacific Institute, a California-based think tank, maintains the most comprehensive available database tracking the global litany of violence. The Water Conflict Chronology now catalogs over 1900 instances of armed violence associated with water resources and water systems, dating back to antiquity. Nearly 90 percent of all recorded entries have occurred since the start of the twenty-first century. Conflict events around the world have risen markedly in recent years. The period 2012–2021 witnessed roughly four times more conflicts than the years 2000–2011. In 2023, violent incidents soared 50 percent over the number in 2022, while 2022 had endured almost twice as many conflict cases as the year before. International water conflict in particular has surged. For most of the twentieth century, water collaboration between states substantially outweighed discord. Scholars at Oregon State University, combing through the archives of international relations, identified over 2,500 interstate events concerning water between 1948 and 2008. Cooperative international interactions, they discovered, outnumbered conflicts two to one. But this trend no longer seems to hold. A new dataset carrying the analysis up to 2019 reveals the conflict-cooperation balance has shifted over the past two decades. Since 2017, transboundary water clashes have overtaken acts of international collaboration.
Much of this rising tide of violence reflects the grim toll of twenty-first-century warfare. All too often, wars make water a deliberate tool or a collateral casualty of conflict. From the grinding civil strife in Iraq and Syria to Russia’s assault on Ukraine, combatants have purposely targeted water resources, seizing or destroying water systems as leverage against their adversaries. Similarly, Israel’s prosecution of the war on Hamas and Russia’s brutal invasion have severely compromised water sources, degraded ecosystems, and decimated water infrastructure, imperiling public health and welfare in Gaza and Ukraine.
Water as a Conflict Catalyst
While water frequently figures as a weapon or victim of war, it also increasingly constitutes a contributing trigger of conflict as competing users assert their claims to vital resources. Rising water demands, escalating environmental pressures, and unsustainable management practices increasingly strain global water supplies. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development projects that global water withdrawals will climb 55 percent by 2050 from 2000 levels, propelled by mounting needs for industry, energy production, and domestic use. The United Nations calculates world agricultural production will have to ramp up 50 percent by mid-century to feed a growing population, requiring water withdrawals 30 percent higher than today. Yet many major river basins and groundwater aquifers have reached or surpassed the limits of their renewable resources. One recent global assessment found that 2–3 billion people live in regions where total net water withdrawals outstrip locally available renewable supplies for up to half the year. For half a billion people, net demand outpaces supply all year round. The increasing frequency and severity of floods, droughts, and water-related extreme weather events further aggravate societal vulnerabilities and water security risks.
Many observers fear such figures could portend potentially wrenching collisions between growing water needs and available water supplies. Where different countries or communities rely on the same water sources, shortfalls between rising demands and diminishing availability could provoke sharpened competition or even violent conflict to secure scarce resources. Few analysts, though, argue that water stress or environmental shocks directly cause conflict. Rather, a range of indirect factors, such as the weight of water-dependent sectors in the economy and the presence and distribution of coping capacities shape the nature and extent of the impacts on society. Water stresses interact with contextual elements such as power asymmetries, ineffective governance, and economic inequalities to create combinations of circumstances that may catalyze conflict.
Identifying Water Conflict Pathways
Water conflicts can arise from different combinations of contributing factors forming distinct causal pathways. Clarifying the specific actors, mechanisms, and contexts involved in different types of water conflicts can enhance our understanding of how particular water-related security risks can arise and unfold.
The United Nations defines water security as:
""The capacity of a population to safeguard sustainable access to adequate quantities of acceptable quality water for sustaining livelihoods, human well-being, and socio-economic development, for ensuring protection against water-borne pollution and water-related disasters, and for preserving ecosystems in a climate of peace and political stability.""
Water conflicts may take forms and follow dynamics implicating any of the constituent elements of water security—water access; available water quantity or quality; livelihoods and development; water-related disasters; and political processes.
Environmental pressures on shared water resources: Varying precipitation patterns, changes in snow and ice melt, or saline intrusion into groundwater aquifers can alter or disrupt the quantity, quality, or timing of available water resources, potentially engendering or exacerbating competition between contending water users. Across the Sahel, droughts and diminished rainfall have shifted the range and growing conditions for crops and grasses, pushing seminomadic herders seeking pasture to graze their livestock onto the lands of sedentary farmers. Local farmer-herder confrontations over land tenure, use rights, and access to watering points periodically escalate into violent intercommunal clashes that may threaten broader instability.
Changing user demands: Significant changes in the size, location, timing, or nature of water use—or claims from new users—can strain available renewable resources, creating tensions between consumers. Intensifying petroleum exploitation in Nigeria’s coastal Niger River Delta dramatically degraded the region’s water quality, poisoning streams, groundwater, fisheries, and fields. Ethnic rebel groups regularly decry the Delta’s contamination among the reasons for their attacks on international oil company operations and violence against the state.
Water disasters: Floods, droughts, and water-related catastrophes imperil lives and livelihoods. They can drive significant economic damage, population displacements, and social distress. Where government disaster responses prove inadequate or inequitable (or are perceived so), the state’s failure to ensure public welfare can erode social cohesion and stoke armed conflict risks. In 1970 Cyclone Bhola devastated the territory then known as East Pakistan. Perhaps half a million people perished. The feeble and discriminatory response by the central government in West Pakistan galvanized dissidence in the East, helping trigger a secessionist crisis that culminated in the bloody civil war that created independent Bangladesh.
Construction and operation of Infrastructure on a shared waterway: Building and operating infrastructure such as hydropower dams and irrigation schemes can impact water flows downstream, affecting other water uses and users up and down the river. Since the 1970s, upstream Turkey has developed massive infrastructure programs in the Tigris-Euphrates Basin. Blaming Turkish dams for decreasing water supplies, downstream Syria supported the Kurdistan Workers Party insurgency against Ankara as an armed proxy to counter Turkey’s alleged manipulations of the Euphrates River’s flow, precipitating serial military showdowns over the ensuing decades.
Water services provision: The ability of civil authorities to furnish water and sanitation services constitutes an important building block of state “performance legitimacy.” Government failure to supply this public good (on acceptable terms) can spur popular discontent. In 1999, Bolivia privatized the municipal water company in the city of Cochabamba. Fearing expropriation of their communal water systems and abrogation of customary water rights, residents and farmers launched a wave of strikes and blockades. Bolivia’s “water wars” saw the government declare a state of siege before ultimately returning the utility to public management.
Resource expropriation and access to decisionmaking: In many places, water rights and decisionmaking processes can be ill-defined, exclusionary, or subject to arbitrary control. Government or economic elites may undertake infrastructure projects, implement management policies, or expropriate water resources or benefits without the effective participation or consultation of relevant stakeholders. In India, Maoist rebels known as “Naxalites” operate across the country’s central and eastern states. Largely subsistence farmers and landless laborers, they depend on collectively held land and waters for their survival needs. Indian government analyses have concluded that development-induced displacement and systematic dispossession of vulnerable populations from common property resources are fueling the insurgency.
Water and border disputes: Water bodies are often used to demarcate political boundaries. Rivers, for example, define over one-third of international land borders by length. Consequently, changes in the shape or course of waterways can spawn territorial disputes. Straddling the frontiers of Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria, Lake Chad has shrunk 90 percent since the 1960s due to decreasing rainfall and increasing water withdrawals from rivers feeding into it. Farmers, fishers, and herders following the receding shoreline across international borderlines have clashed with border security forces, and deadly confrontations have erupted over the ownership of islands emerging from the lake as water levels fall.
Water as a tool or target of war: Water resources and infrastructure may be targeted by parties to violent conflict. Capture or destruction of water sources and infrastructure may be used as weapons of war to control territory or populations. During the civil war in Iraq, ISIS seized control of dams in Fallujah, Mosul, Ramadi, and elsewhere and used them to either flood or cut off water supplies to Shiite and government-held areas.
 In practice, multiple water conflict pathways may interact. The development of water infrastructure may enable resource expropriation. Exclusionary decisionmaking may contribute to disaster risks. Water disputes may ramify into clashes over arable land, productive fisheries, or other goods that water sustains. Armed conflicts can in turn degrade resource bases, erode social cohesion, and undermine coping capacities, perpetuating self-reinforcing cycles of fragility, grievance, and violence. Yet water conflicts can evolve dynamically over time, oscillating between elements of collaboration and confrontation. Conflict and cooperation can and do often coexist.
Political institutions, economic conditions, technical capacities, material resources, and social perceptions shape how communities apprehend and address water resource challenges, mediating between water insecurity and conflict risks. Importantly, water conflict dynamics frequently revolve not around environmental changes and resource pressures but around governance policies and practices. Management choices about shared resources may engender water “security dilemmas.” Measures taken by one community to enhance its own water security—constructing a dam to increase water storage capacity, for instance—may undermine the water security of others by shifting the control of water resources and the nature of water risks. Likewise, inequitable allocation of the costs and benefits of water development and inadequate access to decisionmaking procedures around shared waters can loom larger in generating conflict than unequal allocation or inadequate access to the physical resource itself. From Swords to Ploughshares
Policymakers from the United States and the European Union to NATO and the UN Security Council consider that water challenges could contribute to destabilizing key countries, drive population displacements, aggravate social disruptions in fragile states, and endanger global peace and prosperity. The World Economic Forum regularly ranks water-related risks among the most likely and most impactful global threats of the coming decades. And new risk factors are emerging. As water stresses grow more acute, the U.S. Intelligence Community envisages some states in shared basins may use the control of water supplies via dams and other infrastructure to exercise leverage over other riparian countries. Such veiled coercion by an upstream power of a downstream neighbor could prove as disruptive as overt violence.
Strengthening our understanding of water-related conflict risk can help illuminate the key dynamics of contemporary water security challenges. Clearly specifying the drivers of different conflict pathways can contribute to developing “early warning” indicators for emerging risks and to formulating appropriate conflict reduction approaches. Similarly, elucidating how distinct conflict pathways may unfold can help target vulnerabilities and pinpoint entryways for bolstering water governance processes and institutions to mitigate water security risks. Finally, in conflict-affected countries, clarifying different conflict types can help craft targeted peacebuilding strategies and prevent conflict recurrence in post-conflict environments.

Ms. Bradsher: It is. Thank you. It’s wonderful to be here.
Ms. Ali: So what did 10-year-old Tanya Bradsher want to be when she grew up?
Ms. Bradsher: (Laughs.) She really just wanted to play. She was a pretty rough and tumble tomboy. She was in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, now Camp – Fort Liberty. And, you know, her dad was a mess sergeant. And she just ran around, played hard, and was always home by the streetlights. That was my rule from my parents.
Ms. Ali: She just wanted to have a good time.
Ms. Bradsher: Have a good time. Had no idea.
Ms. Ali: And I love this picture of you, because it also says on your T-shirt, “felt happy today, just want to have a good time,” but also it looks like an official headshot. So you were headed towards big things very early on.
Ms. Bradsher: (Laughs.) Well, what’s funny, this sticker – my mom hates this sticker. It is from a Crackerjacks box. And I put it on my shirt without her knowing about it, until the school photo came back. And she just was so upset. She’s like, you’ve ruined the picture. I can’t believe you have that on there. But I kind of like it.
Ms. Ali: Well, I think it looks absolutely great. So you didn’t have any – you didn’t know if you wanted to work in a certain industry or sector. That wasn’t something that you were thinking were thinking about at that time?
Ms. Bradsher: Especially at that age, no. I just – you know, it was all about going out, going go play. And later on in life I thought maybe I wanted to be a schoolteacher. And so that was kind of my first piece in high school. And then I ran summer camp and realized I probably should not be a schoolteacher.
Ms. Ali: (Laughs.) It’s a tough job. It’s underappreciated and underpaid.
Ms. Bradsher: Absolutely, yes.
Ms. Ali: Well, you come from a family with four generations of military service. And we have a wonderful picture of your grandfather here. Could you tell us a little bit more about what this photo represents?
Ms. Bradsher: Yes. Oh, this tears me up. So the gentleman, if you look from the left three in, is my grandfather, Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Curry is my mother’s father. I’m biracial. My mom is White. My dad is Black. And he was the conductor of the Army Band – the longest serving conductor of the Army Band from 1948 to 1964. And he is from Massachusetts, Boston. And so for him, it was a wonderful privilege to be able to be in the room with President Kennedy. And one of my grandfather’s last acts on active duty was being the band conductor of Pershing’s Own for Kennedy’s funeral. And that devastated him. It really was quite hard for him. But he has a wonderful legacy within the United States Army Band. And they don’t have a lot of conductors. I can’t remember how many they have, but I do know he is the longest serving conductor of Pershing’s Own.
Ms. Ali: Oh, wow. That’s incredible. Well, talk to me a little bit more about your family’s military legacy and how that’s shaped you, and who you are today.
Ms. Bradsher: Absolutely. I’ve always either lived around or on a military base. My father was drafted for Vietnam when I was one year old and ended up not going to Vietnam. And so he went straight to, at the time, Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and served 11 consecutive years. Ended up jumping all 11 years, blowing at his knee, and was then sent to Germany. And when he went to Germany, we moved back to Arlington, Virginia, which is where I was born. And that’s where I went to junior high and high school. And then we lived with my grandfather, who you just saw, my mom’s parents. And so we always had big band photos, and photos of he and my grandmother, and his time in service. So I’ve always been around the military.
Ms. Ali: And what are some of the values, do you think, that that instilled in you very early on?
Ms. Bradsher: I think being a public servant. Always wanting to serve. Huge respect for the military, for the – you know, Army was what I was exposed to for the vast majority of my life. And that, you know, enlisted and officer, because my dad was enlisted and my grandfather was an officer. And just always being someone who would do the right thing, and who would always – never sit back in a situation, just always willing to help. That was what my dad did. It’s what my grandfather did. It’s just what I saw growing up.
Ms. Ali: And you yourself turned to military service as well, and at a difficult time in your life. Could you tell us how much of a defining moment that was to make that decision?
Ms. Bradsher: (Laughs.) So what happened was I wasn’t planning on joining the Army. I had went to college. I went to University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. But when I graduated my parents got divorced. And that was a really hard time. My dad had retired from the Army. And from there I had met a guy and ended up kind of getting married really quick, and really searching for a sense of family. And turns out that that didn’t really work out well. So one day my mom said, let’s go to lunch. And I said, OK. So we – I got in her car and she drove me straight to the recruiters.
And I’m sitting outside.
Ms. Ali: She made the decision.
Ms. Bradsher: And I’m looking – I’m looking for the restaurant. And all I see is the recruiters. (Laughter.) And I said, what’s going on? And she said, you’re going to go in. You’re going to go talk to a recruiter. And you’re going to sign up for Officer Candidate School because the life you are living is not why your dad and I sent you – sent you to college. And so I went in, and, you know, went through the process. And the guy really wanted me to enlist immediately. And I said, no, I wanted to go to OCS. And so another gentleman, Sergeant First Class Johnson, ended up calling me that night and said, hey, I’m getting ready to take over a different station. I will process your OCS packet, but I just ask that you don’t waste my time. And that started my journey. And so I went to basic training at Fort Jackson, and then Officer Candidate School at Fort Benning.
Ms. Ali: So your mom wanted to give you a sense of purpose with that decision?
Ms. Bradsher: Yes. My mom knew – she saw in me what I didn’t see in myself at the time. She knew that I was not on a great path, and that really the Army would be good for me. And what was fascinating to me that I did not anticipate was I went to basic training, and when I got to basic training the same bunk beds that my dad brought home and painted pink and – pink for me and green for my brother, were the exact same bunk beds at Fort Jackson. And so I walked in and I was like, oh, top bunk. And I got in trouble – (laughs) – because I spoke. But the other piece was I really felt at home in basic training. And I didn’t think at the time it’d be a career, but I knew it was exactly where I needed to be at that point in my life.
Ms. Ali: Yeah. You said something very important, she saw in you what you didn’t see in yourself. And just before this, we were talking about this idea of imposter, right, and the importance of having people around you – whether that’s family, or mentors, or colleagues – that can push you and see your potential.
Ms. Bradsher: Yes. I have been blessed with mentors and colleagues throughout my entire life, even up until the role that I’m currently in, who have said, you know, I think you can – you can do this, and had that confidence. And I’ve had to use their confidence to get me over that hurdle
Ms. Ali: Now, you’re in the military. One of the challenges that you face is being part of a dual military household. Can you explain to us what a dual military household means?
Ms. Bradsher: Absolutely. So I’ll just go ahead and say that I first – divorced my first husband, and then I went to Korea as my first assignment as a second lieutenant, and I met John Bradsher, who was a captain.
Ms. Ali: And we have a great picture of you and John as well.
Ms. Bradsher: Oh! (Laughs.)
Ms. Ali: Where is picture from?
Ms. Bradsher: OK, so this picture is from Iraq. This is Baghdad. And so what’s really unique about this is I’m actually not deployed at the time. I am with Secretary Gates, traveling with him on his last trip to Iraq. John is actually stationed – or, deployed to Iraq in Baghdad, and was actually working for General Austin, who’s now the secretary of defense. And during that trip, I was able to see him for a day because we were at the same location. And so the gentleman who took this photo is actually the secretary of defense’s photographer, who was so excited that, you know, seeing John and I back together. And said, oh, let’s take some pictures. And it looks really magical, but it’s in Baghdad. (Laughs.) Believe it or not. As you can tell, my husband has a weapon on, so –
Ms. Ali: I didn’t actually notice that until you pointed it out.
Ms. Bradsher: Yeah. Yeah.
Ms. Ali: But it’s a great picture.
Ms. Bradsher: Thank you.
Ms. Ali: So you were saying that –
Ms. Bradsher: Oh, so we were – so we got married, and pretty soon started our family. So we have three girls. And the challenge, John’s five years older than me and senior to me in the military. And so wanting to make sure that we’re stationed in the same location, that we could keep our family together, was definitely a little easier when we were lower rank. And then as we got more and more senior, it got more complicated. And as our girls got older, you know, our girls wanted stability, because we had lived in Korea, we had lived in Colorado, we had lived in D.C. And once we got to D.C., all three of them came home and said, we’re not going anywhere. And so that was actually when I thought, OK, maybe it’s time for me to go ahead and retire, and that way John can continue.
Ms. Ali: I think maybe those are the moments where perhaps we realize it’s OK to say no, it’s OK to say enough, and thinking about what the priorities are.
Ms. Bradsher: Absolutely. You know, as a parent – and I think sometimes even in today’s society – you know, as a mom, wanting to make sure that stability was so vital. And John I knew really thoroughly enjoyed the Army. And I did as well. But when it came to, OK, who’s going to be the one, I knew it would be better if I went ahead and retired.
Ms. Ali: You said you have three daughters.
Ms. Bradsher: I do.
Ms. Ali: Are you secretly hoping for a fifth generation of –
Ms. Bradsher: I would love that. But, you know, it’s their determination. I think, you know, if one of my daughters decided to join the military, I would be so excited. But they are continuing – I have one right now who is working cybersecurity for the government. And so they are continuing public service. So I feel very proud for that. And I have one who’s going to graduate college in May. And my youngest will graduate high school in June. So there’s still hope.
Ms. Ali: Yeah. Lots of great accomplishments, regardless.
Ms. Bradsher: Thanks.
Ms. Ali: You were also stationed at the Pentagon during 9/11. Could you share with us what was that day like? What happened?
Ms. Bradsher: Absolutely. So when I first arrived to the Pentagon, it was July of 2001. I was a joint staff intern. So I was really junior to be there. I was a captain. And I found out in August I was pregnant with my second daughter. And so, you know, up until September 10th, my days are pretty great. It was 8:00 a.m. to 4:30, and I was going to the gym, and I had time for lunch, and I was doing the intern program. And then the morning of 9/11, it was absolutely beautiful. It was a Carolina blue sky. And we had started the day pretty – you know, very regular.
And the first tower was hit. And then the second tower was hit. And we knew something was wrong. And I vividly remember a woman who was carrying her shoes and running down the corridor of the Pentagon screaming, get out of my way, get out of my way. And then all of a sudden, the alarms went off, and it was time to evacuate. And we were very hesitant to evacuate, because on Friday before 9/11 we actually evacuated the Pentagon because somebody had, like, dried mats or something inside a dryer, and it had toxic fumes – or, nauseous fumes. And so we knew we were under attack, and didn’t want to leave. But we did.
And so we’re all, like, talking and, like, leaving the Pentagon, and a little frustrated. And as we go outside, we see the dark, black plume. And that was our sign something was wrong. And then we all got real quiet. And we exited and went to the side of the sidewalk. And I remember hearing jets go over. And an Air Force general officer – and I only knew that because of the braid on his hat said, “our boys are in the air.” We have air – we control the air. And our flip phones – right? It’s not 2001 – didn’t work.
And we saw just the really dark, black smoke over the Pentagon. And we couldn’t – it was actually under construction. And so the section – a large portion of the Pentagon that was hit was actually supposed to open 1 October. And my husband was supposed to move in on 1 October. He was in a building in Crystal City. And so I – we saw the black plume. And then the floors crashed. They crashed 22 minutes after the plane was hit. And so when the floors crashed, we thought that was a second explosion. And that is actually when we left the building and left the Pentagon.
And so I walked over to Crystal City. And I had no idea – it’s kind of embarrassing – but I didn’t actually know where John worked. I knew he worked in Crystal City, but I just didn’t know which building, because I knew, like, you know, in a couple of months he was going to be back in the building. And so I called him at a glass – an eyeglass store, and told him where I was. And we decided we would meet at Hamburger Hamlet. And I was standing waiting for him to come get me, and that’s when I found out that the towers had fallen, because we had been in transit. And just the devastation.
And, of course, initially for the Pentagon we thought a lot more people had been – were killed. And so we just waited. And so I met with him. And then I went home. And then Wednesday, the 12th, we went back in the building, and it was still on fire. The fire department was still putting out the fire on the roof. And we just, you know, went back in. And we’ve been, you know, to me, working ever since. And that just – that pivot of, you know, I went on 12-hour shifts. I went on – John went on shifts. He went it back – actually, the night of 9/11 he spent the night in the Pentagon because he became a watch officer. And he went to the Army Operations Center.
And on the 12th, I went to work – I was a joint staff intern. And my boss, Captain McCreary, went from person to person and gave him their assignments. And he got to me, and he said: You’re a trained public affairs – you’re a trained public affairs officer with a TS/SCI clearance. That intern blank is over. And you have a shift in the NMCC. And so with that, I went on shift with everyone else. And I worked days. John worked nights. And so we did not see each other, because we kind of hot bunked – we only had one kid at the time. And I went – October 7th was the – I went to day shift to night shift. And that was our first meal together. And we had pancakes in the Pentagon gym at 2:00 a.m.
And from there, a few weeks after that, I really started kind of filling out with my pregnancy. (Laughs.) And I called Captain McCreary to update him on something else and told him that I probably was going to have to shift to my maternity clothes. And he didn’t realize I was pregnant. Everyone just thought I was gaining weight. And so I ended up coming off night shift and going back to – but still on day shift. And so did that all the way until I had Catherine.
Ms. Ali: Wow. Wow. I cannot imagine how hard it was to also, in the middle of all this going on, not being able to see – to see family. And I’m sure finding ways to get additional support.
Ms. Bradsher: Yeah. I mean, the blessing that we had – and she’s a constant theme – is my mom. You know, during that time she pretty much just helped us with transitioning for Charlotte. And she adjusted her work schedule to be able to assist us so that we could work pretty much, you know, 24 hours.
Ms. Ali: Now, as you know, we ask all of our guests to bring a memento, something that symbolizes a meaningful moment in their career. Could you please describe to us what you’ve brought here, and why did you decide to bring it?
Ms. Bradsher: Absolutely. So it’s very easy when you’ve served in the Army for any amount of time, because you get lots of mementos. And so I didn’t want to clutter my office with a whole bunch. And this was the one that I chose. This was my farewell gift when I left Fort Carson after our deployment to Iraq. And it’s handmade. It was handmade by one of the sergeant majors who is a master woodworker. And I just love it. I think the craftsmanship of it, it’s a great reminder of my deployment, as well as my service in the Army. And so it’s the one thing that I have in my office.
Ms. Ali: It’s wonderful. And I didn’t know until you shared that it’s handmade.
Ms. Bradsher: Yes.
Ms. Ali: Yeah.
Ms. Bradsher: Yeah.
Ms. Ali: Very, very beautiful piece. And, like you said, it symbolizes your service.
Ms. Bradsher: Exactly, and the time, you know, being a proud member of 4ID, 2nd Brigade. And, you know, it was also a challenging time. But I’m very proud of my service.
Ms. Ali: So let’s talk post your service. So you retired as a lieutenant colonel in 2013. You worked in the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, the White House. I could go on and on. What challenges did you face transitioning to civilian government career?
Ms. Bradsher: So I had a really weird and kind of unique situation. My last two years I was actually detailed to the White House. I was at the National Security Council. I was doing public affairs there. I was a public affairs officer in the Army, and so I did that at the Pentagon and then I went to NSC, where I got to wear civilian clothes, grow my hair out, and met the deputy national security advisor, a gentleman by the name of Denis McDonough. And really just thought that I would, you know, stay there. And then decided, after the first year, that it was time for me to take a look at retiring. That, you know, retiring out of NSC would be a great opportunity to whatever my life was after that.
And I ended up sending out resumes, applying for jobs. And one day had two interviews on the same day. And the first interview was with Valerie Jarrett to work in the Office of Public Engagement for Military Families, Wounded Warriors, and Veterans. And another one was to be a spokesman on the Hill, one of the committees. And so I went to the first interview. And I had my two phones, and my green book, and I tripped over the tread at her door – like, tripped hard. And I was mortified. And I stand up, and she’s standing there with her hand out. And I shake her hand. And she says, this will be the easiest job interview you’ve ever had. Everyone I love loves you. We’d like to welcome you to the team.
And so I took the job right then and there. And didn’t ask salary. Didn’t ask anything. Just was so excited. And what that ended up turning into is I became a political appointee, because I joined the Obama administration. And so it was an incredible honor and a privilege. But I really didn’t fully comprehend what it all meant. I was just super excited to continue to work at the White House and to be able to support the president.
Ms. Ali: So let’s now talk about your leadership at the – at the VA. You said that reaching out to female veterans was a priority of yours. Could you share why you decided to focus on that particularly, and what you’ve been able – under your leadership – to do so far?
Ms. Bradsher: While we were – you know, the PACT Act was signed in 2022. And we did a heck of a lot of outreach to be able to highlight the fact that we wanted our veterans to sign up. So we all went out, fanned out, and did different engagements across the board. And what I found was for women veterans, they would come up to me and ask about their spouse. And, you know, he did 20 years. We want to make sure he gets everything. And so as we were talking I would ask, you know, how’d you guys meet? Oh, we were stationed together. Oh, so you served. Why aren’t you also applying?
And it was, I only did four years. I got out when I was pregnant. And there was this compartmentalizing and minimizing of their service because they didn’t serve as long or they didn’t do as many tours. And the other engagement that I’ve had, it was at Target on Veterans Day. We had a young lady. She opened up the line for veterans. And so we’re standing in line, and when I came up to my turn I said: Thank you so much. It’s wonderful that – you know, for you to do this. And she said, I used to be a veteran. And it’s not a club you leave. (Laughs.) So I said, what do you mean? And, of course, I’ve got this whole line behind me. I said, what do you mean, you used to be a veteran?
And she said, well, I only did one deployment, and I only served four years. I used to be a veteran. And I said, no, you’re always a veteran. Have you signed up for your benefits? And she said, no, no, I only did one tour. I was like, absolutely you deserve your benefits. So you need to sign up. And so what I hope, being the first woman to be confirmed to serve – we’ve had a couple of acting females but never one confirmed – that other women veterans see me and see that the VA is for them. And I hope – because I, you know, get invited to do some women’s history events in March that I was able to do. I went to Nevada. I went to Arkansas. That women veterans take the opportunity to learn about the amazing services that VA has for them.
We have really just phenomenal reproductive care. We have women’s health. We have women’s clinics. We have really done so much to be able to reach out to our women veterans, including menopause which in the last year we finally can say out loud. I’m not really sure what happened, but it’s nice to be able to talk about menopause. And wanting to make sure that our women veterans, and maybe by seeing me and hearing from me, that that’ll encourage them or encourage our male veterans to reach out to their battle buddies who are women, to say, hey, are you getting your VA care? Because veterans listen to other veterans.
Ms. Ali: It’s a great example of representation and seeing someone who looks like you or shares a similar background. I love earlier you used the word “minimizing.” I think about that a lot, in a lot of different spaces where you, unfortunately, see at times women underselling or minimizing their qualifications, their skills. Even in interviews I hear sometimes women say, well, I just helped with that, but they actually led the thing. They did the thing. And I want to tell them, in the middle of the interview, you didn’t help, you didn’t support, you did it. And it’s not bragging. It’s saying what you did. And people need to hear it.
Ms. Bradsher: The same thing this morning – this morning. (Laughter.) I work at CrossFit. So I do CrossFit every morning at 5:00 a.m. And a husband said, my wife got made colonel. And so we were in the middle of doing, like, the instructions and I was like, hold up, we have an announcement. And I said, I won’t say her name, but made colonel. And she said, it’s really a team effort. And I said, no. Can I say a bad word? I’m sorry, can I say what I actually said? I don’t know if this is for kids are not. (Laughter.) I said, no, it’s because you’re a badass.
Ms. Ali: You can say that. (Laughs.)
Ms. Bradsher: And, like, acknowledged the fact that she earned colonel. That’s huge. It’s such a small percentage in the army. And the first thing she wanted to do was shrink and not acknowledge. And it is a huge deal. It’s the peak of the pyramid for the vast – of so many. So I was just so proud of her. But the same thing, just, you know, wanting to, oh yeah, it’s, like, no, no. Be proud. Be proud.
Ms. Ali: Absolutely. And it matters to step in, in these moments, and to make sure that everyone hears that, like you did this morning.
Ms. Bradsher: Yeah, huge!
Ms. Ali: You talked about also doing all the different engagements for Women’s History Month. We have a great picture, I believe, of the first Women Veterans Community Support Forum.
Ms. Bradsher: Yes.
Ms. Ali: When was that?
Ms. Bradsher: This was – I was still chief, I think, for this particular one. I don’t think I was the deputy at this point. But, yeah, isn’t that amazing? Look at all those beautiful women.
Ms. Ali: It is amazing.
Ms. Bradsher: So proud. And, you know, I just think we really need to get America used to having women veterans. And, you know, the bottom line is, the veteran population represents all of the United States. We are incredibly diverse. We’ve all served. And, you know, I just think if our women veterans really just take a minute to acknowledge their service a little bit more, it would be lovely.
Ms. Ali: Yeah. And it matters to see these photos.
Ms. Bradsher: Yes.
Ms. Ali: Like you said, it matters to see that diversity of representation.
Ms. Bradsher: Yes, absolutely. And all the services.
Ms. Ali: And all the services as well. Well, you’re not only the first woman, you’re also the first woman of color. How does your service as a Black woman, in the most diverse armed forces our nation has ever seen, influence the way you do your work on a day-to-day basis at the VA?
Ms. Bradsher: Absolutely. You know, the Biden-Harris administration has worked very hard to ensure that equity is at the forefront of everything that we do. And, you know, we have really taken a hard look, and continuing to do so, at the decisions that we have made as an organization previously, and wanting to make sure that we provide the benefits equitably to all of our veterans because we have had, as I stated earlier, such a diverse – just diversity throughout the service members.
And so with that, wanting to make sure that we educate, and that as we are seeing trends that we share them so we know that veterans who file their claims a year – within that first year of separating, we see more equitable outcomes. We know that veterans who file their claims through a VSO, we see more equitable outcomes. And so we want to share that information. And we also want to encourage any veteran who feels that, due to their race or their gender, that they did not receive an equitable outcome, to please file a supplemental. We want to make sure that all veterans receive the care and benefits that they so richly deserve.
Ms. Ali: And you’ve said that the commitment to making sure to correct any wrongs and addressing those barriers that Black veterans may experience, compared to other veterans.
Ms. Bradsher: Absolutely. You know, we have – you know, for – we know that education, right? We know that for World War II that education benefits weren’t delivered equitably across. And so we want to make sure that education benefits, that all of our veterans know about the education benefits that are there, and that they encourage them to use them. Because they really – education is a key to so much.
Ms. Ali: Well, to close out, we would like to ask you three questions. We do that with every guest on Driving Impact, rapid fire. Are you ready?
Ms. Bradsher: OK, I’ll do my best.
Ms. Ali: Let’s do it. What are three words you would use to describe your career?
Ms. Bradsher: Unbelievable. Oh my goodness. Hardworking. And my career – describe my career. Oh, God, I’m really bad at this. I would say just, you know, blessed.
Ms. Ali: Hardworking, unbelievable, and blessed.
In your opinion, what does it mean to be American?
Ms. Bradsher: Proud. You know, the – our diversity is our strength. And that is the principle we were founded on. And it is just – I am incredibly proud to be an American.
Ms. Ali: And what is giving you hope right now?
Ms. Bradsher: What’s giving me hope is just how our veterans are able to be the pillars in so many communities. And so, you know, one of the struggles that we have is sometimes we really – we want to make sure that we always take care of our veterans, but there are also an incredible swath of veterans out there who are just leading change and who are really driving forces in all of their communities, and shared with that foundation, and the determination, and the perseverance, and the training that we’ve received, and our values and our morals, and being able to utilize those in the community.
Ms. Ali Deputy Secretary Bradsher, thank you very much for your service. Thank you for your leadership. And thank you for such a fun conversation here.
Ms. Bradsher: Thank you. It was great. I really enjoyed it.
Ms. Ali: Thank you.
You heard it yourself, the inspiring story of a fourth-generation military veteran who now holds the second-highest post in the VA. Deputy Secretary Tanya Bradsher draws inspiration from her family’s legacy to advocate for the nation’s most diverse generation of veterans. Thank you for tuning in to today’s conversation. You can find more episodes of Driving Impact on YouTube, or wherever you listen to podcasts.

14,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/north-korean-troops-deploy-russia-whats-military-effect,Mark F. Cancian and Chris H. Park,"October 25, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"The presence of North Korean troops in Russia has introduced a wild card into the two-and-a-half-year conflict. Russia is desperate for additional manpower, and this is one element of Russia’s effort to fill the ranks without a second mobilization. The numbers make this more than a symbolic effort, but the troops will likely be in support roles and constitute less than 1 percent of Russia’s forces. However, the full extent and impact are unknown, and the effort could expand.
Q1: Why does Russia want North Korean troops involved in its war effort?
A1: Russia is desperate for manpower but wants to avoid a second mobilization, which would involve involuntarily calling up Russian citizens.
Russia’s manpower problems have been widely reported. Western assessments estimate that Russia has suffered about 610,000 casualties. U.S. officials estimate that Russia is recruiting 25,000–30,000 new soldiers a month, barely keeping pace with the reported daily casualty rate of 1,000—or 30,000 a month.
At the same time, Russia seeks to expand the size of its armed forces. For the third time since the full-scale invasion, Russian president Vladimir Putin issued a decree in September 2024 to expand the Russian army. Replacing casualties and expanding the force requires a lot of people.
This personnel shortage is normal in wartime and not unique to Russia. Ukraine, too, faces shortcomings in replacing casualties as the war grinds along in its third year. During the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Vietnam, and Korea, the United States struggled to generate enough personnel. Russia has conscripts, but by law, they cannot serve outside of Russian territory. Although Putin has broad powers, this is one law he has been unwilling to break. He still faces public opinion, and the pressures to protect conscripts are formidable.
Russia conducted a partial mobilization in the fall of 2022 that called up 300,000 reservists. While chaotic and inefficient, the call eased the pressure on Russian forces during Ukrainian counteroffensives in Kherson and Kharkiv.
Putin has tried to avoid a second mobilization. Instead, Russia has pursued personnel strategies that minimize domestic political impact. Thus, it has offered large bonuses to recruits who volunteer, enlisted individual foreigners with promises of citizenship, recruited prisoners and others who do not meet normal standards, raised the maximum age for conscription and expanded the use of military contractors. Bringing in North Korean troops fits with this manpower strategy.
Q2: What is in this for North Korea?
A2: Another CSIS critical question discussed the diplomatic and political aspects of this activity, so there is no need to repeat that here. That piece also speculated that technology transfer might be involved. Money is likely a factor as well. Russia needs manpower and has money from its oil exports. North Korea has manpower but is desperate for foreign currency.
Russia is likely paying for all the deployment costs associated with the North Koreans as well as a stipend for the troops themselves. South Korean intelligence reportedly puts this at USD$2,000 per soldier per month. The average soldier deployed to Russia will see only a little of this money. The state benefits most.
This kind of arrangement between rich and poor combatants is not unusual. The United States paid many allied expenses during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also paid for the deployment of South Korean forces during the war in Vietnam.
Q3: Is this kind of deployment normal for North Korea?
A3: This deployment is historic for North Korea, which has previously sent advisory or specialist groups abroad but never a large ground force. During the Vietnam War, for example, it sent dozens of fighter pilots and military advisors to North Vietnam. During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, North Korea sent about 20 specialists to operate Soviet missile systems, train pilots, and fly aircraft. A small specialist group deployed to Syria in support of Bashar Al-Assad’s government during the civil war, and these may have been joined by two North Korean militia units. In contrast with its limited military overseas presence, North Korea has a large presence of civilian workers. Tens of thousands of North Korean civilians work overseas in Russian construction sites, Chinese factories and restaurants, and hospitals across Africa. This generates substantial foreign currency, most of which goes to the state.
Q4: How many North Korean troops are involved?
A4: The White House confirmed on October 23 that about 3,000 North Korean troops arrived in Russia between early and mid-October. South Korean officials assessed they were given Russian uniforms and IDs and are training to operate drones and other equipment. North Korea reportedly plans to send a total of four brigades, or between 10,000 and 12,000 troops, to Russia by December 2024 and may send additional units next year. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) cites a Russian intelligence report with similarly high numbers.
Many of these soldiers reportedly are part of XI Corps — or “Storm Corps”— a special forces army unit trained on infiltration, infrastructure sabotage, and assassinations. The corps may trace its history to the unit that carried out the 1968 Blue House raid that unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate South Korean president Park Chung-hee.
The South Korean Ministry of Defense puts North Korean special forces at 200,000 men, so North Korea retains most of its personnel even after the anticipated deployment.
Q5: How good are these troops?
A5: The effectiveness of the North Korean military as a whole is questionable. Although numerous and ideologically prepared, its equipment is mostly obsolescent, and readiness is poor because of fuel shortages. Troops are often diverted to help with the civilian economy. Defectors report that supplies to special operations forces are “not smooth” due to poor economic conditions Its conventional forces train for homeland defense and do not maintain capabilities for external deployment. Instead, North Korea has focused on nuclear weapons and missiles and, with these, has made itself a major regional presence.
ISW reports that the Russians are training North Koreans in bases mostly in eastern Russia. Nevertheless, if these are special operations forces, they will be much better prepared than the average North Korean unit. Further, based on what other militaries do, these deployed troops will be well trained and equipped because they have an immediate “real world” mission and not an “on call” mission. Typically, units planned for deployment undergo a special training program to prepare them and possess a full set of equipment, even if other units have to be stripped. In any case, the North Koreans will arrive trained and organized, not needing a long preparation.
Q6: What will these North Korean troops do?
A6: Neither Russia nor North Korea has announced what the role of these troops will be. Some have speculated that the troops might engage in deep reconnaissance and direct action for which they were trained (if, indeed, they are from North Korean special forces). However, having these troops fight on the front lines would be a risky strategy. It would make North Korea a direct combatant in the war, something that would be very difficult diplomatically. Further, there is the risk of desertions and prisoners. Both would embarrass North Korea because of what these troops might say. The high casualties are not likely to be a North Korean concern, given its control of state media.
Instead, the troops might perform support activities like transportation and maintenance. Russian logistics are notoriously bad, and additional personnel might help. Combat support roles like drone operations are possible. North Korean special operations forces might train Russian special forces and replacements. In whatever role, substituting North Koreans would free up Russian personnel for frontline service.
Q7: How much of a military impact will this North Korean deployment have?
A7: This is more than symbolism. These troops will help Russia’s war effort by providing needed military functions and easing manpower shortages. However, their presence at the U.S. reported levels will not be decisive. Russia has an estimated half million troops in Ukraine. Three thousand North Korean troops would constitute less than a 1 percent increase.
Q8: What should observers watch for?
A8: The two big questions are how many troops North Korea sends and what roles they take on. If the numbers are limited and roles confined to support and logistics, then this will be helpful for Russia but not decisive. However, if the roles change or the numbers expand significantly, as the South Koreans believe, then this could have a major effect on the course of the war. That will become clearer in the next few weeks.

15,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/why-striking-iranian-nuclear-facilities-bad-idea,Doreen Horschig,"October 25, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Israel on October 1 is likely to push the Netanyahu administration to continue its escalating responses in the regional conflict. The incident follows similar strikes in April. While neither attack inflicted extensive damage, Tehran’s decision to directly target civilian areas, including Tel Aviv, raises alarms.
In April, Israel opted for a measured response on Iranian military sites. Now, numerous other options seem to be on the table, ranging from attacks on Iran’s oil refineries and targeted assassinations on Iran’s Revolutionary Guards to potential strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Proponents have argued that the current moment is ripe for an attack on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure, citing the urgent need to thwart Iran’s imminent nuclear breakout time, the failure of diplomatic efforts, and the ongoing regional conflict.
Yet this perspective glosses over some of the complexities and potential repercussions of such an attack. The Israeli government’s choice to refrain from striking nuclear facilities is a sound decision and should not be reconsidered. Targeting Iran’s nuclear facilities would not eliminate the existential threat a nuclear Iran poses to Israel. In fact, it would exacerbate it. While a diplomatic solution is slow and cumbersome, it remains the most viable option for curbing Iranian nuclear ambitions.
The Limits of Military Strikes
Critics advocating military strikes often view diplomacy as an inadequate tool against Iranian proliferation. While it is undeniable that negotiations have faltered and the prospects for a new nuclear deal are bleak, the notion that military strikes represent a logical alternative is flawed for several reasons.
First, completely destroying Iran’s nuclear facilities is an incredible challenge. Unlike Israel’s counter-proliferation strikes in 1981 against Iraq and in 2007 against Syria—both targeting isolated reactors—Iran’s nuclear program consists of numerous uranium production and enrichment sites, mines, and research facilities, all of which are more advanced and dispersed. To dismantle this program would require an extraordinarily complex military operation, with the risk that any “centrifuge program could be reconstituted in a more survivable form relatively quickly.”
Second, key installations, such as Iran’s uranium enrichment facilities, are fortified, requiring bunker-buster munitions for total destruction. This would likely require U.S. support, particularly through its more advanced Massive Ordnance Penetrator designed for targeting underground sites (while Israel possesses a smaller bunker buster, the damage would likely be limited). Yet President Biden has expressed opposition to striking Iranian nuclear sites. Any support for such Israeli actions could draw Washington deeper into the conflict, provoking international outrage and complicating U.S. efforts to garner global support on other fronts, including Ukraine and the South China Sea.
Third, even in a best-case scenario where military strikes effectively destroy key facilities, the knowledge base surrounding uranium enrichment, reactor technology, and the fuel cycle necessary for sustaining nuclear fission would remain intact. Eliminating this knowledge would require sustained covert operations within Iran’s scientific community—a strenuous and hard-to-sustain endeavor. While Israel has historically employed targeted assassinations to limit this knowledge, it is questionable whether such a strategy aligns with Mossad’s long-term objectives in dealing with Iranian nuclear capabilities.
The Counterproductive Nature of Strikes
More crucial than the persistence of technical knowledge is the determination to pursue nuclear weapons. Past military aggression against Iranian nuclear facilities has only bolstered Iran’s resolve, which might be more accurate. Research indicates that despite Israeli covert operations—including cyberattacks and assassinations—Iran has consistently increased its stockpile of enriched uranium and operational centrifuges. In 2021, Iran enriched uranium to 60 percent for the first time in direct response to the Israeli sabotage operation against Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility in 2021 (90 percent is considered weapons-grade uranium). Israeli operations only temporarily halt Iranian nuclear ambitions. The most successful military interventions occur when a proliferation threat is nascent; Iran is well past that threshold.
Furthermore, Iranian nuclear hedging has largely been in response to perceived threats to its survival. Looking at another example, Pakistan’s nuclear program, for instance, emerged as a direct reaction to the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. Similarly, Israel’s decision to develop nuclear weapons was heavily influenced by the 1956 Suez Crisis and subsequent regional tensions. A full-scale Israeli assault on Iranian nuclear facilities would likely heighten Tehran’s threat perception and accelerate its pursuit of a nuclear arsenal.
While military strikes might temporarily hinder Iran’s nuclear advancements, they would be unlikely to halt them altogether and would likely drive Iran’s nuclear program further underground.
A Path Forward
Critics of strikes on nuclear facilities often cite the risk of igniting a broader regional war. With escalating conflicts involving Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen, such a war has already begun. Yet military strikes could prolong existing conflicts and contribute to a chaotic regional landscape.
Central Intelligence Agency director William Burns said earlier this month that there is no evidence Iran has decided to develop a nuclear weapon. Thus far, Tehran has leveraged its nuclear program as a hedge rather than an offensive capability. While the country has been inching closer to proliferation, it has not crossed the threshold, indicating a—albeit slim—window for diplomatic engagement. While diplomacy has neither been particularly effective nor an interest of Israel, it may be useful to pursue incremental diplomatic efforts rather than aiming for a grand, comprehensive deal like the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Deal of Action. Israel could back limited, tactical deals that freeze the most concerning aspects of Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for partial sanctions relief. Smaller, more achievable diplomatic efforts can slow down the process while avoiding the all-or-nothing failures of past negotiations. Intermediaries in the region could facilitate indirect negotiations between Israel, the U.S., European countries, and Iran. This could help keep communication channels open without committing to formal talks. China or Russia, with whom Iran is growing its ties, also have an interest in keeping Iran from proliferating and might be willing to push Iran towards nuclear restraint.
Israel may want to push for tougher sanctions specifically focused on Iran’s nuclear and missile programs, particularly in cooperation with other powers. Sanctions should be specific to target industries or individuals tied directly to the nuclear program, such as blocking technology imports and freezing assets related to Tehran’s nuclear infrastructure.
It is essential for Israel to consider the broader implications of any military action against Iran. While hardliners like former prime minister Naftali Bennett may tout military strikes as a historic opportunity to reshape the Middle East, Israel must weigh whether such actions align with its long-term interests and help mitigate its growing isolation from the international community.

16,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/syria-iran-and-hezbollahs-savior-and-achilles-heel,Natasha Hall,"October 16, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"As the Netanyahu government engages in wars throughout the Middle East to degrade Iran and its allied militias, Biden administration officials are reportedly calling these military victories a “history-defining moment.” But is this moment history-defining in the way that White House officials seem to hope it is? Without a political solution that accommodates the millions yearning for peace and justice in the Middle East including Palestinians, Lebanese, and Syrians, it’s likely not. Israel’s tactical victories and Iran’s losses will be ephemeral.
Regardless of how hard Israel pummels its adversaries in the Middle East, both Iran and Hezbollah have hundreds of miles of territory sweeping from the Mediterranean to Iran to recuperate in. Hezbollah and Iran also play the long game when others, like the United States, are too impatient. This tenacity has allowed them to entrench their control in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and, of course, Lebanon. Though Iran and Hezbollah are beaten down now, they have proven to be resilient in the face of tactical losses by being able to maneuver in conflict-affected and fragile states, where others have given up.
Syria is a case in point. Hezbollah and Iran’s interventions in Syria since the start of the civil war have proven to be an advantage and disadvantage at certain moments. For example, recent reporting has suggested that their intervention in Syria has made them vulnerable to U.S. and Israeli intelligence gathering and targeting. However, this is not the first time Hezbollah and Iran have suffered due to their role in the war but stayed the course for longer-term strategic resilience.
In 2010, the Iranian-backed “axis of resistance”—with Hezbollah at the center—seemed both powerful and righteous. Hezbollah had the goodwill of the Arab world as a non-state armed group that forced the mighty Israel to withdraw its forces from Lebanon after an 18-year occupation. The war in Syria changed that image. From peaceful protests that demanded reform in 2011, Syria spiraled into a bloody conflict that became a playground for regional and international actors until the present day. Among those actors were Russia, Iran, and Iran’s proxy, Hezbollah.
By helping to prop up the Bashar al-Assad regime through brute force, Hezbollah and Iran showed that resisting injustice in the region was a secondary task. The principal goal was building power. Hezbollah drafted thousands of fighters to besiege and attack densely populated areas in Syria. In doing so, their image was tarnished. They were no longer confronting “the Zionist enemy,” their stated objective. Instead, they were killing fellow Muslims who were demanding freedom from an autocratic regime.
Despite those ideological losses, Hezbollah and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Iran’s elite units that carry out the Islamic Republic’s ambitious military and political agenda outside the country, stayed the course. Their intervention was so critical to Assad’s survival that Syrians discussed whether the regime had promised Hezbollah control of areas in western Syria like Madaya, where Hezbollah forces helped to besiege and starve civilians. Iran has also been informally expanding control of areas in the east and around Damascus.
Because Syria has been so distant from the interests of the international community in recent years, Hezbollah and Iran have been able to do as they please. A desperate Syrian regime was beholden to Iran’s interests, allowing the Islamic Republic to further spread its influence, despite occasional Israeli attacks on assets in Syria. Even those who fought the regime and Iran-backed supporters like Hezbollah were forced to acquiesce. In places like Daraa, which rebel groups had controlled before pro-regime forces retook the province in 2018, Hezbollah has been able to recruit members in desperate communities.
But desperation in conflict also breeds malcontent and corruption. With Hezbollah and Iran’s expanding influence came increased risks. As a Financial Times piece recently reported, Hezbollah began working and sharing intelligence with far more people than it had in the past. This exposed them to Israeli and U.S. intelligence gathering, which may have, in part, led to their tremendous losses in recent weeks. In just a month, Hezbollah has lost its spiritual, political, and military leader, Hassan Nasrallah, numerous deputies, and thousands of rank and file. Most importantly, it has lost its mystique as an effective bulwark against Israel. Iran has also been humiliated by Israeli attacks in the heart of an IRGC compound, assassinations of IRGC commanders, and attacks on Iranian diplomats. On September 8, both actors lost a secret weapons manufacturing facility deep underground in Syria in an Israeli commando raid.
The White House believes that these events could pave the way for a new future for Lebanon—or a “new order,” as Israel called the operation to assassinate Hassan Nasrallah. But if the United States does not have a real plan for a new order that comprehensively addresses all the festering wounds in the region, Syria and other protracted conflicts will once again become an advantage for Iran and Hezbollah. They will recuperate and reassert themselves when the time is right, and they do not have to confront a militarily superior Israel or United States on their own terms.
Unresolved desperation in the region’s protracted conflicts could breed malcontent and corruption that work against the United States next time. From Lebanon to Iran, militants have infinite hiding places and hundreds of miles of underground tunnels to transport supplies and personnel. And with Israel’s brutal operations in Gaza, the West Bank, and now Lebanon, there will be an infinite number of future recruits from the region and beyond.
Rather than confront this political reality, the “day after” for Syria, Gaza and, now Lebanon, has become a quaint notion that conflicts end through reconstruction or technocratic fixes. They typically do not. Recent history in the region shows that without an acceptable political “day after,” there will just be peaks and troughs of endless violence. This will have ramifications for Israel for the foreseeable future and no amount of bombing on Lebanon or elsewhere will likely change that. In fact, the consequences of Israeli military campaigns will create new openings for Iran and Hezbollah in places like Syria long after the United States wants to move on—just as it had before October 7.
Any future U.S. administration needs to be honest about its own appetite for or interest in war in the Middle East. While its ally, Israel, may be voracious, the United States is not for good reason. Because when the smoke clears, Netanyahu may survive another day, but U.S. credibility and security will be shattered with no discernable long-term gains and no plan to deal with a fiercer axis of resistance emerging from the ashes. If Israel is not amenable to peace, the United States will need to use its leverage to force a truce. In this war, such a strategy would play to U.S. strengths and interests. Dealing with protracted conflicts in a deprioritized region does not.

17,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/fragmentation-or-mindedness-rethinking-responsible-behavior-age-multilateralism,James Andrew Lewis,"October 16, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This commentary was initially presented as opening remarks by James A. Lewis at the Securing Cyberspace 2024 conference, “Responsible Cyber Behaviour in Practice: A Global View,” held at the Royal United Services Institute on October 9, 2024.
Security in cyberspace is ultimately determined by relations among powerful states. The trends shaping these relations include the revanchism of the former Communist giants, the rise of China, the decline of Europe, and the end of America’s unipolar moment, but above all, they are shaped by the close of the era of great power cooperation. Between 2009 and 2015, when states could cooperate, they were able to reach an agreement on norms for responsible state behavior. Now that cooperation has been replaced with competition and conflict, what is left?
To an extent, this change makes UN norms an artifact of an earlier time. The concepts that guided agreement in 2015 and 2021, which held that mutual understandings and cooperative mechanisms for a global community would reduce the chances of conflict and miscalculation, no longer apply. For cybersecurity, the shared global vision for responsible behavior peaked in 2015. While a formal agreement was reached in 2021, the spirit of the agreement was not. For example, confidence-building measures (CBMs) that do not interest potential opponents have limited utility for global great power competition. Building confidence among nations that are unlikely to ever fight can have value, but it is limited. There are no regular negotiations or agreed framework for talks between the United States and China, much less with Russia, as was the case in the Cold War. This makes the question before us what can be done without a willingness to compromise. That question is fundamental for cybersecurity because the majority of harmful actions are carried out by a few powerful states.
It may provide a degree of assurance if we consider the hypothesis that the long-term trend towards connectivity and integration, which began several centuries ago and is driven by technological and economic change, will eventually lead to a more integrated global society based on respect for individuals and their rights. Certainly, the signs of increased social and economic connectivity are profound. But this outcome is not certain, and it is worth recalling the Keynesian caveat in the long term when we ask what can be done in the next few years.
There are also trends, such as economic globalization, which despite the growing penchant for sovereignty, are now more than two centuries old and apparently relentless. There is the digital connectivity that creates cyberspace and has become indispensable, even addictive. But these are not enough to change the short-term impulse toward fragmentation. However, fragmentation can be managed. Fragmentation does not mean bifurcation, and while it creates friction points in international relations, it is better to think of this as a period of competition and hostility among opposing blocs, with most other states seeking to be neutral or nonaligned to avoid conflict.
Democracies cannot be said to have a strategy to change this. The fundamental problem for responsible state behavior is the inability to get major opponents to change their behavior. This is the strategic problem that confronts democracies and puts them on the defensive. The long-predicted multipolar world is now here, but it is more difficult to manage than expected. Some of this reflects an unwillingness to abandon strategic concepts from the twentieth century, like deterrence. It reflects in part a relative decline in transatlantic power and influence, if only because of the rise of other states. Above all, it reflects the daunting challenge of reshaping a world greatly changed since 1990 and the end of the Cold War, something that will require vision, leadership, and most probably a crisis, to incentivize change.
The greatest problem for responsible behavior is the general decline in support for the principles that undergird the UN Charter. The UN Charter, with its limits on the use of force and coercion and its balance between sovereignty and universal rights, is at the core of responsible state behavior and the norms agreed in the UN Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG). The UN Charter grew out of the experiences of the 1930s and 1940s, which showed that conflict between major powers that do not share values is unavoidable. But this lesson has been ignored by some and forgotten by others.
Does this mean war among major powers is inevitable? Not necessarily, although the chances of armed conflict are greater than a decade ago. Nuclear powers are cautious about war with each other, although they will exploit every opportunity, including cyber operations, to gain an advantage in their contests with each other. They will also be less cautious about war with nonnuclear neighbors. Miscalculation by dictators surrounded by sycophants adds to the risk, and CBMs governing war and international security are no longer considered seriously by Russia, China, or the other nations likely to enter into conflict with democracies.
Responsible state behavior must be balanced against the realities of competition. The ideas of 2015, that norms and CBMs for cyberspace were based on the assumption that states sought to avoid conflict and that this would lead to a greater agreement to limit the use of cyber operations among states. Some degree of fragmentation is unavoidable in a global environment shaped by the rebalancing of international power. While the United States remains primus inter pares, the unipolar moment is over. The rise of China can be explained in part as an effort to counter what it would call “American hegemony.” Other emerging powers are also eager to assert their independence. The expansion of the BRICS, although it is a feeble instrument, is one sign of larger political divisions.
This is a difficult prognosis, but fragmentation is not necessarily bad if it is accompanied by engagement among contending parties. Engagement is lacking, however. The leaders of China and Russia believe the West is in decline—they make a good case, by the way—and seek to build global support for a competing vision that emphasizes sovereignty and places the state over the rights of individuals. Most people find this authoritarian alternative less appealing, but unfortunately, some governments do not.
The credibility of appeals to adhere to a rule-based order was damaged after the unsanctioned invasions of Iraq and Ukraine, and after Snowden’s charges, which exposed a subterranean world of cyber espionage in which the United States is only one actor among many and by far not the most irresponsible. Democracies may be right about the value of norms, but by itself, this does not provide a compelling diplomatic strategy for hostile or skeptical audiences. China, Russia, and their supporters are unwilling to engage, much less observe responsible state behavior. Consider the effectiveness of Russian and Chinese propaganda in shaping global views of the war in Ukraine. These have been surprisingly successful, meaning support for responsible state behavior is not a foregone or automatic conclusion.
To advance responsible behavior, a new diplomatic strategy is essential. This strategy would accept fragmentation and set three goals. The first goal would make a more compelling case for the norms of responsible state behavior. A compelling case for responsible state behavior can be built around respect for sovereign rights and the utility of avoiding a world shaped entirely by power. The recently agreed-upon UN draft cybercrime convention shows that there is still room for agreement, even if some agreed unwillingly. A key point must be that responsible state behavior supports development by creating the conditions for growth that all nations will need for a global digital economy.
A second goal would be to reinforce responsible state behavior by creating accountability for malicious cyber actions. There is very limited accountability now because there is no penalty for irresponsible behavior. Accountability has always been a weakness in the international system. States are understandably reluctant to use force or the threat of force, especially for incidents where culpability can be murky and actual damage is minor. This makes it essential to find agreement on the conditions under which states governed by the rule of law would decide to impose consequences individually or collectively.
Finding agreement on accountability, even among like-minded states, will be complicated since most cyber actions fall below the threshold of the use of force upon which norms for international security is predicated. Bear in mind that before 2020 had never come before the UN Security Council. This is changing as the damage and risk of malicious cyber action continue to increase, driven by our dependence on digital technology and because networks have become the space for great power competition. The issue of accountability remains whether there are actions that victim states, collectively or individually, are willing to undertake in response to irresponsible state behavior.
Creating accountability unavoidably raises the question of agreement on evidentiary standards for attribution and the development of a menu of retaliatory measures that are in accordance with international law. These are political decisions, and the imposition of meaningful consequences may require a greater acceptance of risk than most states are willing to accept. It also requires the development of new measures of coercion. Russia, Iran, and North Korea are all capable of shrugging off the sanctions that have been the primary type of consequences that democracies have been willing to use. China may be more sensitive to economic sanctions, but many countries fear Chinese retaliation affecting access to its enormous market. Yet there is little incentive to observe norms if there is no consequence for failing to do so and these states are convinced of the legitimacy, even the necessity, of their foreign policies.
Precedents for this situation are suggestive. After 1933, democracies were ultimately unable to avoid war with authoritarian states, in good measure. They failed to respond to acts of aggression in Asia and Europe because their defenses were inadequate, and because they were reluctant to use their offensive capabilities. The chief differences between now and the 1930s are the creation of global institutions for governance and the advent of nuclear weapons. These factors reduce the arena for conflict.
The advent of nuclear weapons is even more important for shaping international relations and the link between cyber and nuclear in great power conflict deserves more attention. Since acquiring these weapons, nuclear states have avoided direct armed conflict. A related precedent comes from the Cuban Missile Crisis, when the prospect of nuclear war led opponents to begin negotiations that led, after twenty years, to a framework of agreements that reduced the chances of armed conflict. We have not yet had a crisis in cyberspace, despite lurid claims in the media, which can bring opponents to the negotiating table.
So, a third element is to create engagement strategies, for both “neutrals” and opponents. To some extent, this has been done for neutrals. While the UN Cybercrime Convention raises concerns with some audiences, it shows a shared global concern over the risks and harms of cybercrime. The progress of the U.S. Counter Ransomware Initiative, which met last week and discussed accountability, shows a similar interest among its members in a common approach. Work in regional groups, particularly on CBMs, has been a marked success, and work in the OEWG and the UN Programme of Action offers potential mechanisms to expand common understandings of what responsible state behavior entails. Expanding common understandings and accountability and undertaking engagement strategies all offer a path for strengthening responsible state behavior.
But none of these directly address the issue of conflict between opposing great powers. Where does responsible state behavior fit in this complex environment? First, we must recognize that democracies are the demanders in cyber diplomacy. Their ability to meaningfully change the behavior of opponents who cannot be deterred or defeated is limited, making the issue of how to manage conflict.
Second, opponents will not compromise, making continued conflict and some degree of further political bifurcation unavoidable, even if the return of a modernized Iron Curtain is impossible, given the deep transnational interconnections created in the last 35 years. They face an inevitable erosion of their claims to legitimacy with their own citizens, making them vulnerable in ways that even troubled democracies are not.
Third, common understandings and shared institutions for global governance remain better than the alternatives. The norms and other mechanisms for responsible state behavior are a part of global governance and while they are currently in decline, technological change and commercial interconnection suggest this is temporary. Norms and governance will become even more essential, and states’ actions can accelerate and strengthen the pace and form of responsible state behavior’s resurgence.
Fragmentation, while unavoidable, can be managed to reduce the chance of conflict and to lay the foundation for a more secure future. The agreements of 2021 were written for a different world, but it is a world that, with the right policies, has a chance of eventually returning.

18,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/lina-khatib-war-spreads-lebanon,Unknown,"October 15, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS podcast published on October 15, 2024. Listen to the podcast here.
Jon Alterman: Lina Khatib, welcome to Babel.
Lina Khatib: Thank you for having me.
Jon Alterman: Were you surprised at how quickly the Israeli confrontation with Hezbollah has escalated?
Lina Khatib: Actually, it has not been a quick escalation, if you think about it. Hezbollah started launching rockets on Israel on October 8, 2023. It took almost a year for this escalation to happen. Hezbollah probably thought that it could go on indefinitely launching rockets at Israel with very few repercussions and, obviously, the calculations of both Hezbollah and Iran have been proven to be quite wrong in this regard.
Jon Alterman: What are the immediate effects of the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, who led Hezbollah for 35 years?
Lina Khatib: This has been one of the biggest blows to Hezbollah morally. He's been in charge for 30 years, but the cultivation of the image has really taken off since 2006, so we're talking about almost two decades of this person being presented as almost superhuman. His image had been tightly linked to that of Hezbollah itself, so that, in the eyes of many supporters of Hezbollah, Nasrallah represented strength, resilience, victory, and all those qualities that Hezbollah wanted associated with itself. At the morale level, having this figure eliminated is a huge blow.
Jon Alterman: So that's in the near term. What do you think the longer-term impacts are?
Lina Khatib: We have to remember that Hezbollah ultimately is an institution and not a kind of small, rogue group led by one charismatic guy. Although Nasrallah had all those qualities, his loss can be compensated for at the level of operations. So, I wouldn't dwell too much on Nasrallah himself. I would dwell on how Israel is trying to weaken Hezbollah as an institution. I think this is the bigger story here, and this is something that, of course, Israel is making a lot of progress toward; however, Hezbollah is not an organization that can be dismantled with just military attacks.
Jon Alterman: I want to come to the Israeli strategy in a moment, but I want to stay with the question of Lebanon and how this feels in Lebanon. How are Lebanese responding to the attacks on Hezbollah? My sense is that some are celebrating it, while some are mourning it. How would you break it down?
Lina Khatib: The people who are against Hezbollah, and these are the majority in Lebanon, are not unhappy to see Hezbollah being weakened; however, they are not happy with the way Israel is doing it, because it is being done in a way that is bringing large-scale destruction to Lebanon, both physical and in terms of human casualties. This is something that people are not on board with. I wrote about this at one point by saying that people do not want to be liberated from Hezbollah at the hands of invaders.
They are feeling that they are kind of stuck in a really toxic dynamic. People are also worried about potential tension inside Lebanon between Hezbollah supporters and those who do not support Hezbollah, partly because of the large number of displaced people in Lebanon who are sleeping on the streets, literally. And there is potential for social tension to flare up further down the line if this continues for a long period of time. People are being cautious not to celebrate publicly.
Deep down, they are concerned. They're concerned about domestic stability more than anything else. Even Hezbollah's opponents recognize that Hezbollah, as an organization, cannot be canceled through military action. So, there is concern about the political future of Lebanon more than anything else.
Jon Alterman: What do you see as Hezbollah's next move, given what's been happening for the last month?
Lina Khatib: It's difficult to predict at this stage because Hezbollah is an organization that likes to save face. They do not like to be seen as having been defeated by Israel. So, they will try to find a way out that saves face.
I'm not sure that Hezbollah is there yet. Hezbollah, so far, has been able to operate in a decentralized manner with various small groups fighting Israel in the south without the need for central command coordination. This can go on for a while. Hezbollah is basically going to do this for as long as it feels it can.
Ultimately, I would say the decision is not really Hezbollah's. It's Tehran's decision. When Tehran starts feeling that the cost of continuing down this path has become higher than the gain, then it will try to find a face-saving way for Hezbollah to stop, such as the scenario that unfolded in the Iran-Iraq War in the '80s. Eventually Iran at that time said, ""We're just going to have to swallow the poison for the sake of the people in a way."" This is the only scenario that I think Iran could use to say, ""Okay, this is why Hezbollah can now stop."" But sadly, we're not there yet.
Jon Alterman: What would that look like if Hezbollah lost its patron and decided to scale down an expansive organization? Would that be a dramatic move portrayed as a modest move? Would it look like a collapse with everybody seeing it as a collapse? How would that unfold?
Lina Khatib: This is the thing. Iran will not want it to look like a collapse. It will want it to be seen as a sacrifice for the sake of the people. In reality, it's a significant weakening of Iran's regional influence because Hezbollah is the most important asset for Iran in the Middle East. Then, there is the possibility that Hezbollah might find a compromise solution with the Lebanese state to turn it into an auxiliary military force, a bit like the Popular Mobilization Forces in Iraq, which are technically an auxiliary force reporting to the prime minister's office. Now, the difference with Hezbollah is that it's regarded as a legitimate defense force by the Lebanese state, but it does not report to the state in any way. So, it's given exceptional status. If Iran is significantly weakened and still wants to have some influence in Lebanon, then it might have to accept this kind of lesser position for Hezbollah. From the Iranian perspective, this would be the best-case scenario further down the line, but not the best-case scenario for Lebanon or for regional stability.
Jon Alterman: Do you see a vacuum in Lebanese politics right now? If you do, who could fill that vacuum, and how would they fill it?
Lina Khatib: This is the thing. This compromise that I'm talking about can only happen if Lebanon resurrects the political process to elect a president and have a proper cabinet in place, not just the caretaker cabinet that we have now in Lebanon. This means there will be no vacuum. You can't just have the Hezbollah solution, which is the Lebanonization solution, without sorting out the bigger political picture because you need a cabinet and a president.
This cannot happen without international pressure. Iran is not going to just do this willingly. It will only accept doing this if it feels it has no other choice. Here we go to what the United States wants to do about Iran, which is at the heart of the matter.
I always say that Hezbollah has been feeling so comfortable in Lebanon because, in general, U.S. foreign policy has been very complacent regarding Iran's regional influence in the Middle East. This has allowed Hezbollah to grow in influence and even expand its activities into Syria. It has also allowed the Houthis and even the militias in Iraq to feel empowered. I think if U.S. foreign policy changes so that we have a linkage between the Iranian nuclear file and the file of Iran's regional interventions, so that Iran can see that the only way a nuclear deal can be resurrected is if Iran agrees to these compromises at the level of its regional involvement, then we can have the scenario that I talked about apply in Lebanon. But again, this requires Washington to change its Iran policy.
Jon Alterman: Is there a Gulf Arab state role here, and are Gulf Arab states willing to play a role here?
Lina Khatib: I think Gulf states have been hoping, for decades now, that the United States would develop a comprehensive strategy regarding Iran because even though Saudi Arabia, for example, has had bilateral diplomatic relations restored with Iran, the worry that Iran is a spoiler is still there deep down. Ultimately, Iran continues to support the Houthis. The Houthis are no longer attacking Saudi Arabia, but this is not a long-term solution. So, they are looking for a long-term solution beyond de-escalation. De-escalation is not the answer. De-escalation is just because they need to pursue their economic projects and don't want the headache of Iranian missiles landing on them, but this is not a solution. They definitely will be on board if Washington develops this comprehensive strategy that I mentioned.
Jon Alterman: If I could ask you to put yourself in the mindset of the Iranians, what choices do you think they have?
Lina Khatib: At the moment, the Iranians see that the costs are mounting; however, they don't yet feel pressured enough to radically change their behavior in the Middle East. They feel that they have incurred huge losses in the past and were able to withstand those losses and rebuild. They are still a bit hopeful that they can get through this.
An example is 2006. Although Hezbollah declared victory against Israel at that time, the reality is that the war ended in a stalemate. Hezbollah incurred huge losses, but it managed to recoup these losses eventually, and it managed to become even stronger militarily and politically afterwards.
Iran is not yet feeling the heat. The other issue for Iran is that it obviously wants to protect its nuclear program. Iran will feel it needs to change its behavior once its nuclear program is really threatened and its regional influence is no longer recoverable in the future after being weakened.
Jon Alterman: What would create that circumstance?
Lina Khatib: Diplomacy. When I talk about Iran, a lot of people assume that I'm calling for bombing Iran. I don't think that's the answer. I go back to the nuclear negotiations. The nuclear program is very important for Iran. If it feels that its regional investment in the Middle East is starting to wane, then that will make it adhere even more strongly to wanting a nuclear program in place, because it will feel that it needs something to build its projection of power on. If these two issues are linked, and Iran is presented with a concrete deal that says, ""We will have a nuclear deal with you if you agree to moderate your behavior in terms of all these proxies you're supporting,” this can be coupled with a process for Lebanon, as well as resurrecting the peace talks in Yemen with the Houthis.
It's actually very complicated. To really sort out Lebanon and Hezbollah, you need to sort out the Iranian issue, and to sort out the Iranian issue, you need to sort out its involvement in multiple countries and have all these processes run simultaneously. You can't compartmentalize the Yemen issue, the Lebanon issue, and the Syria issue anymore.
We're talking about a huge shift in the balance of power in the Middle East, and this is not going to be something that will happen overnight. None of what I'm talking about is something that can be achieved in a short period of time at all. It'll probably be something that the new U.S. administration will spend the duration of the administration working on.
But as an international community, we can’t afford to live with the status quo. We've seen what living with the status quo has brought us. It's brought us instability that is only growing in the Middle East. It's now time for a reset, and this is what I'm talking about.
Jon Alterman: What does a nuclear deal look like in a time of renewed great power competition? We can't count on the Russians playing a constructive role and it may be a leap to count on the Chinese playing a constructive role. How much does that complicate what you're calling for?
Lina Khatib: They're not going to be actors you can depend on. One thing playing out in Syria at the moment is Russia's influence there and how important it is for Russia to have long-term influence in that region.
It's really unfortunate that Syria is, in a way, stuck between having to be under Iranian influence or Russian influence. Neither is a good solution, frankly. Under the circumstances, dealing with Russia is not about just the nuclear issue. Again, it has to be about Russia's influence in the region as a whole and that's a whole other headache for the United States, especially with Ukraine still going on in the background.
You might get a compromise from Russia on one thing, but Russia will want something else in return. I expect that in return, Russia will want to have a long-term presence on the Mediterranean and that sadly means a bleak picture for Syria, because it means continued Russian influence in Syria. Again, I'm not saying the future is positive. It's just a matter of what is the least bad scenario.
Jon Alterman: When we talk about least bad scenarios, one of them is that the conflict between Israel and Lebanon stays contained. Do you expect it to stay contained, or do you think we still have some expansion in this conflict to come?
Lina Khatib: It's highly likely that Israel is going to expand its military campaign. It’s not likely that Hezbollah is able to do much more than what it has done simply because of the communications network compromise due to Israel's infiltration. Hezbollah will be very limited in being able to plan complex, large-scale military operations.
Israel is trying to inflict as high a cost as possible on Hezbollah and Lebanon, and it is going after Hezbollah's assets, even soft ones across Lebanon from what I can tell. This means an expansion of the military campaign, which of course is bad news for Lebanon because many civilians are dying as a result of this. The infrastructure was already weak, and it's now being devastated, and the country is bankrupt. For Lebanon to recover from what has happened is already very difficult. With the expansion, it’s going to be very, very, very tough for Lebanese recovery further down the line.
Jon Alterman: Overall, is it your sense that Netanyahu is calculating correctly or incorrectly as he thinks about military action in Lebanon?
Lina Khatib: I think he's calculating incorrectly because, for a while, Israel was quite strategic in its actions in Lebanon, although there sadly was collateral damage and the killing of civilians. However, when Israel was targeting Hezbollah commanders, killing around 500 in targeted attacks and the pagers attack, these things did not translate to wide-scale destruction in Lebanon.
Now we have a different scenario in which I feel that Netanyahu’s ego is probably leading him to overextend. I think the ground invasion was not a good idea because even though Israel is saying, ""This is easier than we expected,"" the fact is, Hezbollah still has very strong networks in the south and has a lot of experience dealing with ground fighting. This is something that Israel will find difficult to claim victory in.
Also, the attacks on the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, attacks on rescue workers in Lebanon who are not affiliated with Hezbollah, and hitting civilian targets that are not all connected with Hezbollah. Things like planting the Israeli flag in the garden that Iran had given funding for after 2006. It's not necessary. It just provoked people in Lebanon. Even people who hate Hezbollah felt that it is insulting to have the flag of another country raised in Lebanon. There are many moves, both military and symbolic, being made now that are not boding well for the future. Netanyahu made a statement saying, ""The fight is with Hezbollah, not the Lebanese people,"" but at the same time, he conducts acts that are alienating the Lebanese people who would have maybe agreed to having peace with Israel further down the line.
Jon Alterman: If there's one constructive thing that the United States can and should do in the near-term, what do you think it would be?
Lina Khatib: Definitely talk to Israel. Biden and Netanyahu are talking, but I feel that right now, Netanyahu is trying to do as much as he can, while he can, before the administration changes. I think the current administration is, frankly, being a bit too complacent, and this is something that Netanyahu is detecting.
Diplomatic pressure can increase on part of the United States, because this is the only thing that would stop this overextension that Israel is engaging in. Frankly, it is actually beneficial for Israel not to engage in overextension, so if the United States increases pressure on Israel diplomatically, this ultimately works in Israel's interest. The hope is that there will be people in the Israeli government that can see that and cooperate with the United States to start to have some checks on Netanyahu's behavior.
Jon Alterman: If you were advising the transition team that's preparing the next administration to come in, what should they do before the inauguration on January 20? What should they prepare to do immediately after the new president takes office on January 20 to try to encourage a reconstitution of Lebanese politics on more constructive lines?
Lina Khatib: Immediately, there needs to be signaling that there's going to be a shift in policy regarding Iran and a shift in the way the United States deals with the Israel-Palestine issue. Ultimately, these two files are now more interconnected than ever, and the only way for stability to happen in Lebanon or elsewhere in the region is for a new approach that looks at the linkages between the two files. So, this is something that should happen as soon as the new president is announced. What should happen after is for this to be put into action.
The old compartmentalization of these two issues has not worked, and the compartmentalization of the nuclear Iran file and the regional intervention file has also not worked. Now is the time for an interconnected U.S. foreign policy regarding the Middle East, and if Israel, Arab Gulf countries, and Lebanon hears this, and then action is taken to start implementing this new phase, this would be beneficial to everyone in the region. This would be very different from the 2006 scenario, in which the U.S. administration talked about the birth plans of a new Middle East, but ultimately, that only brought further devastation to the region. It's time for the new administration to show that it has learned from previous mistakes.
Jon Alterman: Lina Khatib, thank you for joining us on Babel.
Lina Khatib: Thank you. Always a pleasure.

19,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/helm-innovation-discussion-vadm-pitts-advancing-naval-capabilities,Unknown,"October 8, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS event hosted on October 8, 2024. Watch the full video here.
Seth G. Jones: Good morning. I’m Seth Jones, president of the Defense and Security Department at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Welcome to all.
On behalf of CSIS and the U.S. Naval Institute, it is my pleasure to welcome you to the next event in the Maritime Security Dialogue Series. This series is made possible through the generous support of our partner, HII. A big thanks to HII, and a great partnership along those lines.
Just a note before I introduce Admiral Pitts today. This session comes after two really good discussions recently, one with the Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Franchetti, which you can watch. That sits on our website and on YouTube as well. Another most recently is with Congressman Mike Waltz and Senator Kelly from Arizona on the naval industrial base, which also sits online. And will be followed in November, and we’ll provide more information shortly, it’s a sit-down discussion with Admiral Kilby, the vice chief of naval operations.
But today we’re delighted to be joined by Vice Admiral James Pitts. Vice Admiral Pitts assumed the role of deputy chief of naval operations for warfighting requirements and capabilities, N9, in December of 2023. I am not going to go through all of your accomplishments, they are long and impressive. But let me just say a few things here. At sea, Admiral Pitts has served aboard several ships, including the USS Grayling, Hammerhead, Rickover, and Tucson, among many others. In addition, Vice Admiral Pitts served as director of warfare integration on the staff of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. He’s a graduate from the U.S. Naval Academy. I’m not going to publicly say what year, but recently. He also holds a master’s degree from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School.
So thank you very much, Admiral Pitts, for joining us today. And now, to lead the discussion, I’m going to hand this over to Rear Admiral Ray Spicer. He’s the chief executive officer and publisher of the U.S. Naval Institute. Rear Admiral Spicer completed a very successful career in the U.S. Navy. During his time at sea, for example, he completed eight deployments, including combat operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan.
One final comment, for those of you who would like to ask questions that are in the room, please make sure you do that with a QR code which you can see on the screen in front of you. And Ray, sitting on the stage, will have access to those questions on his iPad. And for those of you online in real time, same issue on the website. You can ask questions, and they will come to Ray on his iPad. So with that, I will hand this over to Admiral Spicer. Over to you.
Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spicer, USN (Ret.): Thanks, Seth. And I’d also like to thank CSIS for being a great partner with the U.S. Naval Institute. And I’d also like to thank HII for your tremendous sponsorship. And Jon Rodgers is here today. So thanks to HII for supporting the Maritime Security Dialogue Series. So we’re very appreciative of that.
And then, finally, I want to thank Admiral Pitts – Admiral Jimmy Pitts, for being here with us today. We appreciate you escaping from the building so you can spend some time with us. I’m sure – I’m sure it’s a pleasure to be out of the building for once.
Vice Admiral James E. Pitts: It is. (Laughter.)
RADM Spicer: I want to start off with your role as the deputy CNO for warfighting requirements and capabilities. And in particular, in light of the CNO’s NAVPLAN, which was recently released. And if you’re not familiar with the NAVPLAN, it’s heavily focused on getting more players on the field in the near term, and it’s all about delivering more value from the Navy that we have, while we continue to pursue the Navy that we need. So that’s kind of a very broad summary of the NAVPLAN. But I’d like to ask you, Admiral Pitts, how it affects your role as the N9.
VADM Pitts: Yeah. Thank you, Ray. And, first and foremost, I want to thank CSIS and the Naval Institute for inviting me to get me out of the Pentagon. (Laughter.) And, two, for the opportunity to – you know, to have the discussion today.
So, to go with your question, so at the beginning of the year CNO Franchetti released America’s War Fighting Navy, which really was her vision and the priorities for our Navy. And the priorities were warfighting, so build combat credible capability, warfighters, you know, build and strengthen our Navy teams, and then the foundation that supports it. So build trust, align resources, and ultimately be ready. And as the N9, I fit squarely in that warfighting priority as, you know, building those enduring capabilities that we need to meet potential adversaries.
But three weeks ago, as you mentioned, the CNO rolled out the updated NAVPLAN, which is strategic guidance to the Navy. And it builds on the America’s War Fighting Navy vision and priorities. And it really has two strategic ends: To improve our readiness to be able to face potential high-end conflict in 2027 and build the enduring Navy advantages that we need from now into the future. The means to accomplish those ends are two mutually reinforcing thrusts or avenues.
The first is the P33 targets that the CNO identified as here are some critical areas that we can make quick – relatively quick gains to improve our readiness by 2027. That’s the P33 targets. The other means is to continue work that was established in CNO Gilday’s 2022 Navigation Plan to identify those key capabilities and key enablers that align to the Joint Warfighting Concept, and key battles for advantage, and help us build that enduring advantage from now through the future.
And so I fit in both the P33 targets. Of those seven targets that, you know, you’ve probably already discussed and the CNO discussed in the rollout, I own two of them. In scaling robotic and autonomous systems, and getting those operationally into the hands of the warfighters and to our fleet commanders so that they use robotic and autonomous systems. The other one is to enhance our training capability, invest in warfighter competency through the use of live, virtual, and constructive training, which allows then our sailors to be able to train at a higher level, at an integrated level using live, virtual, and constructive so that we’re better prepared to face that integrated fight that we will potentially face in the future. And it’s an effort to make sure that we still maintain the best-trained sailors in the world, which we have today. That’s on the P33 targets.
Then, on the enduring advantages and those critical capabilities, they continue the efforts that had started: long-range fires, how we shoot; counter-C5ISRT, how we maneuver; terminal defense, how we defend ourselves; and contested logistics, how we sustain ourselves, these capabilities. What is new in this NAVPLAN update is nontraditional sea denial, which is how we deny others – other people’s use of the sea. And as N9, I own the long-range fires, the nontraditional sea denial, and terminal defense on that aspect.
Those key capabilities are enabled by four key enablers: live, virtual, and constructive training, mutually reinforcing from the P33 targets of how we train; the naval operational architecture, how we communicate; artificial intelligence, how we outthink; and then robotic and autonomous systems, how we scale. And so those two are mutually reinforcing with the P33 targets.
And what is also new on that enhance part is how we integrate and synchronize those key capabilities and enablers better, aligning to how we’re going to fight and those critical kill chains. And so by integrating and synchronizing, we can better identify where are our true gaps across those kill webs and then pull the right levers to invest in as we move forward. And that is an update also to the NAVPLAN.
So as you can see, I fit into a lot of the warfighting capabilities, the P33 targets from this NAVPLAN, and continuing in this NAVPLAN those enhanced capabilities that we must build for our Navy now and into the future.
RADM Spicer: Great. Well, thank you very much for that.
As the N9, you pretty much see it all in the E-ring. You’ve got all the warfare domains. You got – you think about air, sea, subsurface, IW, cyber, everything, and then you’re responsible for integrating all of that and delivering priorities that then need to be funded. So it’s kind of where the magic happens, is the N9 in the building, so we thank you for that.
If we’re – if we’re looking at the NAVPLAN, on the longer-term side of the NAVPLAN there’s a – there is an identification of a need for a 381-ship Navy. And as budgets go, the budgets that we’re seeing now – 3 to 5 percent growth in the budget annually – we’re not going to get to a 381-ship Navy. And there are some who would say we need 20 percent more budget to achieve that. So how are you thinking about that on the longer term as the N9?
VADM Pitts: Well, it’s one of the challenges that we face, and part of my job is to work through said challenge, right? I will say the NAVPLAN specifically – CNO Franchetti in the NAVPLAN specifically addresses that this NAVPLAN is rightfully focused on near-term readiness and improving our capabilities so that we are ready for potential combat in 2027. But this enhancing the warfighting advantage aspect is also that longer-term focus of how we build the future Navy fleet and the capabilities that go along with it. Working in tandem with my fellow DCNOs – my N7, who develops the force design of our future, and we’ll continue to iterate through campaigns of learning through that force design – and by focusing now with the realities of kind of where we sit fiscally over, you know, the last few years, where we sit with our industrial base capacity right now, but knowing that we still have a requirement based on the National Defense Strategy and the approved defense planning scenarios to achieve a 381-ship Navy and the appropriate mix that goes along with it, then part of our job is to continue advocating for the Navy the nation needs. And it fits perfectly within, you know, our Title 10 responsibilities to be prepared for prompt and sustained combat operations incident to sea and to conduct operations that support national security initiatives and our prosperity.
RADM Spicer: Yeah. Great. Thank you.
It’s kind of a tall order to do the job that you do because part of the job, as I understand it, is you have to be able to predict the future threat. And in this case, a big, big part of that is the PRC and what’s going on there. And then you have to place bets against that future threat, hoping that your predictions are roughly accurate. But today we’re facing near-term threats at the same time. So if you’re looking at the Red Sea or the war in Ukraine, those are near-term, lower-end comparatively, but also big cost drivers. So how do you balance all that, placing the future bets against what you’re going to need way down the road versus what you need today?
VADM Pitts: Well, I guess part of that balance is the requirements process itself, starting from what is – what is it that we have in our baseline, so what are those key capability gaps to meet potential future threats. And that’s part of where we derive some of the requirements for even current activities and our future Navy.
And it is a team effort, right, that we have the right experts from the threat side, from ONI and DIA aspect; we have the right experts from our acquisition community; and then our – you know, our requirements community in developing these requirements. We work with industry on establishing some of the requirements to make sure that what we’re asking for is actually achievable and can be produced in a reasonable time, assuming it’s a material solution.
And generally, what we do is we say – we set for the realistic highest threat which we think will cover some of those lower-end threats. And what we’ve been seeing in the Red Sea over the last almost year is that our surface ships, our airplanes have been performing superbly in being able to meet the threat that’s being presented by the Houthis. So I count that as a win, and my job is to not screw it up and, as we keep moving forward, set the right requirements.
RADM Spicer: Yeah.
VADM Pitts: (Laughs.)
RADM Spicer: We’re going to talk more about the Red Sea. And you know, there’s been lots of discussion about the cost curve and are we on the wrong side of the cost curve; I’m not going to go there because I – you know, what price do you put on sailors’ lives? So –
VADM Pitts: Right.
RADM Spicer: But I know there’s lots of activity ongoing right now to see about kind of making that cost curve a little bit more equal, if you will.
But I want to shift right now. I know the budget isn’t part of necessarily your role, but you have to think about it because, you know, we can’t afford everything. So we’re in a scenario right now where the nation needs to recapitalize the Navy leg of the nuclear triad. So that’s the ballistic missile submarine, Columbia-class, to replace the Ohio-class. And that happened in the ’70s, ’80s, and ’90s, essentially, but the budget isn’t representative of what it was like in the – say, the ’80s, where we were seeing 7 percent or so increase in budget year over year. We’re not seeing that today; 2010 to 2020, the budget was relatively flat. Today, we’re seeing operations and support costs 2 ½ percent above inflation. We’re on this trajectory of defense spending that’s going to get us to about 2 percent of GDP. Which is – if we get there, it’s going to be the lowest level since the 1920s. So the question is, is there a disconnect between the National Security Strategy goals and the resources needed to deliver that strategy? And how are you dealing with that, as the deputy CNO for warfighting requirements?
VADM Pitts: So, Ray, first I would say what we’ve been developing in our budgets that are being submitted do support the National Defense Strategy. We would like – as a Navy – we would like to see a little bit more resources available to help us grow and expand our Navy, as articulated in the NAVPLAN and our shipbuilding plans. But given where we are – and in the NAVPLAN, the CNO also articulates that the current priorities are readiness, capability, and then capacity, in that order. And so we’re focusing on readiness. And our ’25 budget that is being worked on fully funds the readiness that – the fleet that we have.
The capability, or all those things that we work on in the N9, and N2 and (N)6, information warfare, and N4, is logistics, but the number one capability is the Columbia-class submarine. So that we – that is the highest priority amongst capability, in that that is our Navy’s contribution to the strategic deterrent mission of the United States, closely followed by TACAMO and some recap that we have to do there, and our NC3 apparatus, at N2 and (N)6. So inside capability there’s, you know, a priority. And Columbia is at the very top.
RADM Spicer: Yeah. OK. Thank you. CNO was recently here at CSIS. Talked about the NAVPLAN. When she was here, she mentioned that she needed a budget of, say, 3 to 5 percent above inflation in order to accomplish her goals. So how do you start to go after the CNO’s goals when you’re both under resourced and, on top of that, throw in the fact that we’re in a CR. Now, I know CRs are not foreign to us, unfortunately. But can you talk a little bit about how you’re addressing that, and what the impact is of the CR?
VADM Pitts: Yeah. Yeah. So, yes, as the CNO said, to achieve the 381-ship Navy we recognize that we need about 3 to 5 percent above inflation in order to be able to resource that. We also need the industrial capacity to be able to produce a navy of that size. And one of the ways – and so I said before, and I’ll kind of reiterate, it’s how we continue to advocate and raise awareness for what the Navy needs in order to be the – to meet the requirements that are facing us, and to be that critical sea aspect of the joint warfighting force, and how we enable the rest of the joint force from the sea by bringing our sea control aspects to it.
The secretary of the Navy has been a tremendous advocate and has, you know, unveiled, a number of months ago, his Maritime Statecraft Initiative to push a whole-of-government issue, looking at where we stand as a maritime nation and our capabilities for our Navy, also for our merchant marine capabilities, and where we might need to improve as a nation through Maritime Statecraft Initiative. So it’s – that’s part of the advocacy. So then we have to deal with the reality of, you know, for the 14th year out of the past 15 years, we’re starting the fiscal year off with a continuing resolution.
And, you know, a continuing resolution, it really just means that you’re kind of slower out of the gate because there may be a mismatch in, you know, what was – what’s being put forward with the president’s budget and the funding that you had last year. And this year is no different. There is a mismatch. There’s misalignment amongst the appropriations, because there might be some new starts in some things. There’s places where we’re ramping up production capacity, in the Navy’s case predominantly in our critical weapons procurements. And so the longer the CR goes, the longer it takes to get started in ramping up those capabilities, the longer it takes to get new starts moving. And that’s just a couple of examples. So it becomes very inefficient to execute the plan that was in place.
RADM Spicer: Yeah. Thank you.
Just a reminder for our audience here to use the QR code if you have questions that you want to start firing away. And then, for our viewers that are virtual, you should be able to do your questions or submit questions via the website. So I’m sure you all have great questions teed up for Admiral Pitts. I already see some coming in, sir, so.
VADM Pitts: Ok.
RADM Spicer: I want to shift topics a little bit and talk about lessons learned. I think one of the benefits – and despite the fact that there’s conflict – but one of the benefits is we’re seeing some pretty innovative technology in use today. And while what’s going on in the Red Sea and what’s going on in Russia-Ukraine are very different types of conflicts, there’s lots of similarity. And one of the similarities is the use of unmanned vehicles, relatively inexpensive vehicles, that are changing the way nations wage war. So for, you know, a very limited amount of cost, they’re having great impact.
And, you know, a good example is in the Ukraine, the use of unmanned surface vessels as weapons. And they’ve essentially wiped out a third of the Russian Black Sea fleet without, you know, a navy, essentially. So the question is, are we learning from these conflicts in how we might adopt some of these technologies in our own warfighting, as you think of the way forward?
VADM Pitts: Yeah. Absolutely. Ray, yeah, we are – we’re learning from the Russia-Ukraine aspect, and the ability to employ robotic and autonomous systems in all domains. We see it in the air. We see it on the surface. And, in fact, I would say, because we’ve learned that lesson, we’ve done two major things. One, as documented in the NAVPLAN, we stood up a nontraditional sea denial NAVPLAN implementation team – that’s being led by N95, here in the front row – where we’re taking some of those lessons from Ukraine and applying it to our own capabilities in order to deny an adversary use of the sea that they want to use.
We also have learned and realized we need to adapt faster to some of the challenges that we see. And so we stood up a Disruptive Capabilities Office earlier – I guess, late last year, early this year, building on the success that we had already started with the Unmanned Task Force of being able to rapidly identify some capability gaps or pieces of a key operational problem that the fleet brings up to us, and then swarm the problem using all key personnel from requirements side, from technology side, from acquisition, contracts, industry, et cetera, to get a solution that, in the Unmanned Task Force realm, was predominantly unmanned or robotic and autonomous. We’ve scaled it to the Disruptive Capabilities Office to go beyond just unmanned, but that’s the thrust – to rapidly swarm a problem and try and get a solution delivered to the fleet, definitely within two years, and faster if at all possible. And have had some success there.
And so that’s another example of how we’ve learned from what we’re seeing in the current events. And then in the Red Sea, we’re learning – we’ve learned how to get data off the ships faster. We’ve learned how to turn that data faster, so that we can make adjustments to either tactics, techniques, or adjustments to how you set up your system, to make sure that we’re better prepared for the next thing, as we watch our adversaries adjust their own tactics. So, it’s a nice move-countermove that we’re learning how to adapt much quicker.
RADM Spicer: Yeah. A race who can apply analytics more rapidly. And, you know, as far as the OODA loop goes, if it’s faster than the OODA loop. And I know there’s lots of activity. You mentioned Task Force 59. There’s activity in SOUTHCOM. There’s the Replicator Initiative. SecDef just came out and said countering UAS is going to be the priority for Replicator 2. So lots of activity going on there. That’s great.
Questions are coming in. So I think I’m going to pivot a little bit. I’ve got one question here from Caleb Thompson, U.S. Navy. It says: How does AI, artificial intelligence, play a role in the new NAVPLAN, as well as the priorities of the N9?
VADM Pitts: Right. Well, thank you for the question, Caleb.
So artificial intelligence is one of our key enablers – our critical key enablers that help support those key capabilities that we develop. And it’s enduring. So every one of our domains at the TICOM level has taken on efforts to incorporate AI into some aspect of their systems. The one I’m most familiar with is the submarine aspect, in that we’re using AI to help improve – at the tactical level – help improve our sonar operators to be able to detect, track, and classify targets. That’s at the tactical level.
We’re moving to the operational level of how we use AI in more operational decision making, battle management aids, et cetera. Both at each domain level, and will play in, in the how we fight from the mock P33 – the Maritime Operations Center P33 target. So it’s a piece of enabling all of our key capabilities. While I’m not the DCNO directly responsible, I use AI in just about every one of the platforms that we produce. And whether it’s relatively simple on the algorithm side, and as we continue to advance it’ll be more advanced.
RADM Spicer: Got it. Thank you. I’m going to start hitting the questions that are coming in, so please get them in if you – if you’ve got them. I do see some piling in here. This one is from a guy whose name rings a bell, Vice Admiral, Retired, Pete Daly, who happened to be the guy I relieved at the Naval Institute.
He says: When you receive requirements inputs from your platform sponsors, how do you overcome potential bias in favor of building more of what we are building now? How specifically do you, as requirements and capabilities czar, ensure we are innovating and fully embracing different concepts, futures, and solutions?
VADM Pitts: Yeah. Well, thank you, Admiral Daly.
So the requirements process itself, while the platform sponsor is the one who tees up here’s what I need, we basically put it through the ringer of a collaborative O6 level. Then a ringer of a one- and two-star level review to make sure that we’re actually moving forward with the right thing. And then ultimately, as the N9 responsible, as the CNO’s been – you know, delegated the authority to me to approve requirements, with the option for the CNO or vice chief to actually be the one that that heads it. But it’s all collaborative.
It’s all working with the entire team to ensure that we’re not, one, just blindly following a path that doesn’t necessarily make sense. Two, that, once again, the solution that’s being presented is actually achievable, that there’s a clear delta outcome to what this requirement will produce to – back to our capability gaps. And, invariably, a lot of these require some joint work that also, you know, goes in to, whether it’s the analysis of alternatives or the sufficiency reviews, et cetera.
So the whole process is built to help make sure that we aren’t blindly stovepiping something, one. Two, in the NAVPLAN, the CNO has specifically charged us to think, act, and operate differently, and to look at different ways of accomplishing that same delta outcome, or a similar delta outcome. A good example is the nontraditional sea denial, where we’re building capabilities that accomplish the same mission of what, say, your classic naval mine might do, but with different capabilities and platforms to accomplish that same mission.
RADM Spicer: Excellent. Thank you. All right, questions are coming in. I want to talk a minute about deterrence, and the Navy’s role in deterrence. And in particular, in the Red Sea. And now, as the N9, you essentially have to sell requirements and capabilities to folks who will support it. So the scenario in the Red Sea, though, is a challenging one, because the Navy is essentially there. They’re doing wonderfully. They’re playing defense primarily. There is some offense involved. But if you think about why our Navy is there, and why our allies and partners are there with us, it is to ensure the free flow of commerce through the –through the Red Sea.
It’s down 90 percent, the flow of commerce through the Red Sea. So does that present challenges to you, when you’re trying to sell, you know, why we need a navy, why we need more – why we need more requirements, when, essentially, we’re very successful, tactically – highly successful – but we’re not doing so great on the strategic side because we’re not deterring, essentially. Does that present problems for you, or challenges for you as you try to sell requirements and capabilities down the road?
VADM Pitts: No. Not really.
RADM Spicer: OK. (Laughter.)
VADM Pitts: Yeah. (Laughs.) I think, you know, what’s happening in the Red Sea actually is helping, you know, us show why we need a navy or – and I would say, even in combination with our Marine Corps partners – a naval – why we need naval forces to do what Title 10 tells us we’re supposed to do. And we’re executing it. I think part of your question is a policy question that isn’t really in my lane. And so – but what our Navy does every day, day-in and day-out, and what is happening in the Red Sea right now, to me, is just more of that advocacy of, you know, why a navy exists for the American people.
RADM Spicer: Yeah. OK, great. We’ve got lots of industry represented, both here in person and virtually.
Let me ask this question that just came in. Bob Dishman, Sierra Nevada Corporation: Disruptive Capabilities Office has been difficult for industry to engage. Seems more like a closed enclave for a few instead of a broad market research tool. Is there room for increased industry engagement? And I would just pile on top of that is, are there ways that industry can help you in your role as the N9?
VADM Pitts: Yeah. So thank you for the question. Yes, absolutely, there’s room for industry to engage with the Disruptive Capabilities Office. The director of the Disruptive Capabilities Office is Mr. Michael Stewart. Feel free to reach out directly to him. (Laughs.) You know, he works directly for the vice chief. But I’m in that C2 lane, if you will. So and if – and if for some reason you’re not – you feel like you’re not getting active returns from Michael, just reach out to me. We can work it out. Because that is part of what Disruptive Capabilities Office is supposed to do, is to engage with industry on these once the problem has been identified. And potential solutions to – industry is a key piece of it.
I think, to the second part of your question of how can – how can industry help? I view it as a two-way street, that we work collaboratively with industry. And we should do it on the upfront side of requirements, in stride. If things start, you know, falling behind, we need to have a discussion about whether it’s the big-R warfighting requirements or some of the little-R system specifications or tech authority aspects. And it’s a team effort between industry, the requirements side, our acquisition community, that we all work together. Because working together is the only way we’re going to accomplish the NAVPLAN goals that the CNO has put in front of us. And, you know, how we can help industry and how industry can help us should be a continuous conversation.
RADM Spicer: Great.
Well, speaking of working together, I got a question about collaboration as you were answering that. Captain Dan’l Steward, U.S. Navy, retired: Can you speak to the degree of collaboration between your directorate and those who wargame strategic future naval engagements?
VADM Pitts: Yeah. Thank you for that question.
Yes, we work incredibly closely together. As I said, my fellow deputy chief of naval operations for N3, (N)5, and (N)7, and N7 is the organization that works our force design, that works the wargaming and experimentation that we’ll do to support our force design efforts – force design 2045, and as we look at what that future Navy needs to look like, building off the NAVPLAN, where we know that we have to incorporate robotic and autonomous systems and build a more hybrid fleet. So that collaboration is very tight, because from the force design then flows battle force structure assessments, which then flows shipbuilding plans, which then flows also the capabilities that we need to put on those ships, and that mix of platforms for our future Navy.
RADM Spicer: Thank you.
One from Peter Ong from Naval News. And Peter submitted several questions. Thank you, Peter. There is concern that the U.S. Navy will not have enough VLS cells for Tomahawk with the retirement of the SSGNs. The Virginia payload module is a slow remedy start. Why hasn’t the U.S. Navy built Arsenal ships, more Mark 70 payload modules, armed LUSVs, or bought adaptable deck launchers?
VADM Pitts: Peter, thank you for that question. In the near term, I will tell you that we have plenty of VLS cells for the Tomahawk missiles that we have in inventory, both on the surface and under the sea. But I readily admit we are losing some significant capability when we decommission our SSGNs in the coming years. And we’re exploring options to what some follow-on capability may or may not be. And, as you point out, in the interim the replacement capability is building the Virginia payload module Virginia-class submarines. And we’ll build a number of them to help mitigate the loss of the SSGN.
And on the surface side, we’re continually looking and exploring our family of unmanned systems on the surface side, from small all the way up to large, and how the payloads that we put in each and every one of them may contribute to replacing or providing some additional VLS capability. But in the near term, we have enough VLS cells for the munitions that we have in inventory.
RADM Spicer: Great. Thank you.
All right, we’re going to take you to the Arctic now. David Redpath, Canadian Joint Warfare Centre: What do you see as the most interesting capabilities required for the Arctic area of operations?
VADM Pitts: David, thank you for the question. As a submariner, I will show my bias a little bit in saying that our undersea capability is interesting. It may not be the most interesting, but it is interesting in facing, you know, the potential adversaries that may want to operate on or under the Arctic. But the joint force still has to have all the capabilities it needs to fly, sail, operate in Arctic environments. And we can’t – we can’t lose sight of that. And I believe that, as a joint force, we’re still developing, you know, capabilities to execute what’s required.
RADM Spicer: Thank you.
One from Benjamin Massengale, Stimson Center: What is your level of collaboration with your equivalents with the other services to meet joint requirements and potential cover NAVPLAN – or, potentially cover NAVPLAN objectives?
VADM Pitts: Yeah. Thank you for that question. I would say we have a pretty close relationship with our – with my service counterparts. In my previous job as director of warfare integration, I was the Navy representative to the Joint Capabilities Boards. And now I support the vice chief at the JROC level. But a perfect example is between the Department of Navy and the Department of Air Force.
We started a joint long-range fires office, where it’s collaboration with the Department of Air Force – Space Force, and the Air Force, and then the Navy, and Marine Corps on how we collectively partner to bring to life our long-range fires kill webs. We have recently, as part of that work, have also added the Army, and the long-range fires capabilities that they bring. So that is really a tangible example of how we’re collaborating across the services to execute the joint warfighting concept and bring to life the joint key battle for advantage of long-range fires.
RADM Spicer: Thank you.
One from Jim Hossell (ph), U.S. Navy: How do you foresee seabed warfare playing a role in the Navy’s future strategy?
VADM Pitts: Mmm hmm. I see it playing a role. We have a number of sub seabed warfare efforts ongoing. Most of them are at a classification that we can’t talk about in – you know, in this venue. But it will be – I fully expect it to be a part of our future. And in a sense, it’s really a – could be a subset of either long-range fires or nontraditional sea denial.
RADM Spicer: OK. Thank you.
I want to shift topics to a little bit about operational availability and how that influences, or how that is calculated in your role in developing requirements and capabilities. So the example is, you know, we have 50 SSNs, but at any one time 19-20 of them are in some kind of maintenance or are waiting to go into maintenance. So does operational availability weigh in to your calculations about what we need for future requirements? Is that a consideration, I guess, is the question.
VADM Pitts: Ray, yes, absolutely. It either becomes one of the key performance parameters or a key, you know, system attribute of the operational availability built – you know, designed and built from the ground up to improve that over what it may be replacing.
Also, one of the P33 targets specifically is ready our platforms, with the target goal of achieving essentially 80 percent operational readiness of our aircraft, submarines, and ships. And we have a number of efforts with our current fleet attacking that problem to improve the operational availability.
So new requirements work to improve operational availability. The existing fleet – we are doing a number of performance-to-plan efforts to improve the operational availability of our existing platforms.
RADM Spicer: Right.
VADM Pitts: And you know, the one that we like to discuss of the recently – over the previous two to three years – was improving aircraft, fighter aircraft, you know, uptime and availability from somewhere in the 50 to 60s to over 80 percent.
RADM Spicer: Right.
VADM Pitts: And similar efforts are moving forward in both the undersea community and the surface community, and we have a specific target that the CNO has charged us to get after, so.
RADM Spicer: Yeah. Yeah, she talked about that when she was here at CSIS, the 80 percent number, of –
VADM Pitts: Yeah.
RADM Spicer: – combat surge capability to support this, you know, get more players on the field.
VADM Pitts: Get more players on the field. That’s one of –
RADM Spicer: So I’ve got time ask one more question if you have one coming in. If not, I’m going to talk about one that you and I discussed previously that is about the planning, programming, budgeting, and execution – PPB&E – reform, which, as you know, there’s a commission that talked about PPB&E reform. We’ve been talking about it for a number of years. It needs to improve. I’m just wondering, you know, they came out – the commission came out with several recommendations, and – but I’m wondering if you’re starting to see any of that playing out in the requirements process or if it’s still too early to tell. Any thoughts on that?
VADM Pitts: Right. Thanks, Ray.
I would say it’s – for its impact on the requirements process, it’s still a little early. But I will tell you the Department of the Navy is moving out on at least exploring a couple of the recommendations and building options to look at a couple of the recommendations from the PPB team.
Those two are: budget restructure, so how we might restructure the budget – you know, the appropriations and line items in a more efficient or warfighting support role – some options are being looked at there; and then budget line item consolidation is also being explored. It’s still early in the process, but the Department of the Navy is moving out on some of those recommendations from the reform team.
RADM Spicer: All right. Thank you.
All right, I’ve got the last question here from Franca Limner (ph), MIT D.C. office: What are the opportunities and hurdles in working with NATO allies to reach the capabilities needed for a potential direct conflict, looking at, for example, icebreakers or AI technologies?
VADM Pitts: So I would – NATO is not my forte, and so I would – you know, these types of questions probably should go to NAVEUR.
But I will say I was just recently in – at STRIKFORNATO doing a visit as part of the REP(MUS), you know, unmanned systems exercise in Portugal. I will just tell you that the NATO team is incredibly excited by how well they’re collaborating together. They’re excited by the new members who have joined NATO. And so I – my takeaway was very positive.
I think everyone knows the inherent challenges of – that all members have to agree to most actions moving forward, but they seem to be working through it just fine. And any deeper questions I would defer to NAVEUR.
RADM Spicer: Yeah. I think more broadly, though, we were talking previously is about the importance of working with our allies and partners.
VADM Pitts: Oh, absolutely.
RADM Spicer: You know, we can’t do it our – alone. So both working with allies and partners and with the joint force, you know, we’re a piece of it, but it’s not just all Navy.
VADM Pitts: Yeah, it’s not just us. I completely agree.
RADM Spicer: Yeah.
VADM Pitts: And our NATO allies definitely bring lots of capability, and all of our allies and partners bring capability that we know that we will rely on should conflict arise.
RADM Spicer: Sir.
Well, questions are still coming in, but we’re, unfortunately, out of time. And that’s the sign of a great conversation, when we have more questions than we have time to answer.
So, again, I want to thank CSIS for the great partnership. I want to thank HII for the great sponsorship. But mostly I want to thank you, Admiral Pitts. And if you would please join me in a round of applause, I’d appreciate it. (Applause.)
VADM Pitts: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)

20,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/region-aflame-october-7-year-later,Unknown,"October 7, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS event hosted on October 7, 2024. Watch the full video here.
Jon B. Alterman: Good afternoon and good evening. I'm Jon Alterman, senior vice president, the Brzezinski Chair of Global Security and Geostrategy, and the director of the Middle East Program at CSIS. We're convening today to discuss the solemn events of October 7th, a day that kicked off a tremendous amount of violence and suffering in the Middle East a year ago, creating deepening trauma for communities throughout the region.
To discuss these events, but more importantly, to analyze their impacts on the current and future trajectory of the region, I'm joined by three colleagues. Our goal today is to have an interactive conversation from different perspectives to understand how the events of October 7th last year helped shape the region and where the region's going.
I'm joined first by my colleague, Natan Sachs, director of the Center for Middle East Policy and a senior fellow of the Foreign Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. I am also joined by my friend and colleague, Dan Byman, who is a senior fellow with the Warfare, Irregular Threats, and Terrorism Program at CSIS, a professor at Georgetown University, and the director of its Security Studies Program. I am also joined by Professor Dana El Kurd, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Richmond and a senior non-resident fellow at the Arab Center in Washington. All of us come to this with a tremendous amount of focus, but also with very different backgrounds and perspectives. I'm really interested in understanding how we can learn from each other as we look forward to the future of the region. Dana, why don't you start?
Dana El Kurd: Thank you so much for having me. I had a question for Natan on Israeli society and how it's metabolizing some of these changes and shifts in the conflict. Yesterday, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Israel was defending itself on seven fronts against “the enemies of civilization."" Could you tell us more about where Israeli society stands on this? What's public opinion showing about their appetite for negotiations or continued conflict? I'm trying to understand the societal component of all of this.
Natan Sachs: Thanks, Dana. It's good to be with you all despite the day. Today, especially, is an extremely solemn day—certainly in Israel—and a day of real profound mourning. Not to diminish in any way anyone else’s suffering, but of course in Israel, the events from a year ago are still very much being processed. People have referred to Israelis, Palestinians, and now Lebanese as being in some post-traumatic state. The truth is they're not post-traumatic. They're very much still in the midst of a trauma, and that's very much true of Israelis as well, who are still living and reliving the events a year ago. Israelis sometimes refer to today as day 367 of October, in part because some of the hostages are still in captivity, and in part because the war continues. Israeli society, writ large, still feels a very profound sense of vulnerability in a way that would surprise its neighbors that view it as very strong and powerful.
Israelis, especially given the events of October 7th, feel extremely vulnerable. There’s a lot of fear on a very personal basis—something that is often a fuel of civil wars. I used to say that Palestinians and now Lebanese certainly feel the same way in different ways, and that is very dangerous. That kind of fear fuels these kinds of conflicts. This sense that if you do not defend yourself, strike first, and protect yourself with everything you have, your loved ones could suffer a fate like that of October 7th a year ago. That means that Israeli society is very risk averse.
The idea of negotiations is certainly open. There's a clear majority of Israelis in favor of negotiating—even with Hamas—for a ceasefire in return for the hostages, despite the severe costs in their mind. But there is also a deep aversion to negotiating over anything that they think would risk Israel again, including a Palestinian state at this stage. There are fears that a Palestinian state in the West Bank would mean that the major civilian populations in central Israel would face the same kind of crisis as those who neighbored Gaza.
You mentioned Netanyahu. His rhetoric is often bellicose. I often find it offensive. He is deeply unpopular in Israel and is seen as responsible for October 7th for being the one at the helm. It's not that Israelis are against the aims of the war, especially the two clear aims in Gaza—which are bringing down Hamas as the governing power there, which has mostly been achieved, and returning the hostages—or degrading the rest of the Iranian-backed “Axis of Resistance,” particularly Hezbollah. However, you see a lot of disunity over his tactics, means, and what as many Israelis think is him prioritizing his own political fate.
I can think of an example from today, then I'll end there to let others speak. Today, there are two main ceremonies commemorating October 7th in Israel. One is state sponsored. Then, the families immediately objected to the idea that this government, the same government that was the government on October 7th, would organize it. So, there is a second ceremony that they call “the national one” or other names, organized mostly by hostage families and bereaved families from October 7th.
Today, on a real day of grieving—and I think we see it abroad too—one of the first casualties of war is empathy and appreciation for the sanctity of life, writ large any life. That is certainly true from my vantage point. I see it in people’s inability to accept a mourning for October 7th with demonstrations in front of memorial services, but not to evade the question, I think that's very true of Israeli society when looking at Gaza or others. They see the strategic objectives—sometimes correctly—but have a deficit of empathy still stemming from that trauma. It'll take a long time to recover from it, if it begins to recover. Only then can we think about productive negotiations, hopefully sooner than later.
Daniel Byman: Natan, can I push you a little bit on the Netanyahu question? A question I often get asked and frankly don't know the answer to is when you look at Israel's continuing operations, especially in Gaza, where it does seem that they've hit diminishing returns, at least militarily? How much of the war is continued because of Netanyahu's own political agenda versus a broader strategic concept?
Dr. Sachs: It's a very hard thing to answer, in part because it's within the mind of one man. He's so analyzed, reviled by so many, and adored by others that I'm usually rather skeptical of anyone who claims to know the true answer to what Netanyahu is exactly thinking. Let me partially evade your question but say the more important point here. If a leader, during a time of war and the deepest crisis a country has faced with many ramifications in terms of economics, international standing, and more, has lost the trust and the faith of at least half the population, who are not sure that he is conducting things only for the best of the country and not his own political survival, he cannot function properly.
There is certainly the very strong and just suspicion that his own political survival is important, at least in part. I think he's come to the stage of leadership where he truly believes that any other leader would be extremely damaging to Israel. “The state is I,” the old French adage, right? That is a very dangerous stage of leadership. Not coincidentally, he's a very long-standing leader, and that's characteristic of it.
Dr. Alterman: Dan, let me ask you a question about Israeli strategy. I don't know the extent to which we can talk about it being Netanyahu's strategy or the Israeli government’s strategy. A year into this war, I've lost track of what a discrete concept of victory is on the Israeli side. As the war has spread into Lebanon, I don't know what victory in Lebanon looks like in any real military terms. As somebody who's thought a lot about fighting irregular warfare, is there something unique about this? Is there something misguided about the way Israelis are conceptualizing this?
Dr. Byman: I think we can go theater by theater and get different answers but let me really focus first on Gaza and then on Lebanon. In Gaza and in general, the goal seems to be to destroy capacity. With Hamas in Gaza, the goal is to make it so they have no military ability, but defining that in a very expansive sense. You could say Hamas as a military organization is shattered compared to what it was a year ago, but I think Israel wants to ensure that not only are they not a threat today, but they will also never be a threat. That's an exceptionally difficult bar, right? I don't actually know how you do that on a practical level. In Gaza, Israel seems to want to eradicate or destroy Hamas, but not do what the United States would say is necessary, which would be a mix of having lots of troops there so you can keep Hamas down and at the same time putting in place some sort of political structure that replaces Hamas.
As far as I can tell, Israel is kind of in whack-a-mole mode right now; it has a presence that goes after Hamas leadership. Hamas occasionally pops up, whether it's in a traditional stronghold or some part of Gaza where Israel has moved its presence away, and then Israel tries to suppress that presence there. Then, Hamas pops up somewhere else. This can go on for a long time. As Natan said, Israeli society is willing to bear significant costs and deal with very low risk thresholds, but to me, that’s not a winning strategy for the long term. I don't know what Israel gains or has gained in the last three or four months, and probably longer than that, from its presence in Gaza. Lebanon is very different, but there's a big question mark. Going back to capacity, Israel's goal is to make sure not only that Hezbollah won’t threaten it, but also that Hezbollah is unable to threaten it. Given Hezbollah’s vast rocket and missile arsenal, its skilled fighters, and its Iranian backing, that's exceptionally difficult.
Dr. Alterman: And the porosity of the borders.
Dr. Byman: And the porosity of its borders. The assumption is that whatever Hezbollah loses, Iran will eventually rebuild. In the last month, Israel has done a sustained series of operations against Hezbollah's leadership. Its military rank and file, its rocket launchers, and, more broadly, its arsenal have been far more effective than I would've said was likely. If you had asked me six months ago, I would've said that Israel would not be able to succeed to the degree it is. The question to me is, can Israel force Hezbollah to make significant concessions through force rather than through a broader deterrent threat? This is going to be difficult because Hezbollah can simply return. We saw this after 2006 where Hezbollah was supposed to leave the Israel-Gaza border and effectively didn't. As always, Hezbollah is a much harder problem than Hamas. There's a genuine question mark about what Israel's going to do in the long term there.
Dr. Alterman: Especially with the vacuum in Lebanese politics, which Hezbollah has been filling, and the vacuum in Palestinian politics, where the Palestinian Authority (PA) has been unable to move in.
Dr. Byman: That’s the huge question: who takes over? Dana, can I ask you to guide us on that one? Talk us through some of the Palestinian politics on all this.
Dr. El Kurd: To understand the current situation in Palestinian politics, I want to preface by noting polling that just came out a few days ago from the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research about, similar to what Natan was describing, the really vivid fear that Palestinians are living in during the aftermath of the last year of the war on Gaza. To Palestinians, this has been described as a genocide, and there are vivid fears this conflict will continue in the West Bank. There are fears of ethnic cleansing also happening in the West Bank. In the latest polling, 77 percent feared that the West Bank would be next in this level of violence.
This past year has been an unfathomable level of violence to Palestinians. The way this is described, perhaps a little bit in the media, is as if Gaza is some sort of periphery, given the fragmentation of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. However, it's a sizable portion of the Palestinian body politics. For Palestinians, it's not seen as something happening on the periphery. Current Palestinian politics are based on this very real and growing fear that levels of violence will continue to escalate, and in the aftermath of October 7th, Palestinians are struggling with this kind of policy of fragmentation. There are many Palestinian stakeholders, such as Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, and elsewhere with different positionalities, but there isn't really a framework to incorporate all those different Palestinian stakeholders.
In the aftermath of October 7th and the level of destruction we saw in Gaza, there's an urgency to resolve this fragmentation issue that limits the ability and capacity of Palestinians to negotiate and put up a united front. There are many discussions happening in Palestinian civil society and attempts to organize to push beyond the Palestinian Authority/Hamas binary, and to largely push beyond the Oslo framework.
I could talk more about what those initiatives look like, but I think it's also important to note that we find ourselves in this kind of situation within Palestinian politics because even prior to October 7th and this last year, Hamas, Fatah, and the Palestinian Authority have had very little legitimacy in the Palestinian political space. This was some of the polling from before. Whether it's from the Palestinian Center or the Arab Barometer, a lot of the polling shows that neither Hamas nor Fatah achieved more than a 30 percent approval rating. In the latest polling, people were asked if parliamentary elections were held, which group would win? Fatah received 36 percent and Hamas only received 34 percent.
There is this palpable lack of legitimacy for all ongoing actors. That is the problem when we talk about what happens now, in the aftermath, and on whatever day after is supposed to come. Who will govern? That is the biggest problem. If we don't move beyond this legitimacy issue for all the ongoing structures and the political parties involved in those structures, then we'll continue to have similar issues, like spoilers and other actors taking advantage of this vacuum. I could speak more about some of the civil society initiatives if we go in that direction.
Dr. Sachs: I'd love to hear about those initiatives. The Palestinian Authority, led by Abbas, has been very lacking in legitimacy for a long time, and probably deservedly so, but it also seems almost impossible to see a clear alternative. Again and again in the polls I see Fatah and Hamas rated very, very low, but no one else is able to rival them. What are the chances of a third actor coming about? Or the chances of Fatah rejuvenating with different actors coming in or back in, and giving it a new energy that it used to have?
Dr. El Kurd: The problem, as you mentioned, is that these political parties have been stagnant. Part of the push from Palestinian civil society is to start the discussion about moving beyond the Palestinian Authority/Hamas framework, moving beyond the Oslo framework, and trying to possibly revitalize the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as an umbrella organization. These are the kinds of discussions and attempted initiatives that are ongoing. They also have to do with reviving party politics within these parties. Fatah has not organically fallen apart on its own in this stagnating way. Instead, it has to do with the fact that Fatah hasn't allowed young cadres to rise up in the party or to impact the party for quite some time. That's just one example.
Some of the initiatives that I was alluding to have taken off after October 7th. There's the Palestinian National Conference, which is this attempt to revive the PLO and bring together actors from all the different political parties, as well as those outside those political parties. Polling shows that there's a lot of support for national unity governments in Palestinian society. In fact, in the latest polling, it was the biggest priority for what should happen and what the Palestinian Authority should take part in after the war in Gaza, whenever it ends. But as you mentioned, the seriousness of these political parties to actually reinvigorate politics within their parties and allow for new faces to emerge is a problem that still remains.
The second thing is international buy-in for some of these initiatives. If there isn't support for an umbrella organization—whether it’s the PLO or we call it something else—that might incorporate Hamas as a junior partner, as has been discussed by some of the people involved in this initiative, or if there isn't support for Palestinian input on whatever the “day after” is going to be, and there's just continued discussions of different configurations of the status quo, then I worry that some of these initiatives don’t necessarily go very far.
If Palestinian politics remains as it is, where there isn't a lot of serious international support and engagement with some of the Palestinian civil society initiatives, we're going to see more armed tactics. We're going to see more armed conflict and the devolvement into violence. But if it is taken seriously in an ideal scenario, then we might see a revival of some sort of national unity government or umbrella organization that has the legitimacy to negotiate and return to nonviolent methods of conflict resolution.
Dr. Alterman: Dana, could I ask you and Natan a question? As I look at Palestinian-Israeli politics, each one seems to have a blocking third, whether it's Otzma Yehudit and other nationalist parties in Israel or Hamas with strong 30 percent support. You have religiously inflected groups that believe that this is not just between people, but that it's between people and God, and that it's about reclaiming holy land. It's one thing when you have small minorities that you have to manage. It feels to me, and correct me if I'm wrong, that you have these mirror images of about a third of the people on each side who are deeply nationalistic and religious and feel that it's national suicide to negotiate along the lines that Dana talked about. First, am I right in thinking that there is this religious nationalist blocking third on each side? Second how might the two-thirds, who are not in the blocking third, deal with the 30 percent who are? I'm not completely confident that it's a mirror image, but it feels very similar.
Dr. Sachs: On the Israeli side, I agree and disagree. The good news is that if you look at the religious national element, the ones who would put religion deeply intertwined with and inherent to the national cause, it's significantly less than 30 percent. If you look at Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, the two figureheads of the far right today, they have much less than 30 percent.
Dr. Alterman: They’re at 15 percent, right?
Dr. Sachs: At best, and now their polling is actually down. Many of the voters, especially of Ben-Gvir, are not necessarily of the religious national ilk. Technically, religious nationalists, or modern Orthodox, are slightly more than 10 percent of the population. Not all of them are necessarily hardcore nationalists, although most are. That's the good news. Of course, there are the ultra-Orthodox who are a very different group. They are not necessarily as nationalist, although in recent years, they are much more so than in the past. But their leadership is more complex than that. That's the good news. The good news is the blocking third is significantly less than a third of that kind. That's on the religious side.
There are two main impetuses for hawkishness among Israelis towards the Palestinian issue. One is the religious aspect. For someone like Smotrich, it's not a question of expediency or security. It's a question, as you said, of divine purpose—the whole purpose of this whole thing. It is about the land of Israel and the State of Israel within it. It has very little to do with other considerations.
There's a second consideration, security, and that often coincides with the national one. Even people who are attached to the national or religious idea, but less so, can be very attached to the security question. It is significantly more than 30 percent. It's easily more than half of the population who are now extremely risk averse and have lost patience with the suggestion that they should be taking profound risks with their family because people will be angry at them abroad.
Dr. Alterman: Last spring, a Pew poll last spring asked Israelis, ""Would a two-state solution deliver security?” Among Jewish Israelis, the number was 19 percent.
Dr. Sachs: Exactly. Let me stress this point. If you somehow convince Israelis magically that there would be a Palestinian state, but there would be zero added risk security-wise, which is impossible, although there are very big differences to what kind of risk you add, I think you could muster a majority with the right leadership, not today, and not in the next year or two or five, but eventually you could do it. That proposition is extremely hard to sell to Israelis, especially today. A two-state solution, or a Palestinian state, at this moment in time among Israelis is a non-starter. A non-starter. Once you introduce demilitarization, which was always part of the negotiations, and spell out what demilitarization might mean, it looks slightly different. With time, the right leadership, and a lot of luck, it may be easier to do.
To summarize, there's a big difference between religious or nationalist claims, which are strong. By the way, they're prevalent among many people who are not national religious. Many people on the left, even, feel a deep attachment to the land, et cetera. They just believe they should compromise on it, but it is a compromise for them. That is on one side. The second side is a security question. Especially after October 7th a year ago, that is an overwhelming argument, but it's one that our world of structured diplomacy and geopolitics can deal with at least. That is something one can discuss in some context. Not in the midst of a trauma, but if, hopefully, one can move past it and start recovering from it, it's not impossible to imagine.
Dr. Alterman: Dana, how do you feel about the blocking third?
Dr. El Kurd: We need to understand the polling around Hamas in a similar way as Natan described. This is not necessarily support for a religious view of the conflict. Support for Hamas does not necessarily equal a religious view of the conflict or a lack of space to compromise. I'm sure there are some elements of that among people who support Hamas. But whenever we see Hamas gaining in polls, it's usually support that's gained because of the failure of its opposite. There is a large element of that in the polling that we have to take into consideration. Another thing that we have to take into consideration is that the Palestinian stakeholders I was describing at the beginning are not just people in Gaza and the West Bank. Even the polls that we do have are more limited, and they don't get the full scope of where Palestinian politics stands today.
That being said, Hamas, especially in the aftermath of 2017, has tried to emphasize its role as a national movement and its willingness to compromise around national issues. They know that's where Palestinian society is at. They can't gain as much traction with religiously inflicted narratives as much as they can with nationally motivated narratives. You're right that there is some element in Palestinian society that is zero-sum, and the ongoing violence really increases this. The violence creates the conditions for zero-sum understandings of the conflict. It's less so because of Hamas or Islamic Jihad, and more because of how people are understanding, absorbing, and processing the last year.
That means that the space for negotiations is much smaller. Since before October 7th, a lot of us have been saying that if things went on that path and mass violence becomes the norm, the space for any kind of nonviolent resolution to the conflict becomes very narrow. So, I don't think it's necessarily just Hamas as a block. I think it's people who view this conflict as zero-sum as a result of the last year. That portion of the population has definitely increased.
Dr. Alterman: Thank you.
Dr. Byman: Jon, can I interrupt to ask you a question on the region? A very impressive Israeli diplomatic success is that the Arab partners that Israel has worked with, in some cases for years like Egypt, and in some cases more recently, have somewhat publicly stuck by Israel, at least in their actions. We are a year into this. No one here is saying the end is in sight. Is the support, or at least the quiet cooperation of Arab states, towards Israel something that's going to continue in the future? Is there a breaking point for them?
Dr. Alterman: There's cooperation on Iran issues, because under the current government of Iran and its behaviors, they feel they have a common cause with Israel. There's growing frustration on the Palestinian issue, not because they support Hamas, but to a country. All the governments in the region are hostile to Hamas as a popularly elected, Islamically inflected political movement that, as far as they're concerned, wants to push them from power in their own countries. But there is a sense in the region that Israelis believe that Arab lives are particularly cheap, and that's offensive. There is concern with public opinion that I see manifested. There's a certain sense in the public of a profound lack of Israeli respect, which I think frankly some Arab governments also practice with their own people, but this doesn't help legitimate what governments want to do with Israel.
The other piece of this that's really important—I would be interested in hearing Dana's perspective on this as well—is that, as a democracy, Israel has a pretty relentless timeline. It has an independent press and people are saying, ""Okay, so where's this going? That was last week. What about this week? Where's this going? When is this going to end?"" There's an insistence on accountability and on the refinement of policy. When it comes to the issue of cooperation or normalization with Israel, a lot of the leaders in the region think they have 40 years to play this out. For them, it doesn't matter what happens this week. They can park the issue for one year, five years. As far as they're concerned, their people aren't fighting and dying. They have other things going on. There's some frustration in the Gulf. They feel their main issue is diversifying their economies and attracting foreign investment, and this war is taking all the attention away from the good things they're doing and getting people agitated, on top of raising risks in the region.
But rather than breaking anything irretrievably, they’re likely to park things for quite some time. Don't forget, this is a region where the Saudis and the Iranians, after long being deeply hostile for years and years and years, threatening each other, shutting down embassies, and everything else, the Iranian president met with the Saudi foreign minister last week. People said, “Yeah, that's the right thing to have happen.” You can accelerate or you can deepen cooperation, but everyone has a much longer timeframe, and the people at the wheel now are likely to be the same people there in the future. Sultan bin Abdulaziz was the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia for 48 years. I'm not saying the current foreign minister is going to be there for 40 years, but it's certainly possible. The crown prince expects to be guiding Saudi foreign policy for decades to come. The ruler of the UAE, Mohamed bin Zayed, expects to be there for a long time. Everybody is playing a longer strategic game.
You can talk about Netanyahu's politics and Netanyahu's survival. The only survival most leaders in the Arab world are worried about is biological, not political. That gives you a different amount of freedom and a different perspective on a lot of these issues. I want to ask Dana a question about regional politics, but before I do that, I just want to tell the viewers that you can send questions into the panel through the CSIS web page or the YouTube page. Dana, how do you see the regional picture? How do you see the rebirth of Arab interests in Palestine? Is any of this consequential for Palestinians or for regional politics? How does it look from the regional perspective?
Dr. El Kurd: When we discuss Palestine and the region, there's been a lot of focus on the Axis, Iranian-backed militias, and that kind of framing for how Palestine might impact the region and vice versa. But understanding how Palestine intersects with regional politics must take a wider approach to understand how Arab societies, not just related to these particular militia groups, view Palestine. It is really important for understanding regional opposition and dissent. Palestine as an issue area is a gateway to dissent because it represents this lack of accountability that you mentioned.
I agree with you. Arab governments have this long view of their role in the conflict, but given ramifications of events like the Arab Spring, it may be too comfortable for them to assume that Palestine won't play a larger role in regional dynamics, especially in terms of oppositional politics and the way Arab societies, publics, civil societies, and protest movements are absorbing the information of the last year of war and using it to channel their own grievances. That’s one component. Protests might move in a direction people don't suspect. Another thing is the expansion of the war with no end in sight lends credence to the ideas and narratives of the Axis with the different actors, whether it's Hezbollah or Hamas. It increases the degree to which Arab societies view this as a zero-sum conflict, and that can only escalate the likelihood of regional destabilization. Even if particular Arab governments have a long view of the ongoing crisis and possibly think they can return to normalization at some point, it's not as simple as that. There are a lot of risks in this kind of strategy.
Dr. Alterman: Am I correct in feeling that Arab governments have been restrictive in an unprecedented way about protests over Palestine? Under what circumstances would they be less restrictive in your judgment?
Dr. El Kurd: As I said, especially in the aftermath of the Arab Spring, the issue area of Palestine has become more of a hot topic to Arab governments. They're much more wary of allowing those kinds of protests and that kind of dissent. In the past, it used to be kind of a safety valve. It was one of the only issue areas in some cases in which people could express some political dissent, but that quickly led and metastasized to other issue areas. Arab governments have been very restrictive as a result of that decade of learning about the role of Palestine in the aftermath of the Arab Spring.
They have allowed it at this moment in a very limited sense, and it really depends on a country-by-country basis. It's only been allowed if you are expressing humanitarian concern and fear for people in Gaza. If that transforms into some kind of critique of government policy or the government's approach to any of these issues, including normalization, that has been very swiftly shut down across the region. This is not a very good long-term or winning strategy for them.
Dr. Alterman: Let me ask another regional question. You talked about the way this war is spreading. One way it hasn't yet spread profoundly, but may spread, is in the Israel-Iran direct confrontation. Iran has lobbed missiles at Israel, and Israel has fired back, but we haven't seen anything that I would call normal war between the two. Natan, how do you see the Israel-Iran axis unfolding? Do you see it playing out into a direct war? Do you see it playing out in an indirect war in which Iran works through Palestinian groups? What should we be looking for? What should we be worried about?
Dr. Sachs: That's a good question. This is almost the flip side of what Dana was saying, but I don't think this contradicts it at all. A very prevalent Israeli perspective pits the two views of the Middle East against each other. One, a Palestinian-centric view that when you speak about Middle East peace, that's almost synonymous with Israeli-Palestinian peace as if there's no other problem in the region, which is obviously incorrect—although the conflict is very emotive in the Arab world. That would be a worldview. Netanyahu wrote a chapter in a book back in the early nineties called the “Myth of Palestinian Centrality”. The flip side of this view revolves around the theme of Iran versus Israel and Iran versus some of the Sunni Arab States. The Palestinian issue is useful for Iran as a ticket into the Sunni-dominated world, because they can raise the mantle that the main Sunni states are not.
Dr. Alterman: So it's a Sunni Arab issue for a Shiʿite power?
Dr. Sachs: Exactly, for a Shiʿite power.
Dr. Alterman: Non-Arab, non-Sunni.
Dr. Sachs: They are the only ones raising the banner truly. Pitting the two views against each other is wrong because both can be true. Both the centrality of the Palestinian issue, certainly in Arab, but also in Muslim politics writ large in the Islamic world. I used to live in Indonesia and most people couldn't point to Palestine if you asked them to, but it was an emotive issue even all the way there, and it certainly is now. On the hand, if you look at this war, it is not coincidental that all the cases of actual fighting have been surrounding the Axis of Resistance and nowhere else. It has been seven fronts, as the Israelis like to say. It has been focused on Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, militias in Iraq and in Syria, and Iran itself. All of these are precisely the Axis of Resistance that Iran leads. Hamas is certainly not a Shiʿite organization, but nonetheless align more loosely with the Iranian Axis.
Therefore, there were also those in Israel who very early on, as early as October 11th, 2023, proposed not invading or pushing into Gaza in retaliation first, but going north first. A lot of what we see now, perhaps what Dana was referencing or perhaps the assassination of Nasrallah, was considered seriously on October 11th and was pushed back by someone in the Israeli leadership or by President Biden. Eventually Netanyahu decided against it. That worldview says that at the end of the day, this is fundamentally an Iran-Israel fight. Of course, Hamas has its own calculations. It's not a tool of Iran, but it is backed by it. The stronger enemy was Hezbollah, the main tool of Iran, and therefore the war should go there.
This was a long way of prefacing. This lends itself to the current Israeli campaign, which given the successes Dan described, and despite the cost of life in Lebanon, has very widespread support in Israel. Especially because, second only to the hostages, there is a feeling that the residents of northern Israel, the tens of thousands of Israelis who evacuated after October 8th when Hezbollah joined the fight, have to return home. To do that, they have to feel a sense of safety, not only in agreement with Hezbollah or Lebanon more broadly, but a sense that Hezbollah is not able to carry out an October 7th of their own on the border, which Hezbollah said it would, at least in terms of invading Israel. A retaliation by Israel for the last ballistic missile fired from Iran is likely. I can't tell you what it is.
There is a lot of effort by the United States to limit it and to try to move towards de-escalation. There is a real chance that Israel, including Netanyahu, see their gains in Lebanon and a true degrading of Hezbollah and its capacity. Therefore, they might see an opening to de-escalation since at the end of the day, they will need to deal with Lebanon to bring back their civilians in the north, which is the political imperative domestically.
Dr. Alterman: Though arguably, all the big bets and risks that Netanyahu has taken for the last six months, in Netanyahu's eyes, have worked out better than everybody told him they would. Whether it's going to Rafah, going to Lebanon, or assassinating Nasrallah, all that could really go badly hasn't gone badly.
Dr. Sachs: That's true. It's a very strong sense in Israel, and that's Netanyahu's political line as well. It's a line that says, “Look, I withstood all this pressure. You can't imagine what pressure. Look at the opposition leaders or anyone else in Israel. Who else could have withstood this pressure? Therefore, I am the only one able to conduct this long term.” He's gained some popularity, and he's risen in the polls somewhat, but he is not leading in the polls. He would still likely draw at best, and a draw is a victory of sorts for him, as we've seen in recent years, but he would draw at best. He could easily lose elections. More importantly from his perspective, he may be thwarting elections. They're only scheduled for two years from now. Given that he also managed to bring someone else into the coalition, he could easily try to maneuver politics that way, or he could go a completely different route, which is to say, “My big successes mean I can chance elections.”
 I don't know what the next move is with Iran. We are in a very different territory than we were after April 13th when Iran fired directly at Israel for the first time in history. Actually fighting from Iran and sustaining direct, overt Israeli responses on Iran. We're in a very different territory. Part of what we're seeing today, the Israeli calculation and response is based on whether that equation can stand. It is based on whether Iran can now calculate that regardless of Iran and Israel exchanging some fire, the rules of the game are that the great powers, especially the United States, come in and quiet things down. While the Israelis say, “No, the rules have to be before that. You dare not shoot at Israel. That must be the rules of the game.” This is very dangerous, but all the dire warnings of many of these things have come, at most, to partial fruition. In Lebanon, we have not yet seen the all-out war that we fear.
Dr. Alterman: Dan, let me ask you. You've thought about Hezbollah, Hamas, and irregular warfare more generally. Are you surprised that Iran hasn't more aggressively advanced the Axis of Resistance against an Israeli onslaught, or is this what you would've thought would happen?
Dr. Byman: I've certainly been surprised by how much Israel has been able to degrade Hezbollah. Iran was always a relatively weak actor in terms of its own capabilities. Its conventional military forces are quite limited, it's limited economically, and most of its systems are not advanced. Yes, it has these rocket missile forces, but this has been an education for many people in the importance of air defense. For many years, Israel has been working on developing a truly comprehensive air defense system against small, short-range stuff from Gaza, but also, the big, ballistic missiles that are hard to shoot down from Iran. We knew before this that they had made a lot of progress.
I'm a little less surprised that Iran has been cautious, but there are some question marks. This has not just been provocative for Iran; it's been embarrassing for Iran. Israel has not only degraded its major proxy, Hezbollah, but it's done significant operations at the heart of the regime in Iran itself. Iran's responses have been lackluster, and one possibility is Iran backs away, right? It doesn't have to necessarily fight. If Israel has a mid-level response, Iran may say, “We'll strike another day,” but do nothing in reality.
Dr. Alterman: As they did after the April 13 strikes.
Dr. Byman: Exactly. But Iran might also move towards international terrorism here. We've seen that in the past with attacks in Bulgaria and Argentina. This is a way of responding when you can't respond through traditional military means. But I will say, there's still a big question about what Hezbollah is going to be able to do with the remainder of its arsenal. Is it unable to fight? Has it simply taken so many losses that it can't use this effectively? Or is it actually trying to avoid further escalation? I'm not quite sure what Hezbollah would be fearing, so I do think the degradation is quite real.
I did want to throw in one point that is a little different, and I'd like to get Dana's or anyone else’s views on this. It is about the Palestinian Authority as a partner for Israel. From a counter-terrorism point of view, the PA in the West Bank has been incredibly important on a day-to-day basis in helping Israel ensure its security in the West Bank, going after Hamas remnants, and—in the eyes of critical Palestinians—being a handmaiden of the Israeli occupation. There seems to be a fairly dramatic shift in Israeli policy in terms of disregarding the PA leadership and doing major operations in the West Bank with no concern for their political standing.
That's a very significant shift. Thank goodness that hasn't been as bloody as Gaza or Lebanon, but it's certainly causing a lot of casualties, and it also raises the long-term question of what the West Bank is going to look like.
Dr. El Kurd: This is reflected in some of the polling I mentioned earlier. This is why the Palestinian public fears that the levels of violence we're seeing in Gaza might be replicated in some way. In fact, we are seeing some tactics replicated in the West Bank, where we have the razing of infrastructure and attacks on hospitals. The Palestinian Authority is absolutely not seen as a deterrent in its relationship with Israel. As you mentioned, for most Palestinians, it's seen as a subcontractor of occupation. There was this element that they might be able to negotiate with Israel or, as the Israeli partner, might be able to engage the Israeli state in some way. As you mentioned, that's not happening.
To be honest, this is merely a continuing trend from what we were already seeing. Especially after the Unity Intifada time frame, between May and August of 2021, this has been the case. There have been extensive operations in the West Bank against different militant groups that have popped up unrelated to Hamas, and there have been extensive operations in urban centers like Nablus. The Palestinian Authority has not been able to act as some sort of partner with Israel, and that already damaged its role and legitimacy with the Palestinian public long before last year.
This only puts the last nail in the coffin for the Palestinian Authority as some sort of legitimate actor that represents Palestinians in the West Bank. I am concerned that if the international community or the United States doesn't lend credence to some of the other attempts to create legitimacy in Palestinian politics, then that vacuum is going to be filled by other types of political action.
Dr. Alterman: There are too many PhDs sitting in this room for me not to ask a question about grading. We have a question here: how would you grade the Biden administration's performance toward this conflict? The Biden administration had a theory of the case. It's been very active diplomatically with Israel and Arab states. It has chosen what to engage on, how to engage, and what to say. Understanding that GPAs are now rising, and average grades are somewhere above A-minus at many leading schools, how would you grade the administration's strategic performance? Not that it can control the situation, but it can control what it does.
Dr. Sachs: I'm going to let the active professors take that first.
Dr. Byman: Dana, I'll start but ask you to correct me. Leverage on the primary actor, which is Israel, is exceptionally weak. That's because, as Natan said at the beginning, the stakes for most Israelis. There is widespread support across party lines that this is an existential moment and that the country is facing a wide range of threats and that a very strong response is required.
With that in mind, I think the administration has set a number of red lines, the vast majority of which have been violated. Then, it sets them again, and they get violated or ignored. That looks foolish. It's hard. I don't have great answers for how you do this. It would require a reconsideration of how the United States has approached Israel and changing it dramatically from the U.S. response for the last 50 years, where the United States really effectively doesn't support Israel as much.
If you look at the latest confrontation with Iran, the United States is trying to have it both ways. It's saying, “Don't escalate, but we're going to provide you intelligence, we're giving you military support. We're going to stand by you 100 percent.” That's not the biggest threat against escalation. In fact, one could argue it's exactly the opposite. It's basically giving a green light. In that sense, I would say the United States has certainly not done well. It looks foolish to many Arab audiences, and it looks weak.
At the same time, the Biden administration scored a lot of points with Israelis, which was their primary audience. Especially early in the conflict, there was a genuine sense of empathy by the President that went a long way and gained some goodwill where there was a lot of concerned suspicion. I'm sympathetic because I don't have great ideas myself for how the United States should change its approach to the conflict, but I can't look around and say the United States has been incredibly successful.
Dr. Alterman: Professor Byman, is that a B?
Dr. Byman: It depends on what standard you want to use, but yeah, I'll put it in the B range. I think that's fair.
Dr. Alterman: Dana?
Dr. El Kurd: Wow. It's so generous. I guess I'm a hard grader. I recently wrote something that the editors then titled “Washington Isn't Learning Any Lessons.”
Dr. Alterman: It's an interesting piece in Foreign Policy.
Dr. El Kurd: It came out today. The empathy that you mentioned that was shown to an Israeli audience and won the Biden administration points on that front was matched by a complete lack of empathy towards Palestinians and towards Arabs, generally. That has harmed the Biden administration here in this country as well.
I am particularly concerned and frustrated with the fact that, whatever the diplomatic behind-the-scenes is happening, as you said, there were all these red lines that were crossed. Any ideas that we have about what the “day after” might look like in the Palestinian Territories, or how we might get back to a framework to resolve this conflict in some way, have not deviated very much from reconfigurations of the original status quo that led us here. It seems like the Biden administration hasn't been able to absorb the lessons of its first three years in office, which led to the point where October 7th happened and where this war unfolds. There have been no new ideas about where we go from here. That's really the biggest concern.
Obviously, all the red lines that were crossed during the last year, the lack of response, and the lack of capacity to try to condition aid in some way are very harmful with Arab, Palestinian, and global audiences. The biggest concern is: where do we go from here? Have the United States’ decision-makers thought to themselves, “We have to try something other than what we've been trying?” I don't see a lot of evidence of that and that's why I would grade them much more poorly.
Dr. Sachs: I wanted to make two points. First, when you're thinking about the success of U.S. strategy, the question is about goals. The U.S. administration and Biden himself early on were not just trying to gain Israeli solidarity. He genuinely identified with the two main Israeli goals, which were that Hamas should not be allowed to govern and poses a threat from the Gaza Strip and the return of the hostages, including American hostages. Those were the main goals.
A lot of difficult that people have is with the duality of the United States’ position. On one hand, it's the guarantor of the world order and seen as the one that should restore equilibrium. When something goes wrong almost anywhere, but certainly in the Middle East, people say, ""Who in Washington is in charge of this? Who in Washington is fixing this problem?""
On the other hand, the United States, and certainly President Biden, see themselves as an ally of Israel. Therefore, the administration has, at times, felt that if it aired grievances with Netanyahu, regarding a hostage deal or ceasefire deal, it would be understood as if Hamas is not an obstacle for it. This would cause Hamas, and Sinwar in particular, to harden their positions. They're playing this dual game.
The second point I wanted to make is that, very early on, even during the very first speech that Biden gave, the administration correctly identified their main geopolitical, strategic goal and unique position in minimizing the risk for all-out war. They were correct in understanding that it is a role that only the United States can play.
Now, we're much closer to an all-out war right now than we were just a few months ago, but nonetheless, on this, I think their grade is pretty high. Recall that, not only did President Biden, very early on, issue a stern warning to any state and any organization, which everyone understood as Iran and Hezbollah, from joining the fight, but he also moved a carrier group and then a second carrier group.
Then, on April 13th and14th, the United States Central Command coordinated a historic event. It was not just a historic Iranian attack; it was a joint coalition led by CENTCOM in which Arab states defended Israel actively. That happened again now. Whether good or bad, that is very much in service of the goal that Biden identified. That could come to naught, but it offsets a lot of the frustration that they and others have felt on the Gaza front.
Dr. Alterman: You've been an adjunct instructor at Georgetown. What would you give the administration?
Dr. Sachs: I would go to the dean at the time, Dan Byman, and ask him. It depends on which realm. On the regional realm, it might be an A-minus. On the Gaza front, it's much harder to decide because of exactly what Dan said. They have a very difficult partner on the Israeli side. They also have an impossible player here, which is Sinwar. Sinwar has veto on this all the time.
Israelis complain vociferously against Netanyahu and his prioritization of things and the lack of prioritization of a hostage deal. Criticism that I share. But what Israelis say that they are assuming, of course, is that Sinwar is worse by far. 100 times over, and I'm not trying to make some equivalence or something. That's not my point. My point is that the administration is trying to play a game where both of these very difficult actors have veto. The result has been lacking. Unlike everyone else on Twitter and everywhere else, I am not as smart to know what all of the answers would've been.
Dr. Alterman: We are going to have to leave it there. I want to thank my colleagues, Dana El Kurd, Dan Byman, and Natan Sachs. Thank you all for joining us. There is a theme page on the CSIS homepage that has a lot of our work on the conflict and current assessments, including a new report that Dan published, some things that I have published. I've really learned a lot from this conversation. I hope you have too. We will put a transcript up quickly and we look forward to seeing you all again very soon. Thank you much for joining us."
21,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/cut-methane-build-global-capacity,Ben Cahill,"October 3, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"Methane reductions will be high on the agenda at November’s UN Conference of the Parties (COP29) climate summit, but there is a problem in efforts to cut emissions of this greenhouse gas. Most expertise in methane science resides in Western countries, but this knowledge must be shared widely to meet global reduction targets. To help oil- and gas-producing states and national oil companies (NOCs) cut methane, the United States and the European Union should help fund capacity building in Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Government support and philanthropic efforts should focus on training scientists and engineers to take on this challenge in their home countries.
Awareness of the methane challenge has grown rapidly over the past decade. Methane is believed to be responsible for at least 25 percent of global warming in the industrial era. Despite many government and corporate pledges, these emissions are still growing at a faster rate than other greenhouse gases, and atmospheric concentrations of methane are still rising. This is a particular challenge for the energy industry, which accounts for more than one-third of anthropogenic methane emissions—with the majority of this share coming from oil and gas production.
The good news is that new rules and technology breakthroughs will enable progress. Regulations in the United States, the European Union, and elsewhere will require companies to monitor, report, and verify their methane emissions, cut gas flaring and venting, and use remote sensing and continuous monitoring systems to find and address fugitive emissions. The industry’s largest producers have already made substantial reductions in methane intensity.
The bad news is that these advances are uneven. In the United States, emissions performance varies among operators even within the same production basin, and there is a big discrepancy between company-reported data and measured data from satellites and aerial surveys. Internationally, methane reductions are still in the early stages. The wasteful and environmentally hazardous practice of gas flaring persists in countries including Russia, Iran, Iraq, Venezuela, and Algeria. NOCs account for about half of global oil and gas production, but these companies have economic and energy security mandates that can hamper their climate commitments. A number of NOCs have pledged to greatly reduce their methane emissions by 2030, but others have no discernible targets.
Human capacity is a key challenge. Even NOCs with firm reduction targets lack many staff members with the technical background and training needed to develop advanced methane detection and quantification. Deploying new measurement technologies, interpreting data and results, and reconciling different emissions estimates are challenging tasks. Bridging this gap will be essential to help NOCs meet their methane reduction goals.
Plenty of organizations are offering to help. Industry groups like the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative and voluntary initiatives like the Methane Guiding Principles create peer pressure for methane reductions and help companies share best practices. The World Bank recently launched, with government and industry support, a program to finance methane abatement projects and provide policy support to governments. Philanthropies are supporting efforts to boost methane transparency and create roadmaps and accountability frameworks. Organizations like the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership hold frequent workshops and training sessions for NOCs. And the Energy Emissions Modeling and Data Lab is developing open-access models and tools to support better emissions accounting across supply chains.
However, the concentration of methane science in North America and Europe is an obstacle to global methane reduction. It is encouraging that so many academics, students, and policy wonks in the United States are tackling the methane challenge, but it is important to develop this capacity in other countries as well—especially resource-rich countries that will continue to produce oil and gas for decades to come.
Government agencies and philanthropies should fund new research centers at universities in countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia with close links to NOCs. Training the next generation of engineers, atmospheric scientists, and health, safety, and environment experts in leading-edge methane detection and quantification would equip them to address these challenges in their home countries. University consortia, faculty exchanges, and visiting fellowships could foster collaboration and support research by PhD students and postdocs.
Governments, foundations, and international organizations helped to create strong momentum for methane reductions in the oil and gas sector. The next goal should be to accelerate and sustain progress by developing new centers of excellence for methane science around the world.

22,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/nro-story-conversation-dr-chris-scolese,Unknown,"October 3, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS event hosted on October 3, 2024. Watch the full video here.
Emily Harding: OK, everybody. Thank you so much for being here today. I’m Emily Harding. I’m the director of the Intelligence, National Security, and Technology Program here at CSIS.
And we are here today to talk about the power of presence in space. In the very recent past, a persistent presence in orbit was the sole domain of national governments. But over the last decade or so, we’ve seen a transformation and the start of a generational change. There is now a far wider range of nations sending stuff into orbit. Commercial providers have become a necessary part of nations’ national security picture.
And today we’re talking about NRO, which is a real American national treasure. It has been there for the duration, but so quietly that most Americans had no idea they existed. Today, however, they’re starting to come out of the shadows in a way that we have not seen before.
And we have with us today Dr. Chris Scolese, the director of NRO. He started his career as a naval officer working on nuclear propulsion. But from the sea, he turned to space and never went back. He had a long career at NASA, including becoming NASA’s chief engineer, acting administrator, and director of the Goddard Space Flight Center. And then, in 2019, he became the director of NRO, and he was the first Senate-confirmed person to hold that position. And that really was meant to communicate the seriousness with which the Senate took NRO’s mission, and also the oversight that they thought was required of this massive program that was so important to the country. I had the privilege of helping out with that nomination process, and it was – it was really interesting to see.
Both Dr. Scolese and my colleague Kari Bingen, who will introduce herself here in just a second, are super big brains when it comes to space policy, so I have dubbed myself the generalist on this stage who can try to translate some of the really exquisite capabilities they’re going to be talking about for a more generalist audience.
But first, NRO has brought us a video showing off what they do.
(A video presentation is shown.)
Kari A. Bingen: My name is Kari Bingen. I’m the director of the Aerospace Security Project here at CSIS. And it’s a real privilege to have you, Dr. Scolese.
I am struck by that video. And just think about it for a moment. The National Reconnaissance Office is an organization that’s been around over 60 years, but for a lot of that time didn’t exist. The government didn’t acknowledge its existence until 1992. So to be able to sit here and see a video like that is pretty, pretty spectacular.
And I also just want to emphasize, too, it is – it is incredibly unique to have a director of the National Reconnaissance Office here at CSIS talking publicly about the organization and about the mission. We’ve had a chance to talk at some trade association events and whatnot, but there’s a different audience here. And so we very much appreciate you coming out and talking to that broader audience and educating us.
I was fortunate to meet Dr. Scolese back in the 2018-2019 timeframe was you were getting ready to go through your confirmation process that Emily mentioned. And as we were thinking about it in the Department of Defense, where I was at the time, we wanted to ensure that that first Senate-confirmed director was not political; was focused on technical soundness, sound management, and very apolitical in the job. Because when you think about acquiring and operating satellites, that’s just not a political thing. So we were so privileged that Dr. Scolese said yes, you know, I will sign up for this mission and continue to serve the nation. So we’ve very thankful that you did.
We have about 30 minutes of Q&A that both Emily and myself will do with Dr. Scolese, and then we’ll open it up to audience questions both in person here and online. So if you’re online, go to the event website. There’s a button there to click to ask a question. We’ll get it here. And then also, if you’re in the audience, there’s a QR code here for the folks in person. So we do encourage your questions.
With that, I’m going to turn it back over to Emily.
Ms. Harding: So the floor is yours, sir. Tell us a little bit about NRO and the mission that you serve. If you had to explain to somebody who had never heard of NRO before what you do, how would you describe it?
Dr. Chris Scolese: Certainly. Well, first, thanks for having me here. And you don’t have to call me Dr. Scolese; please call me Chris. I’d appreciate that.
So the NRO, as has been mentioned, it’s been around for about 60 years, a little more than 60 years. For about half that time, we were a secret. And there was an important reason for us to be a secret at that time. But our fundamental mission hasn’t changed over that 60 years. Our job is to go off and collect from the vantage point of space what’s happening on the Earth and deliver that to the analyst, the policymaker, the warfighter, the first responder, whoever needs that information. And we have continued to do that over those 60 years.
And over that time, we have consistently innovated. We have consistently kept up with the times. Oftentimes, we have led technology because countries and people want to prevent us from seeing or finding out what they’re doing, so we have to stay ahead that way. We have technology and we need to stay there so that we can make our systems affordable and capable. And at the same time, we’ve also taken advantage of using, as you said, Emily, the capabilities that already exist. If it exists, why recreate it? With a strong commercial industry, we’re taking, you know, a lot of advantage of that.
And the other thing that’s really a difference in the last 30 years is the NRO used to have a contained workforce, if you will, and now we actually recruit and we bring in people. If you’re going to do that, you have to tell people you exist – (laughter) – or else they can’t find you.
So we have adapted over time. We’ve driven innovation. We’ve driven technology. We’ve taken advantage of it. And you know, we’ve stayed ahead of the competition, if you will.
Ms. Harding: So your role is one of both an intelligence agency and also a defense agency. And your point about workforce, if I’m right, once upon a time NRO pulled personnel directly from CIA and elements of the IC, and then also from the Defense Department. But now that you’re doing this open recruiting, you need a much broader swath of people. So can you talk a little bit about that dual role as an intelligence agency and also a defense agency?
Dr. Scolese: Oh, absolutely. You know, the – if you’re operating in space, you can see the whole globe. Therefore, that information should be made available to anybody that needs that information, so the IC or the DOD. It’s efficient to have one organization go off and do that within, you know, certain boundaries, of course, that we need to go off and look at. And that’s the role that the NRO has played.
And really, the difference has been how quickly do you need the data, and how much data do you need, and how varied is that data. You know, in the 1960s, when we were created, dropping buckets from the sky was fine. The world wasn’t changing that fast, or that need. There was one adversary at that time, the Soviet Union, that we had to deal with. As we progressed, we needed information faster and faster, and that’s true today. People would like information instantaneously, like they can – you know, like you can get with Twitter or X or whatever it is, right? And that’s our job, to deliver that information faster and to deliver the information that’s needed, which means different phenomenologies from what we had in the 1960s, which were mostly, you know, film capsules coming back with exquisite pictures of whatever it is that was – that was being looked at. Today, we have to look more broadly than that because there’s more complicated techniques.
So our fundamental job has stayed the same. And it – and we serve well both the Department of Defense and the intelligence community, and to the extent that they need it the civil communities, for doing that. And I think it’s an efficient use of resources. It’s a vantage point that takes advantage of, you know, holistically, the whole Earth. And it allows us to distribute that information quickly, and it allows us to coordinate with all those groups to deliver the information that, ultimately, is needed.
Ms. Harding: So before I turn it over to Kari to talk about some of the generational change, I remember the old TV show “24” and laughing when they were like, redirect the satellites from my cellphone. (Laughter.) It was like, if only we could – we could do that. But we’re getting closer and closer to that real-time look-in that you’re talking about.
I’m going to ask you to explain, though, dropping buckets from the sky, because that’s a literal thing that used to happen. So what did that mean?
Dr. Scolese: So in the 1960s it was very difficult to take pictures and beam them to Earth. I mean, today we have cellphones and, you know, anybody that was probably born after 1990 has no idea what film is. And the – so the most efficient way to get it was to put the camera in space; have the film with the camera; take the picture; roll up the film when you’re done taking all the pictures; put it in a – in a bucket, essentially a reentry vehicle; and drop it down to Earth with a parachute. And if you ever get a chance, go to YouTube and watch it. It’s CORONA capture of a film capsule coming down. An airplane would catch it in the air, and then it would go and get – the film would get processed and those imageries would be distributed. 
But I think there’s one other thing that we should mention. The first really capable NRO satellite that delivered was called GRAB. It was about 20 inches. And it was – so it would be considered a cubesat today. And that one did transmit information to the ground directly, but it wasn’t images; it was locating where radars are. 
Ms. Harding: Massive leap forward. Let’s talk about our leap forwards today.
Ms. Bingen: Well, it’s interesting as you’re talking about CORONA, there was a fantastic history that the NRO historian has put out there on CORONA and other programs. One of our team here at CSIS, Christina Nordby, actually found an NRO cartoon series.
Dr. Scolese: Yes.
Ms. Bingen: Legit cartoon series about the history of the NRO. So I commend that reading to folks. 
But you go from the dropping film cannisters to building, you know, these very big, exquisite systems. Now, as the threat has evolved, the technology has evolved, you’ve talked about we are in a moment of generational change with our overhead architecture. Can you talk through what – explain, really, what that is. 
And you’ve been out there in the press talking about a proliferated satellite architecture that NRO is pursuing. Talk to us about what you’re doing there. 
Dr. Scolese: Sure. There’s a lot of things that are happening today. 
You know, the first thing I’ll say is, you know, today, as we speak, we have satellites ranging in size from cubesats to the large, exquisite satellites that you’re talking about. That allows us to deliver the information that is needed in the best possible way. We’re also engaging, you know, commercial entities so that they can fill in gaps and take over part of the mission so that we can focus on those things that are extremely difficult to go off and do. 
And the proliferated architecture is something that kind of addresses all of these things. We need to have persistence or fast revisit. Persistence you get by going into higher orbits, but that means you need much, much larger apertures in order to accomplish whatever the mission is, to go off and do that. Or you can proliferate your architecture, put more satellites up there so that a satellite is always coming over an area within a given reasonable amount of time that’s needed by the users. And that’s what we’re doing with a proliferated architecture. That’s enabled by a really rich commercial industry that’s building hundreds or thousands of satellites that allowed us to take those satellites, adapt them to our use at low cost, and apply whatever sensor is needed to go off and acquire the information that’s needed at whatever revisit time is required. So it gives us that capability, so it allows us to revisit, provide the information at a very high rate of speed and deliver it, you know, directly to the user. 
The other thing it allows us to do is it allows us protection of that architecture. We all know that there are countries – you know, Russia and China are examples – that have developed ASATs that can take out satellites. Well, if you have a hundred satellites up there, you have to have at least a hundred missiles in order to take them down, and that gets to be much, much more complicated in order to deal with that. So it gives us a degree of resilience that we didn’t have before. 
The other thing it gives us is an opportunity to refresh at a higher rate so that we’re constantly improving the technology as either the technology comes along or the threat changes or the mission changes to some extent. So that allows us to move at a much, much higher pace than we have in the past. 
Ms. Bingen: What’s interesting is a lot of us in the aerospace community, we tend to focus on satellites. But when you’re getting to a point where you’ve got hundreds up there, some of the manual processes that we use, making sure analysts are looking at every single image that comes through, like, that model for me just is – you can’t sustain that model. So can you also talk about the – apply that generational-change thinking to what are we doing on – I’ll say on the ground side, the tasking, the processing, the analysis with some of these tools like AI technologies will bring?
Dr. Scolese: Yeah, absolutely. So it is changing. It has changed because, again, we can deliver information faster with the systems that we have if we can, you know, reduce that data very quickly into a – into a product that is needed. But you’re right, once you go to a proliferated architecture and you’re talking – you’re going from a few to – a few satellites to tens of satellites to now hundreds of satellites, you have to change a lot of things. And we’re in the process of doing that.
So operating a proliferated architecture means that it’s no longer possible to go off and for an individual sitting at a control center to say I know what this satellite is doing. So we have to have the machines to go off and help us there.
We need artificial intelligence, machine learning, automated processes to help us do that. Fortunately, Kepler helps us, you know, when it comes to that. But when it comes to tasking the satellites, asking them what to do, and figuring out which satellite is the best one to do it or which combination is, that’s where we’re taking advantage of, you know, advanced processing techniques, some of the techniques in artificial intelligence and machine learning, to do that.
And then you’re right, also now we’ve already been bringing down a lot of data, particularly in some parts of our constellation, so we have a head start on being able to go off and pull out from large databases the signals that our functional managers or our users need that they can go off and use very quickly. And we’re going to be applying that to the proliferated architectures as well.
Ms. Harding: Yeah. So let’s keep talking about that innovation theme. Kari mentioned AI. We’ve done some work here on the possibility of on-orbit processing so you’re not sending huge amounts of data down to ground stations; you can figure out on orbit what of these images is actually the most important and get it down quicker or to a more direct ground station. So talk about what you see ahead for this kind of con stellation and what fun toys we should look forward to in the near future.
Dr. Scolese: (Laughs.) Well, certainly, yes, on-orbit processing, we do it today, but we need to do more of it. And with the advanced processors that are out there, it’s going to allow us to do even more so we can deliver the information that’s needed. 
But I think the real value is going to be coming from merging various datasets to deliver a product. Whether you do that on orbit or you do it on the ground – it’s probably easier to do it on the ground – but what you want to do is to get the information that’s needed to the ground so that there you can even speed that up. So we’re going to be using on-orbit processing more as we go forward. 
And you know, the processing chips have gotten smaller and more capable and more available, so that’s going to really allow us to go off and do it. We just need to figure out how to make it work in space. 
Ms. Harding: Details, details. (Laughs.) We know you’ll get there. 
We were talking in the green room a little bit about quantum sensing, which I think is just so cool when we can make it work. Do you want to talk a little bit about where you are on that? 
Dr. Scolese: Well, we’re all in the – you know, in the early phases of doing quantum sensing, particularly remote quantum sensing. And the advantage of this is you’re using fundamental physics to go off and do detections, which allows you to get information, you know, faster because you don’t have as much processing that’s needed. You’ll know what the differences are. It’s very difficult to spoof those things because you’ll know it. That’s one of the things that are there. And it has applications from, you know, communications, which is probably the furthest along, to measuring, you know, the gravitational differences on the Earth, or any planet for that matter. So there’s broad applications to it, and we’re in the process of working through all of that. 
And we’re working with – in that particular case, since it is very early research, we do have an advanced technology group, and they’re the ones that are working it. And they’re working with not only industry, but also with academia to go off and develop those capabilities. And we’ve set up a research lab that will allow us – we were talking about going a little bit more public. Our research lab, we can do unclassified research. A lot of this is very fundamental research, so we need to have that opportunity to be able to go off and do that. In fact, next week we’re going to have an unclassified conference at the NRO talking about the technologies that we need, and offering the opportunity for others to come in in an unclassified arena to share their ideas and build the relationships that we need. We’ve routinely had classified conferences, but this is to open it up even broader. 
Ms. Harding: So talk a little bit about NRO’s role as the fast follower in partnerships like this where we see the commercial sector or the academic sector actually pushing forward the bounds of the science and then NRO finds itself taking advantage of those discoveries and trying to partner with those groups. How are you envisioning trying to push NRO into that partnership role? 
Dr. Scolese: It was a natural role. I mean, it kind of started out that way. You know, if you read the history books, there was a lot of that happening. You look at some of the pioneers, they called them, in the NRO, they came from industry that were, you know, researchers like Edwin Land, you know, the Polaroid camera. You know, you wouldn’t – you wouldn’t imagine that. Richard Garwin, who was a researcher at IBM, as well as, you know, university professor. So it’s in our DNA to go off and work with the community at the – at the leading edge of technology. 
And it’s a two-way street. They’re developing capabilities, whether it’s, you know, new math models or new technologies, and we want to be engaged in working with them. Which is one of the reasons we’ve established this – unclassified opportunities for getting together. We’ve had it, but it’s been in – you know, tighter confines. This way, it opens it up so that we can – we can bring in even more. And at the same time, we have gone off and demanded and pushed technologies that ultimately end up on the other side, in the commercial sector or otherwise. So I would say it’s in our DNA to go off and have that relationship and make it work, and we’re continuing to go off and do that. 
The neat thing now is there’s a lot more capability out there than there was when the NRO first started, when, as one of you said, it was largely government-run. You know, space was largely government. And most of the others was in individual technologies, not space technologies. That’s changed, so now we have that additional benefit coming to us. 
Ms. Harding: So before I turn it over to Kari to talk about some of the intergovernmental challenges that we have, I want you to talk a little bit about hard targets and how you’re using those partnerships, how you’re using those advances in technology to go after the truly difficult intelligence questions, places where you cannot get people on the ground but you can see them from space. 
Dr. Scolese: Well, you think you can see them from space – (laughter) – because they try and hide them, and that requires us to go off and do all the things that we talked about: the proliferated architectures, now you can’t hide because you’re constantly being looked at; greater persistence, again you can’t hide because we’re constantly looking. But there’s many other things. There’s camouflage, if you think about it. There’s lots of techniques that can be used. Which means we have to go off and look at, you know, very different phenomenologies. And we’ve developed capabilities and are developing capabilities that will allow us to defeat those types of activities. 
And you know, quantum sensing is one of them. You can’t really hide from, you know, fundamental physics. 
Ms. Harding: That’s a great tagline for NRO: You can’t hide from fundamental physics. (Laughter.) 
Kari? (Laughs.) 
Ms. Bingen: So I’m going to hit on an issue that I worked on when I was in the Pentagon and I know you’re in the middle of it day in, day out, which is this Title 10/Title 50 issue. So for those that aren’t following, Title 10 is the Department of Defense’s authorities/missions. Title 50 is the intelligence community’s authorities and missions. And you know, if I think about it from a DOD perspective, they’re starting – they’re putting more missions into space. GMTI – so ground-moving target indicator – is a great example of that. That is a mission that’s long been done by aircraft. But as the adversary gets better at their capabilities to keep us out it’s pushing us further and further back, those aircraft are vulnerable, so we’re going to space. But that’s a battlespace awareness mission; it’s not necessarily a traditional intelligence mission. But yet, you all are building the – that capability for our nation. 
So, you know, you were talking about this generational change. How is that community wrestling with and thinking about, as more of these missions go to space, it’s not business as usual – it’s not the traditional way that we’ve tasked these systems, processed them, analyzed them – because speed is of the essence getting that information right to, say, the warfighter? So how are you thinking through those – some of those issues that are manifesting, I think, with this, but there’s probably more to come? 
Dr. Scolese: Yeah. You know – you know, that’s really a good question, and you’ve given me a thing that will – that makes me think about it. 
You know, building the satellites and operating from the vantage point of space doesn’t care about Title 10 or Title 50. It’s when it hits the ground and who uses it, right? So I actually think of these problems as a datacentric problem. We have to deliver the data at the speed and with the characteristics that the user – and it can be any user – needs. 
So GMTI is, obviously, going to go off and need information on where an object is and where it is going, right, in real time. We need to deliver that data there. Others will be delivering, also, data. That data has to be fused into a product that is used. 
This was the same problem that we had back when they were moving this to airborne, when now all of a sudden you’re remotely sensing it where, you know, the operator in the aircraft can’t necessarily see the object on the ground without the benefit of equipment. So, you know, we’re there, and we’re in the process of figuring out how do we bring all that data down, and how do we assimilate it in such a way that we can deliver, in this particular case, to the warfighter the information they need that’s going to keep that object, you know, tracked with high reliability? 
So I think of it more as a datacentric problem. We can collect the data. That data could be used Title 10, Title 50. It can be used in the civil applications, wherever it needs to be. It’s how you, ultimately, fuse that data, assuming that you’re delivering it at the quality and at the time rate of – the time that they need it and the rate of time that they need it, and you’re able to provide the discrimination to detect the object. 
Ms. Bingen: Well, and on ground-moving target indicator, GMTI, you now have this operational challenge presented to you of, you know, we have to track these vehicles, and we’re tracking them across multiple satellites. These satellites are handing off to each other. So you now have to be able to do all of that in real time. 
You also have this other dimension which, you know, you’re collecting electro-optical color images, you’re collecting radar images, you’re collecting signals; you have to fuse that all together in real time. My hypothesis, though, is those technology challenges are solvable. And your engineers are doing a phenomenal job there, and I’ll want you to talk about that. 
But some of the challenges where – you know, when you’re doing those kind of tasking handoffs, or you’re having to tip and queue between a signals collection system and an imaging system, there are policy challenges, there are cultural challenges. So can you talk through some of those pieces? 
Dr. Scolese: Sure. Yeah. So we’re used to doing hard things, generally hard technical things. Policy things tend to be even harder – (laughs) – as you well know. And you know, you’re right; I mean, the technical challenges, we are in the process of solving those and we are making good progress. Some of those have been solved. Some of them, still work to be done. 
The policy ones, we’re still in the process of working through all of those things. And they range from the mundane – how do we, you know, make sure that the information we’re giving to the user, the warfighter, is accurate, and who’s going to make – you know, who is going to do that in the field; I mean mundane in the sense of, you know, you would expect us to go off and do that – and some of it is more complicated, along the lines that you’re talking about, how do we integrate all of these different systems in a way that will allow all of that data to come down in a format that is usable to be put together, so that – so that we can deliver the product that’s needed.
And we are in the process of continuing to work through that. Again, we’re making a lot of progress there. We’re going through it. We put prototypes of the various satellites up there. That’s allowed us to see what they can do. It’s also allowed us to participate in exercises where we can go off and test those various things. We’re also doing tabletop exercises and gaming to allow us to go off and test things at the edges and say, what if, this? And then, you know, OK, now we need to adjust, you know, X, Y, or Z. And that’s helping us to identify are there policy areas or gaps that we need to go off and address? 
From the building of the satellites, there’s really no gaps there. From bringing the data down, there’s really no gaps other than you have to make sure that you get it. But putting all the data together and making that a viable product at the end, that’s where we’re going off and doing it. We’re making good progress. The exercises are helping us an awful lot as we do that to get that done. And of course, that’s just a small subset of what’s up there. You know, in – by roughly December of this year – from last June till December of this year we’ll have probably launched 100 satellites. So we are going from the demo phase to the operational phase, where we’re really going to be able to start testing all of this stuff out in a more operational way. 
Ms. Bingen: So that’s a challenge to the policymaking community, to get the policies – the authorities fixed, so that as those operational capabilities come online it’s seamless for the users.
Ms. Harding: And that is the hardest challenge of all. 
Ms. Bingen: Oh my gosh, yeah. (Laughter.)
Ms. Harding: Absolutely. I love listening to a very smart engineer talk through a really complicated problem. You make it sound like it’s so straightforward and logical. Like, we do this, and then we do this, and then it works. If only policy was that straightforward. You used the word “mundane,” which I find really funny because even a mundane day at NRO – (laughter) – is still a pretty exciting day, with all the amazing work that you guys are doing. 
I want to remind the audience to send in your questions. We’ve already got some online – actually, a bunch coming in from online. But scan the QR code and send them in, and we will ask Dr. Scolese, Chris, what he thinks about these questions. Before we do that though I want to hit on the topic of trust in intelligence, which is something near and dear to my heart. After a long career working in the intelligence world, I now have the privilege to be more out in public talking about what the intel space does, trying to debunk some of the worst myths, misconceptions. And your entry onto sort of a more public role in bringing NRO into the light, I think, is a great opportunity to talk about this.
Balancing classification with transparency. How are you envisioning that as a way ahead for the NRO? And then this new era of openness, one way that we saw this really be a huge intelligent success was the Biden administration’s decision to release a lot of information about the impending Russian invasion of Ukraine. Some of that was satellite imagery. Some of that was other intelligence. But the fact of being able to point to evidence that nobody could ignore, that this was a thing that was about to happen, I think, really prepared the world for what was going to be a ground war in Europe that we haven’t seen for decades. So talk a little bit about the way that the IC can operate more in the light, and also just why the American people should be really proud of the work that you’re doing. 
Dr. Scolese: Well, I mean, you know, our job is to deliver information. And ours is – again, you know, we’re collecting photons and electrons and we need to turn that into a product, which is a lot easier to do in some respects from figuring out intention. Our job is to give unequivocal, clear data that comes from the satellite. So it’s an image or a signal. And we take those and make sure it works. So we’re checking calibration. We’re checking, you know, the satellite’s ability to point and deliver data, all of those things. So it’s really, you know, objective evidence of what’s going on.
The point you made is an example of how we’ve come to work very effectively with our commercial partners. Combining both the systems that we need to protect the information from and using the commercial imagery, we were able to share all of that data and be able to say, hey – well, not us, actually. The NRO doesn’t do that. But because we had that ability, we were able to give that information as unclassified information, and that was able to be shared with everybody. 
At the same time, we’re also, you know, looking at our products and saying, you know, what really needs to be classified? I mean, it’s a broad question that is being asked more and more. And we’re part of answering that question.
Ms. Harding: Mmm hmm, for sure.
Ms. Bingen: If I can jump in on commercial – and I know you’re getting ready to ask some questions here too.
Ms. Harding: No, go for it. 
Ms. Bingen: Is we at CSIS earlier this week unveiled a report called “Gold Rush: The 2024 Commercial Remote Sensing Global Rankings.” So we took inspiration from the Olympics. We did it in partnership with United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation, Taylor Geospatial Engine, Taylor Geospatial Institute. But one of the reasons why we wanted to assess these worldwide commercially available remote sensing systems was to see what the state of competition looks like. And what was surprising in our results is, of all of the winners in different categories of electronic imaging, radar, hyperspectral, et cetera, the sector’s moving really fast.
Roughly half the systems on the podium were ones launched in the last three to four years. China is making incredible inroads in their technologies that they’re now selling commercially. So for us, there was this broader strategic narrative of, you know, what can the government do from a policy regulatory perspective, as a customer, as an investor, to ensure that our companies stay in the lead in the years to come? So all of that is to kind of come back to you. I mean, the NRO is buying data and, you know, leveraging these commercial capabilities. Where do you see that going? And what role is NRO playing in that – the viability, really, of the commercial sector? 
Dr. Scolese: So, you know, our role is to buy the pixels or the data that’s coming back from those satellites, and deliver it to the community, principally our partners at NGA and NSA, but broadly – more broadly than that as well. And today we have a relationship with, I think, all of the U.S. providers that are in the report that you were talking about. And they span a range from we’re just getting to know each other, they may have a new capability or a new idea that they want to bring online so that’s kind of an early phase type of a thing, to demonstrations, which we’re doing, for instance, with the radar community right now that’s proving out to be very well, to contracts where we’re saying, yes, we want your data, you fill a niche, unquestionably, and you can take over this role from the national means, the government-developed systems.
So we cover that range. And we want to work with the commercial community to go off and share what we need. And we do that with our partners, again, at NGA and NSA. To say, these are the types of things that we need so they have an idea of where we’re at. And then if they can develop it, and we’ll work with them to develop it – as I said, we’ve got the range all the way from I’m thinking about it, to I’ve got some examples of what I want to do to, you know, we’re pretty far along that we want you to really try it out, to, yeah, it’s working, and we can – you know, we can count on it. That gives us the opportunity to go off and help nurture that community.
And over – you know, since we started this, about 2018, I think, time frame, we’ve grown the budget, and you know how hard it is to grow a budget, by about 50 percent. So, you know, that shows, you know, a real commitment to working it. And it shows a commitment by the government, right? Because the NRO can propose anything, but there’s many other organizations that have to agree that there’s value there as well. So, you know, the U.S. government is indicating that. And we want to continue to grow it even more as we’re going forward.
Ms. Bingen: That’s a good demand signal. 
Dr. Scolese: Yeah. 
Ms. Harding: Yeah. I just want to put another plug for Kari’s team’s wonderful report, the 2024 Commercial Remote Sensing Global Rankings, which we lovingly refer to as the satellite Olympics. So it’s a really good report. And you can look through it quickly at who’s accomplishing what, in what areas. And you can kind of see the gaps that we as a whole community still need to fill. And I think one thing that really came across to me from the report is the collaboration with allies and how important that collaboration with allies is.
Which actually takes me to our first question, from a CSIS intern, Ianni Nikas: How will cooperation with international allies work for NRO? 
Dr. Scolese: Well, we’re doing a lot more with our international partners. We’ve always sort of had a relationship with the international community. And that’s growing, just like I mentioned commercial is growing. There is great capability that exists with our partners. And we want to take advantage of it. And they would like to work with us. So that’s a – that’s a great relationship. So we are greatly expanding that relationship. And I think it – the fact that we’re doing that makes people that want to keep us from doing things, makes them worry.
And to think about it, you know, we have now – typically we have launched from Florida and California. Over the last four or five years, we’ve launched from New Zealand with our partners there. We’ve launched from the U.K. And we’ve launched from Wallops Island, Virginia. So, you know, that shows international partnership. It also shows a diversification of our launch capabilities, that we can – you know, we can talk about. Because usually it has a little symbol on the rocket, so I can’t say it’s not NRO. (Laughter.) But, you know, I mean that’s just an indication of how much more broadly our international cooperation has grown. 
Ms. Harding: Yeah. We have a question from Vivienne Machi from Aviation Week, that I’m actually going to throw to Kari first because I think it speaks to your background in commercial space as well as in the government areas.
Ms. Bingen: I thought I was the moderator today.
Ms. Harding: (Laughs.) Not going to get off that easy. So on Tuesday at CSIS, representatives of U.S. commercial remote sensing companies reflected upon the current challenges inherent to working with the U.S. government. You shared recently that the NRO is working with a broader swath of industry partners these days, including startups and new space companies. What does the NRO need from commercial space companies that it can’t already do? And what needs to be done, regulatory, policy-wise, for you to work with these vendors? So the reason I’m forcing Kari to answer this question first is because she’s been on both sides of this equation. 
Ms. Bingen: Man, I thought I was going to be the questioner. (Laughter.) No, it’s a great question. And one of the areas that we emphasized in the report was the concept of integration. And, Chris, you mentioned this quite a bit in your discussion today is, you know, so long as commercial is thought of as the separate thing, it’s going to be a cost center, or folks are not going to want to use it. But if you can bring it in – you know, as you start with the baby steps, the ones that you’re thinking about, all the way up to the ones that you’ve got a deep partnership with, is if you can get those capabilities, experimenting with them, integrating them into your tasking cycles, your operations, into the platforms that your analysts use, it’s going to be much more seamless and integrated to them. And they’ll see the value of what commercial brings. But I think on the government side – and I apologize, I’m going to take some of your talk here is – you know, there are things that the government demands that maybe the commercial market doesn’t demand, or in a different way. So some of the security pieces, the supply chain pieces. Yes, the commercial sector cares about that, but the government really, really cares about that. But I’ll tee it up for you. 
Dr. Scolese: I think Kari covered it well.
Ms. Harding: I knew she would. 
Dr. Scolese: So the only thing that I’ll add, you know, from the commercial sector, is, you know, we’ve been talking about space systems, launchers. And – well, we’ve been talk about spacecraft delivering data. It’s broader than that. So everything Kari said. And we definitely want all of that, but to expand it. Commercial launch has helped us incredibly. Commercial spacecraft are allowing us to do a lot of things. It enabled our proliferated architecture. There’s also, you know, the data centers that we need, because we always talk about space. The cloud services are critical to helping us disaggregate our ground systems so that we don’t have one ground system operating everything. We can now disaggregate. 
The developments in data processing, data science, artificial intelligence, those are all areas that we can take advantage of. And they have a lot of crossover, you know, between commercial and what we need on the government end. So I would just expand what Kari said to include those. So those are some of the things that we could we – could go off and take advantage of. 
Ms. Harding: Great. OK.
From Jorge Carlos Arias Delgado from Florida International University: What has been one of the highlights of your career as an engineer and as the director of the NRO?
Dr. Scolese: (Laughs.) Well, as the director of the NRO I guess I can’t tell you. (Laughter.)
But, you know, actually, as one that does actually cover everything, you know, we do – and throughout my career, I’ve been very fortunate. I’ve been able to do some really neat things – build satellites that have looked at the Earth and left the solar system. You know, that’s pretty cool. But, you know, the other thing that I’ve really been very, very fortunate to have is to work with, you know, just great people. You know, just outstanding individuals. And I see them coming in every day. I see it in our interns and everybody else. 
You know, they’re a team. Every organization I’ve been in, it’s been a team. People are driving with the same goals to deliver whatever it is we’re asked to deliver, and finding new and clever ways to go off and do it. So I would say that’s been, you know, the real highlight of my career, great people doing great things. 
Ms. Harding: So, on that front, we have several questions that are coming in that are about that very question. If I wanted to work at the NRO, what are you looking for? What do you want in your people?
Ms. Scolese: Well, we clearly want smart, dedicated people that – in all fields. Because, I mean, we have to build, and design, and operate satellites. So clearly, you know, that’s our engineers, our scientists, our mathematicians. But we also have to know how much they cost, otherwise we won’t get our money, and we won’t know where our money is going, which would be bad. We need contracting officers. We need people that know how to hire people. So we need – we need all disciplines, basically, coming in to work at the – at the NRO. 
But the main thing we really want are people who are really innovative and really committed to going off and doing things that have never been done before and making them a reality. I mean, that’s really what our job is, to go off and deliver the information that’s needed, because technology is going to change, and we have to keep up with it. But, more importantly, as long as there are people that want to do harm to the United States or our allies, there are also people who are capable of challenging us, either technologically or with better ways of hiding things. And we need to stay ahead of that. So we’re always going to be busy. We’re always going to be innovating. So there’ll never be a boring day at the NRO. (Laughter.) 
Ms. Bingen: Can you – I’m going to pick up on Jorge’s question. I know you can’t tell us the details, but give us a hint. Like, what’s really at the leading edge? What excites you about what the NRO is doing, and where it’s really pushing the envelope for these – that young electrical engineer, or social scientist that wants to come work at NRO? What are they going to be doing?
Dr. Scolese: Cool stuff. (Laughter.) You know, it’s very difficult. I mean, you know, from a system standpoint about what we deliver is very hard. But from a technology standpoint, you can definitely say things. I mean, think about what we need in terms of optics. I mean, y’all know we’re looking at the Earth, right? I mean, you take a picture, we’ve been taking pictures. Got to have mirrors. You got to have lenses. You got to have stuff like that. You don’t have to build them all the same way. There are lots and lots of different ways of doing it.
I mean, look at Hubble Space Telescope, and look at James Webb, right? Hubble is a big monolithic mirror. James Webb is a bigger segmented mirror, right? We need to do those kinds of things. You know, think about the processing that we were talking about. Think about putting an NVIDIA chip, an AI system, into space, right? Those are things that that we have to go off and think about. You know, the detectors that we use need to be ever-more sensitive. Which means, you know, solid state – solid state physics is absolutely critical to what we’re doing. We want to make things smaller. So that’s necessary.
And think about the materials that we that we have to go off and use. Now you go off and you talk about those things. You got to have materials that are radiation hardened. They got to be able to take, you know, a relatively rough ride in the rocket. They have to deploy. So we need lots and lots of different capabilities out there. And we operate in a pretty severe regime. And then think about on the ground, where we’ve got to build networks that are, you know, reliable, but also hopefully invincible to cyberattacks. Because that’s the other gift that will keep on giving, right? We’re constantly going to be, you know, having to go off and deal with that. 
And then think about programming. I mean, we always – you know, anybody that’s been an engineer or a scientist, or probably anybody nowadays, has programmed. But we got to get reliable programs that we can trust, right? So how do we go off and do that? So those are some of the areas that, without saying how we’re putting them all together, we’re working in. And we need to go off and really get really, really great people that want to go off and do that. 
Ms. Harding: That’s one of my favorite things about the IC, and working in and with the IC, is that people say it’s impossible. You can’t do that. And they say, OK, hold my beer. (Laughter.) We’re going to figure it out. We’re going to make it happen.
So we have two questions that are on the subject of working with allies, especially allies that are not part of the Five Eyes construct. Jim Schwenk from Tawas USA says: Can you share your thoughts related to working with allied partners that are not within the Five Eyes, especially with all the additional allied space commands being available to enhance supply chain and resiliency through their industrial base? 
And then from our very own Jacob Bradley, who’s one of the interns here at CSIS: Do you feel like your information-sharing and technology-sharing capabilities with our allies and partners lacks? So you’ve got the how are we cooperating together, and then how are we sharing information out as well? 
Dr. Scolese: Yeah. So, you know, our supply chain is global now. I mean, there’s no question about it. And, you know, we’d like to work with our allies because we can, you know, have much higher confidence and trust in what’s going on there. So definitely, you know, we’re working across the spectrum, data sharing where we can. You mentioned, you know, the fact that there are a number of space commands. More importantly, there’s a lot of satellites that are – that are up there in space.
The better we can coordinate our operations in space, while it’s very big – (laughs) – there are still – there are still challenges that we – that we need to deal with, to avoid conjunctions. And the more we share, and we are, that information – typically, we work with Space Command that has that as their responsibility, space management, to get that done. But that also includes all of our allies and partner space development ones that want to operate responsibly in space, so that we can – we can go off and operate there. I think that pretty much covers it.
And then what was the other one, challenges in? 
Ms. Harding: Sharing information back out.
Dr. Scolese: Yeah. I mean, we do share information. Now, again, it’s not the NRO. That’s not our job. I mean, we provide the information. But I do know that, you know, we do share. You have to ask –
Ms. Harding: You promised, we do share.
Dr. Scolese: Yes, we do share. You have to – you have to ask my colleagues at NGA and NSA how that’s done.
Ms. Harding: Right. One more from the audience before I turn it back over to Kari for sort of some closing thoughts, and we could have covered 15,000 more topics, so anything else that we’ve sort of forgotten in our hour today.
But Cal Biesecker from Defense Daily says: Regarding the 100 satellites that will have been launched since last December, are all of these NRO owned? And what will these new satellites enable you to do?
Dr. Scolese: So the answer is yes. They are NRO-owned, if you – if you mean it the sense that, is NRO going to be operating them? The answer is yes. And what are they going to be doing? They are part of the proliferated architecture to go off and get us reasonably high-resolution imagery of the Earth at a high rate of speed. 
Ms. Harding: At a high rate of speed. This is the part about you can’t hide. Yeah, we’re constantly – this idea of persistence. Where you can get constant imagery of what’s going on in a particular place on the planet is just so important, especially if you are, like I was, an intel analyst sitting at their desk trying to figure out, like, has a thing happened yet? It’s invaluable. But over to Kari for final questions and thoughts.
Ms. Bingen: Well, and I am just – you know, when you just take a step back and think, I mean, this is a community that has long had few – little inventory to meet a whole variety of different needs. And now we’re getting to the point where you’re talking dozens to hundreds of satellites, where, in many respects, supply is less of an issue. I now start to think, gosh, that’s much more like Uber than it is, you know, the traditional way of doing business, right? (Laughter.) So how do we think about some of those different kind of models going forward? Or that we’re going to be so heavily reliant on the processing technology that you mentioned, artificial intelligence, automation, all those things.
We’re going to end – I’m going to give you the last word here, but I want to mention a couple of things. And, Chris, you mentioned at the very beginning, which is, you know, it’s the National Reconnaissance Office. There’s much that you – a tremendous amount that you do for providing national intelligence to senior leadership, providing tactical intelligence to warfighters. I remember being – doing trips – when we’ve done congressional trips to Iraq and Afghanistan, and those folks on the edge were receiving data from NRO satellites. But you also have a – really a civil mission there as well, as you’re supporting such a range of customers as well that are not within your traditional national security circle. So I’m going to throw that out at you.
But then also just mention, in the spirit of really being more transparent and talking about what the organization does, is we plan to follow this discussion up with some of your leadership team as well, and different aspects of the NRO mission. So we’re really looking forward to hosting other NRO leaders in the future here within the towers. But, OK, so last words is: Remind us of what you do beyond national security. And then also, looking forward, what does NRO look like in the next 10 to 20 years? Let’s end on that. 
Dr. Scolese: OK. Well, that’s pretty good. So I’ll go back to it’s all about the data that we deliver, and making that available to the appropriate users. So to the civil community, I mean, if you think about some of the challenges that they have and where they need information quickly and reliably, it’s if a natural disaster occurs. And typically, you have limited communications, limited ability to move around.
And you want to know, to a first order, how bad it is and where are the ways that you can move in order to get resources to the people and the communities that need them. If you have the data and you’re delivering it at the pace that it’s needed, you can do that quickly. That’s part of what the NRO does. As well as supporting, you know, other activities. You know, we have a limited role in providing data for climate change and what have you. But I would say that’s a perfect example of where, you know, we’re in there. 
You know, what’s the future going to look like in 10 or 20 years? You know, I’m always, you know, reminded about, you know, people that predict the future. Arthur C. Clarke had a good quote; look it up if you don’t know it. It usually involves, you know, getting it wrong. But you know, I believe the NRO will – there’s still going to be a need to understand what’s going on on this planet, what are humans doing and what is the planet doing. And you know, we’re going to need to continue to adapt to deal with that, and some of the things that we talked about are going to be there. But the one thing I do know is it’ll be a different generation of people that are up there – or, out there; maybe up there, too – that will be doing this, and you know, we need to continue to have, you know, really outstanding people going in there and making sure that we can deliver the information that’s going to be needed in 10 or 20 years, which is going to be different information to that’s needed today.
Ms. Bingen: And Emily and I have both been fortunate we’ve been able to walk the halls of the organization that you lead. And to your point, you know, these engineers, these scientists, the others that work there, I mean, they’re excited to be there. The mission and the technology is really cool. So thank you for all of your leadership and everything that you’re doing to keep our nation safe. 
And if we can also – we’d like to thank some of the staff that supported this event today – so Christina Nordby, Kendra LaFave, and our fantastic streaming and broadcasting team here. 
So again, Dr. Scolese, thank you. 
Dr. Scolese: Thank you. 
Ms. Harding: Thank you. (Applause.)

23,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/peter-schwartzstein-climate-violence-middle-east,Unknown,"October 1, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS podcast published on October 1, 2024. Listen to the podcast here.
Jon Alterman: Peter Schwartzstein, welcome to Babel.
Peter Schwartzstein: Thank you very much for having me back on.
Jon Alterman: One of the themes of your book is that climate exacerbates bad governance. People have talked about how climate causes conflict. People have talked about how climate exacerbates conflict. What do you mean by climate exacerbates bad governance?
Peter Schwartzstein: I think of climate as amplifying a society's existing fissures or weaknesses. When you have a place that is suffering from varying degrees of state mismanagement, climate change reduces that already poorly governed state’s capacity to deliver various services such as fresh water, sufficient sewage disposals, and affordable food. It ensures that they're even less capable of providing those services than they previously were.
Jon Alterman: There are a number of scholars who've been looking at the nexus between climate and conflict. You've read all their books. What do you think they're either getting wrong, or what do they need to focus on that they're not focusing on?
Peter Schwartzstein: I'm always wary of bricking on my peers, given that so much of what I've done owes a tremendous debt to the work that's come before me. But perhaps I also have a journalist’s slight prejudice against the manner in which some scholars and academics go about their work. There's too much focus on the minutiae of a subject and insufficient focus on the bigger picture.
For example, take the conflict in Syria. From about 2013, there was an enormous amount of coverage on the supposed extent to which climate change contributed to the beginnings of the revolution that then bled into the civil war. That, in turn, led to this enormous backlash from various scholars who insisted with a degree of reason, but only a degree of reason, that many sensationalist parts of media had massively overstated the influence of climate change. That's all true, but as is so often the case, there's a very real middle ground in which the research and groundwork that I've done over many years in Syria, and that of many of my peers have done, shows that climate change was very much a factor, just not the be-all and end-all that slightly shoddy articles at one point or other suggested.
Jon Alterman: You had examples of the government adulterating fertilizer, which would have been a problem in an earlier time, but in the face of climate change, it becomes catastrophic.
Peter Schwartzstein: Absolutely. I've tried to steer clear of Syria just because of the extent to which that did monopolize coverage of the conflict-climate space, but I lead with it because it's unavoidable, and I wanted to provide an example as to one of the ways in which climate change did actually play a part. As you alluded to, for many years in the run-up to 2011, farmers in northeast Syria in particular, which was the most agrarian part of the country, had to put up with the same kind of volumes of corruption from these kickback-seeking officials as their peers elsewhere in the country.
But as that drought intensified and continued through the years in the run-up to 2011, these farmers' willingness and ability to put up with those bribe-seeking demands decreased. At a time when their harvests were failing and crop yields were shrinking, officials were coming back demanding the same sums of cash that farmers were now even less capable of providing and hampering farmers with lower quality seeds and fertilizers at a time of their greatest need. This meant that the degree of rage at that corruption was even higher. When I try and look at how climate change contributes to other drivers of instability, such as corruption or inequality, that's really what I'm driving at.
Jon Alterman: We first spoke on Babel five years ago. What's changed between the conversation we had five years ago and what you're seeing on the ground now?
Peter Schwartzstein: I'll give you one way in which things have become worse and one way in which they've become better. First, the general environment and climate prognosis in the Middle East has only worsened over the past few years. This is a region which has roughly 6 percent of the world's population and about 1.5 percent of its freshwater resources. The mismatch between available supply and demand is only widening. At the same time, quality of governance has by and large only worsened across the board, ensuring that the impact of those worsening and intensifying climate stresses is felt more profoundly. That's the change for the worse. Things on that count are becoming more debilitating almost by the year.
The good change is, as you might have seen over the past year or two, that there has been this rash of transboundary water, environment, and climate initiatives across the region, particularly in the Gulf. Now, many of these are purely rhetorical. They're not really meant to get off the ground, and some of them are opportunistic initiatives that sound good, but ultimately stand little prospect of generating meaningful change. However, the very fact that we're seeing more and more of these initiatives is a massive net positive, even if most of them lead to very little concrete action.
That's because, a lot of the time, you're having interaction between different parts of government that wouldn't otherwise happen. That's almost always a net positive. Then equally, this does seem to illustrate the fact that some of these countries with their often complicated, to put it lightly, relations with one another, really are seeking to at least partly divorce climate, water, and environment from their wider relationships. There is an understanding that this can't really be a zero-sum issue, and that this really can and should be at least partly disconnected from the wider dynamic.
Jon Alterman: You've spoken to more people in more places about climate and conflict than anybody I've come across in this field. What do you see as the most important similarities across regions and countries? What are some of the important differences, and is there any difference that you see between the Middle East context and the South Asian context that your book also explores?
Peter Schwartzstein: One of the key points of similarity is that it's at a very local level between communities, villages, and various subnational actors like provinces and governorates in an Iraqi context, where resource-related violence is really mushrooming. That's true of the Middle East, and that's true of parts of Africa and South Asia, as well. Now, we know that at a global level, there are more conflicts within countries than at any point since the Second World War. A lot of the time that's because there is more incentive for violence at a local level than there is between nation states, where countries are aware that there's limited prospect of pilfering additional resources from one's neighbor. Unfortunately, it's often a rather different situation at a local level.
That's a key similarity. Points of difference? I’d have to rack my brain here. For me, someone who's done most of my work in different parts of the Middle East and North and East Africa, the captivating thing is the relative absence of water.
In South Asia, a lot of the time there’s an issue of excess water, but also, the degree of variation in South Asia is extra problematic. The monsoon has sometimes been described only half-jokingly as the real finance minister of South Asia. The Indians, Pakistanis, and Bangladeshis of the world are acutely vulnerable to this increasingly fickle series of seasonal rains, which arguably places them at an even greater risk than many of their Middle Eastern peers who don't have enough water but aren't necessarily suffering with quite the same degree of seasonal variations as their peers elsewhere.
Jon Alterman: Does that suggest that in South Asia, more of the emphasis should be placed on large scale infrastructure, and in the Middle East, more emphasis should be placed on community-based or locally based initiatives to distribute scarce water? Or are there other conclusions we should draw from that?
Peter Schwartzstein: It varies a lot through different parts of South Asia and the Middle East. Really, we need everything. In some instances, we need a return to the kinds of nature-based or indigenous solutions that are sometimes excessively fetishized, but nevertheless play their role. I'm talking here of things like the karez systems that we've historically had in parts of Iran and northern Iraq, as well as the falaj system in Oman and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. They can play a role to a certain extent. Equally, there are places, especially in Saudi Arabia and other parts of the Middle East, in which enhanced and more efficient desalination is, unfortunately, likely the only solution, despite the many potential pitfalls.
Then in parts of South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa alike, there's going to be some really tough policy levers that states have to pull. There are places in which agriculture is no longer viable, no matter what kinds of infrastructure is built and no matter what kinds of support is offered to farmers. From a psychological point of view, that's extremely difficult. There's a desire to at least have partial mastery over your food supplies in places in which denial of food access or rising food prices has often been fatal for regimes. However, you have places in which the nature of climate stresses mixed in with the nature of environmental degradation ensures that farming just isn't viable. The understandable unwillingness on the part of authorities in parts of Jordan and Iraq to recognize that will, unfortunately, stand these places in in ever poor stead as we go on.
Jon Alterman: The Rutgers historian, Toby Jones, who wrote about Saudi Arabia in the 1970s, talked about how the Saudis had turned oil into water. They had used the oil resources to dig into aquifers and make Saudi Arabia one of the world's largest wheat producers for a while. I was surprised that aquifers didn't play a larger role in your book. As you know, aquifers have been very important to agriculture in a number of arid places. Aquifers are a bit difficult because you can't see them, so you don't really know that they're shrinking. Although certainly, the water table in places like Yemen is dropping precipitously. Are aquifers a piece of this? Why were they not a focus of what you wrote about?
Peter Schwartzstein: It's partly a function of where I've kind of centered much of my work. The Arabian Peninsula has not been as significant of an area of research for me as it has for many others. But in the places where I have done much of my work—Jordan, Iraq, and Syria—part of the issue is that we just don't have anywhere near as much data as we need. Now, this is a classic, recurring problem across the region in which either data doesn't exist, or it's not made widely available by authorities.
People often look at aquifers, especially farmers and municipal water authorities, as some kind of magical alternative source of water that can be turned to at a time when the rains are not falling as they previously did. This is a massive issue, because we have a wealth of anecdotal evidence, if not statistics, to show that groundwater levels are falling at a pace that simply can't be sustained for much longer.
In Jordan, a country which is more groundwater dependent than almost any other in the region, approximately 10 out of the country's 12 main non-renewable aquifers are being pumped dry. As of a few years ago, Amman and the popular cities to its north are mostly dependent on the Disi aquifer near the Saudi border. Now, when that aquifer runs dry, because it is non-renewable, at some point in the next 10, 15, 20, or 25 years maximum, nobody really knows what's going to come next or where the authorities are going to turn to for that irreplaceable source of current supply. This is a real “watch this space” issue.
Jon Alterman: One of the things that we're seeing people talk about around the world is the energy transition and a shift toward renewables. That certainly is not going to end a lot of the disruptions we see because of climate change, but it also seems that the energy transition can have its own disruptions in many states. As you think about your experience throughout the Middle East, what kinds of disruptions do you expect to see because of the energy transition and a shift toward renewables?
Peter Schwartzstein: Like you, I go to some of the same conferences across the region and I sometimes walk away shaking my head thinking that so many folks here, including these extremely clever, very “switched-on” people are just sort of walking into the abyss. That abyss is a world with less fossil fuel usage, which is absolutely vital for some of the reasons we've touched on. But for countries like Iraq and Libya, which derive over 90 percent of their state revenues from oil and gas, there is next to no conversation on anything like the scale necessary as to what comes when the lifeblood of those economies slowly dissipates.
The EU forecasts that by 2050, it will have around a 79 percent reduction in its consumption of oil and gas. If anything like that alone comes true, then that's punching a yawning gap in the balance sheets of basically every petro-state in the region. I've talked to an array of Iraqi senior policymakers in particular, from the former president and the former prime minister downwards, and they still talk about this as if it's some sort of hypothetical, vague future threat, rather than something that will come their way even if we don't move away from oil and gas at the speed or to the full extent that is necessary. This is a speeding bullet heading the way of so many of the regional regimes, and so few of them seem to be making the adequate preparations.
Jon Alterman: You and I have also spent a lot of time in Egypt. How do you think this is going to unfold in a place like Egypt, which has a lot of infrastructure and a lot of people who need transportation and cooling? How does this play out there?
Peter Schwartzstein: On balance, I fear that it will not play out well. Egypt, in theory, has quite a lot going for it in this perspective. It's got a large chunk of what's known as the solar belt, which is a swathe of reliably sunny territory in the far south where one could generate not only enough energy to supply Egypt's own needs, but arguably and quite possibly the energy needs of a chunk of Europe as well.
Jon Alterman: Is it really of the scale where they could meet all of their electricity needs domestically as well as export?
Peter Schwartzstein: In theory, yes. It's just a question of whether they could get anything like the start-up capital needed to build sufficient solar facilities. There's also the issue of needing the storage capacity to hold themselves over during the nighttime hours and during those rare windows when the sun doesn't shine. All of this requires quality governance. It requires anything but the relatively chronic short-term thinking that we've seen from Cairo and so many other capitals. Even among states like Egypt that do have some of the tools to begin making this transition, we're just not seeing the degree of management necessary.
Jon Alterman: And profound amounts of capital. Jordan has been very interested in building its solar capacity. The United States has been investing in that and trying to wean Iraq off Iranian energy by having Jordanian exports. It still seems like it is relatively small-scale and slow in a place that is 10 percent the size of Egypt and relatively better governed.
Peter Schwartzstein: When it comes to renewables, Jordan is more than a relative success story. It's gone from having around 10 to 12 percent of its electricity needs met by renewables to more than tripling that in the past decade. Given the fact that these solar panels and other associated bits of infrastructure keep on absolutely plummeting in cost, there's plenty of reason to envisage them making significantly greater gains in the years ahead. In climate discourse, this is one of the massive sources of optimism at a time when a lot else is not going right.
The economic competitiveness of renewables is extraordinary. At this point, they are not just matching, but in some places, they are massively outpacing oil and gas. For places like Egypt, Jordan, and further afield where it is cost and almost cost alone that is the key driving factor, that’s really important and good news.
Jon Alterman: What about the costs of moving away from all the infrastructure that is built around fossil fuels and electrifying everything into a sophisticated grid? Is there money to do that in places like Egypt, Jordan, and Iraq?
Peter Schwartzstein: In Egypt and Jordan, I don't think so. It would require not only a lot of international assistance but also the kinds of private sector investment that we don't yet seem to see. In the Gulf and, in theory, Iraq, there are some of the sums of money necessary to begin making that happen during periods when oil prices are perhaps a little bit higher than they currently are. I used to get asked by western diplomats in Baghdad, “What would it take for Iraq to begin addressing its water issues and treating them with the appropriate seriousness?” I used to say with relative conviction, “It will take a massive crisis, and at that point they'll have to act whether they want to or not.”
Then along came the 2018 super drought, and approximately 120,000 people were hospitalized for waterborne illnesses in the Basra area. Some quick fixes aside, the Iraqi state did very little. My confidence that crises will begin to shake states out of their torpor has been quite seriously shaken.
Jon Alterman: In Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, rather than relying on solar, there's been an investment in nuclear power. According to some assessments, even though that's a multibillion-dollar, decade-long operation to get going, it's still a better bet than large-scale solar.
Peter Schwartzstein: I'm not an energy expert. I'm going to move a little beyond this to add that the concentration of key resources, in either the form of desalination facilities or nuclear facilities, is a dangerous and possibly messy phenomenon in a region where, for example, the Houthis have attacked some of Saudi Arabia's desalination facilities, thereby massively reducing the volume of fresh water that the Saudi state was able to provide to its citizens for a period. We've had similar things playing out with some of Israel's desalination facilities over the years.
Arguably, in a region which doesn't look like it's going to reach necessary degrees of stability and peacefulness anytime soon, one of the key advantages behind wind, solar, and other forms of dispersed renewables is the way in which that can be partly insulated from broader chaos.
Jon Alterman: There's a large theme at the end of your book about environmental peacemaking and peacebuilding, as well as the role that environment can and should play in healing some of the divisions in the region. A lot of the examples you have are international ones, especially around Arab-Israeli issues. What are the unexploited opportunities to do environmental peacemaking domestically, and why haven't more of them been exploited?
Peter Schwartzstein: From a Middle Eastern context, this environmental peacebuilding idea has a lot of attractions, and I would also argue, a lot of potential. As I alluded to with this raft of transboundary initiatives in the environment, climate, and water space, I think there is a recognition among authorities in the Gulf and perhaps elsewhere that you can kill two birds with one stone. You can achieve slightly superior environmental outcomes while also reducing the prospects of conflict. Now even in the Tigris-Euphrates basin sense, there's been a lot of water-related negotiations over the years, mostly behind the scenes. I'm only privy to sort of small bits of it.
There's an argument to be made that even though the lower Zab, one of the Tigris’ key tributaries, more or less ran dry last week and doesn't look like much of a success story, the absence of additional tensions or forms of violence that might have existed otherwise, can be a success story in relative terms. There's a lot of utility to be had here.
Jon Alterman: Is there an international edge in helping domestic efforts and environmental peacebuilding? Why should international actors be concerned with domestic environmental peacebuilding?
Peter Schwartzstein: As we perhaps ought to have learned over the years, problems in one place don't remain self-contained messes. This is one of the key arguments to be made for aiding climate action elsewhere. You don't necessarily have to do it for the sake of justice, but you should do it because it's in your own self-interest. When it comes to tackling climate stresses at large in the Middle East, Africa, and poorer parts elsewhere in the world, or when it comes to helping to resolve or in some way mitigate these environment or non-environment-related domestic disputes, it's in our interest. Those can bleed into issues that we do deeply care about, from migration to radicalization to the rise of various non-state groups, which—as I cover in the first chapter of the book—thrive in these ungoverned, climate-battered vacuums.
I spent the best part of three years looking at how the Islamic State group in rural parts of Iraq and Syria profited from collapsing agricultural conditions to bolster its ranks. At no point am I arguing that this is a climate fueled phenomenon alone, but it would not have been able to secure anything like the number of fighters that it initially did, were it not for the fact that you had this climate-battered, rural expanse in which jobs were disappearing at an extraordinary pace, farmers were living off a fraction of the volume of money that they deemed to be viable, and most particularly, that farmers weren't receiving any of the support that they felt entitled to. That added to an array of other grievances and resentment. That's a global story. Failed states, as we have learned over the years, are in nobody's interest.
Jon Alterman: Peter Schwartzstein, thank you very much for joining us once again on Babel.
Peter Schwartzstein: Thank you very much. I look forward to making it a hat trick a number of years into the future.

24,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/looming-uncertainty-special-relationship,Max Bergmann,"September 26, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This commentary is part of a report from the CSIS Geopolitics and Foreign Policy Department entitled The Global Impact of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. The report features a set of essays assessing the meaning of the election for Europe, Russia, Eurasia, the Indo-Pacific, the Americas, Africa, and the Middle East. The United Kingdom is not usually known for its July 4 celebrations, but this year it held a general election to mark the day. By the time the next U.S. president is elected, Sir Keir Starmer, whose center-left Labour government won the election by a landslide, will have been in power for five months. The United Kingdom is a major power with a global outlook and remains the closest U.S. ally. Establishing a common agenda with London should be a priority in the first 100 days of a Harris or Trump administration.
Two Diverging Paths
The outcome of the U.S. election could have a significant impact on the U.S.-UK special relationship—so called because it is the closest and deepest relationship Washington shares with any other nation. As a member of the UN Security Council and G7; a nuclear weapons power; and a leading global military, cyber, and science power, the United Kingdom is a powerful ally for Washington. Recent examples include support to Ukraine, where the United Kingdom has trained thousands of troops since 2014. The United Kingdom has consistently led Europe in providing aid to Ukraine since 2022, including being first to give Kyiv main battle tanks and long-range missiles. The United Kingdom has also executed joint U.S.-UK strikes in response to Houthi attacks in the Red Sea and participated in the AUKUS initiative with the United States to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines and develop advanced technology.
Traditionally, the U.S.-UK relationship has been strong regardless of the political parties occupying the White House or 10 Downing Street. For instance, former UK prime minister Tony Blair had strong relations with Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Yet the outcome of this election holds two very divergent tracks for the special relationship.
Should Trump win the election, the United States and United Kingdom would have two leaders from different ends of the political spectrum. This situation would create a very different dynamic from Trump’s first term, when the United Kingdom had conservative leaders and had just voted for Brexit, which Trump also strongly supported. In particular, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his similar brand of populist politics meant the United Kingdom maintained much closer relations with Washington than other European allies. Under Starmer, the UK leader will face cross-cutting pressures. On the one hand, the United Kingdom has a long-standing foreign policy objective to maintain the special relationship. As new foreign secretary David Lammy has stated: “We should not fail to recognise that the US will remain the UK’s most essential ally, whoever occupies the White House.” On the other hand, Trump remains deeply unpopular in the United Kingdom, especially among Labour supporters. Furthermore, Blair’s decision to invade Iraq, standing with the Bush administration and breaking with France and Germany, has been heavily criticized. Thus, Starmer may face political pressures to confront Trump along the lines of the movie Love Actually, in which a fictional UK prime minister portrayed by Hugh Grant patriotically stands up to the U.S. president portrayed by Billy Bob Thornton.
Should Harris win, however, there will be an opportunity to revive the special relationship. U.S.-UK relations have lost some of their significance to Washington following Brexit, as the United Kingdom’s influence in Europe has been greatly diminished. But with Starmer and Harris being cut from the same political cloth and with both being former prosecutors, there could be opportunity to revive the significance and closeness of the relationship. The United Kingdom’s overall approach to foreign policy under Labour, described as “Britain Reconnected” and “Progressive Realism,” could align well with a Harris administration. A recent essay in Foreign Affairs by David Lammy explains how Progressive Realism “advocates using realist means to pursue progressive ends.” Labour is also seeking to rebuild its relationship with the European Union, which a Harris government would strongly support.
What a Harris or Trump Administration Should Focus on in Its First 100 Days
The UK agenda usefully highlights several policy priorities for a new U.S. administration to focus on in its first 100 days.
Reconnecting with Europe. A new White House of either stripe should support a stronger relationship between the United Kingdom and Europe for the simple reason that this would support the main U.S. foreign policy goal: to compete with China. A unified European position on China is a stronger one. A UK-EU security pact would also strengthen cooperation on security and the defense industry, meaning a stronger “European pillar” of NATO to deter Russia and a Europe less reliant on the United States to support Ukraine and defend itself. Moreover, Washington lost its traditional bridge with Europe after Brexit, so Starmer restoring good relations with Europe from outside the European Union would be a boon for Harris or Trump.
Strengthening UK defense. The United Kingdom’s ongoing Strategic Defence Review—which is set to conclude by July 2025—will hopefully lead to a stronger UK military. One immediate priority will be maintaining momentum on the AUKUS agreement, which helps Australia play its part to counter Chinese aggression. AUKUS also highlights the crucial UK-U.S. nuclear relationship. The long-standing UK-U.S. Mutual Defense Agreement is set to expire at the end of 2024 and will therefore be an early priority for a new administration.
Trade agreement. The United Kingdom made no headway negotiating a new free trade agreement during Trump’s first term, and with Trump now pledging to increase tariffs, a second administration would be unlikely to make much progress. Further, the Biden administration made no efforts to negotiate a new trade deal, as the administration, as well as Congress, appears deeply skeptical of trade agreements. It is unclear whether a Harris administration would adopt the same approach. However, a new Labour government could be an ideal partner for negotiating a new type of progressive fair trade agreement focused on the green economy. If the United States cannot do a trade deal with the United Kingdom, it is unlikely to make trade agreements with anyone.
Climate action and green energy. The prospective Harris and Trump agendas diverge significantly on this area. Harris at least should recruit the United Kingdom as a key ally in the green transition, as its Clean Power Alliance offers a new format to pursue cutting-edge climate diplomacy.
 The U.S.-UK relationship is likely strong enough to survive any storm. But a Harris administration would likely offer far smoother sailing for the special relationship than another Trump administration.

25,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/hussein-ibish-popular-mobilization-october-7th,Unknown,"September 17, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS podcast published on September 18, 2024. Listen to the podcast here. Jon Alterman: Hussein Ibish, welcome to Babel.
Hussein Ibish: Thank you so much, Jon. It's a real honor to be here with you. Thank you.
Jon Alterman: On October 17th, protests swept the Arab world after accusations that Israel had bombed the al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza. But rather than grow, all those protests seemed to level off. Why is the Arab street not in open revolt about Gaza?
Hussein Ibish: Well, because there is no “Arab street.” It's a term that should be retired. It should never have been imported from French into English and then into the Arab world. There is no Arab street. There are Arab public opinions, and there's 24 national subsets within a huge kaleidoscope of sub-national subsets based on differences of class, ethnicity, tribe, and clan.
All these differences make for a really complicated sociopolitical scene in the Arab world. The birth of Arab nationalism, which was kind of an importation of a European model of a post-Westphalian nation statehood, especially the nineteenth-century ethnocultural nationalism that dominated Europe, was not really suited to a post-Ottoman Middle East, frankly.
Within these structures, you have a myriad of different national and subnational identifications, right? There was this expectation during the period of Arab nationalism, during and after the Nasser era, that all Arabs were prototype Arab nationalists, and all they needed was the chance to demonstrate their Pan-Arab nationalism. Then, they would unify, and they would love it.
People expected unity out of Nasserite Arab nationalism, and they didn't get it. Then, they expected Islamism to at least take over in the Arab republics after the fall of dictators during the Arab Spring. The Muslim Brothers, the Qataris, and the Turks expected it. A lot of people on the left and the right in the West expected it as well because most Arabs are devout Muslims, so they thought most Arabs were proto-Islamists. It turns out that wasn’t the case at all, because there are competing values. The Arab political culture is a lot more variegated and complex than people say.
Jon Alterman: But certainly, the Palestinian cause was something that people cared about and would get people on the street.
Hussein Ibish: Does the Palestinian cause stir heartstrings? It does. Did it then? Yes, it did from its very outset, and it has always stirred heartstrings. I'm sure it always will. It is unreasonable to expect Arabs to undo their domestic societies because a subset of Palestinians is being brutalized by Israel because of an action taken by Hamas. That's very important. If it happened absent October 7th, it would've been very different, but I think people have a lot of hesitations about Hamas.
I also want to point out that Gaza is not a place that resonates with a lot of people in the Arab or broader Muslim world. It commands a lot of attention among Palestinians, a lot of Israelis, and some Egyptians. That's it. But generally, it doesn't have a lot of resonance the way East Jerusalem does. If Al-Aqsa Mosque, or even any part of occupied East Jerusalem, had been involved in this, it would have stirred heartstrings. But Gaza doesn't. It's very important to understand people have their doubts about Hamas and to them, when they think about Gaza, they question, ""Where exactly is this?""
While there's a lot of anger, who to aim it at is not clear. When you are demonstrating in Morocco, Saudi Arabia, or Iraq, ultimately, if you're sensible, you know you're demonstrating largely against the local forces. Why would the Israelis care if somebody's demonstrating in Morocco or Saudi Arabia? That's another problem. How does that help Palestinians?
Jon Alterman: One of the explanations for why there aren't more protests in the Arab world is because Arab governments fear that if there were protests, they would rapidly turn into anti-local government protests. Having learned the lessons from the Arab Spring, governments don't want to open that door. There's another argument, which is that people are principally concerned with their daily lives, and Palestine preoccupied an earlier generation that was looking for an issue to unite around. However, this generation is interested in jobs, getting married, and consumer culture.
Hussein Ibish: There's a lot of truth to the second explanation. The first explanation is manifestly wrong for a couple of reasons. First, you have not seen an effort by Arab governments to suppress nascent demonstrations, to show people a whiff of grapeshot, or to scare them back into their homes. You really haven't seen that.
I think it served some of the regimes. Take the Sisi regime in Egypt, which is a really repressive government. Their reaction to anti-Israel, pro-Hamas, and anti-war protests in Egypt was not to say, “You mustn't,” but to say, ""Great idea. Go do it next to the pyramids."" In other words, in the middle of nowhere where it wouldn't matter. Now that didn't work, so they had to allow people to do it a bit in Cairo. By allowing the protests without trying to suppress them in a violent way or in a mass “incarcerator” way, they've let off some steam.
There are two kinds of Arab societies where you've seen major public expressions of disruptive and unruly outrage. The first are places with a lot of Iranian influence, with organizations connected to Iran's so-called “Axis of Resistance,” of which Hamas is kind of a junior member in bad standing, but still a member. They can get people out in Beirut, Tehran, and Iraq.
Then, you've them where there are lots of Palestinians. Jordan was he place that really was threatened, and where the government was actually worried. Jordan had the most passionate, most unruly, and least controlled demonstrations. Jordan is the place where these demonstrations hint at or point towards a very different kind of domestic political arrangement. The Jordanian regime had to tread very carefully between allowing protests and suppressing protests. They decided to allow them and hoped they would peter out, and they sort of have. However, they have been destabilizing to state and society. They brought to the fore the uneasy social contract between Jordanians, who support the Hashemite monarchy, and Palestinian Jordanians, who are about half of the population, maybe even more. After Black September, in 1969 and 1970, the most extreme wings of the PLO, the PFLP, took over some parts of Jordan and turned them into a de facto Palestinian state for the purpose of waging guerilla war against Israel.
In Amman, there was a war, and the Palestinian national movement was driven from Jordan into Lebanon. Since then, the basic social contract has been, ""You can live here as citizens, you can do anything you like, but don't pursue your national aspirations in Jordan. Pursue them in Palestine, in the West Bank, in Gaza, in Israel, or somewhere else, just not here.”
This conflict brings to the fore the fact that the worse things get between Israelis and Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, the higher the likelihood that large numbers of additional Palestinians end up in Jordan from the West Bank, driven out or fleeing conflict, as Israel ends up annexing chunks of the West Bank.
Jon Alterman: Of course, most Palestinians in the West Bank have Jordanian citizenship, so they have that ability to move.
Hussein Ibish: They can renew their Jordanian citizenship. There's a real issue there. In addition, there's been this Israeli mantra for many decades that Jordan is Palestine, and the Jordanians fear that that could become true if the Palestinians cannot pursue self-determination in Mandatory Palestine.
Jon Alterman: Let me go back to your first answer about the nature of protests in the Arab world and this idea of voice. As you know, Marc Lynch wrote a book in 2007 called Voices of the New Arab Public. It feels to me that after 2011 in the Arab Spring uprisings, maybe there was some learned helplessness, and Arab publics decided a lot of these issues are the ambit of governments and not really for the public to challenge. Are you seeing some of that at play here as people talk about Gaza?
Hussein Ibish: I think that's true. We saw what uncontrolled bottom-up change can look like when dictators fell. It didn't look good anywhere. Even Tunisia has gone backwards majorly. The whole democratization program has been a failure everywhere for now. None of the essential grievances of the Arab Spring have been resolved in any way. I fully expect all those issues to come back at some point and probably with a vengeance. I think there is, you could call it learned helplessness, or you could call it acquired wisdom. Either way, the idea that uncontrolled bottom-up change is a good idea and that it will work out well has been discredited.
It is similar to the way the Muslim Brotherhood Project became discredited over the same period of time for many of the same reasons. Most Arabs don't want it, and they won't put up with it if you try to shove it down their throat. They'd rather stick with the old regimes that better lives.
There is a sense that the chaos version of change is not popular. At the same time, you have a great surge of nationalism. There was a competing value when the Islamists were fighting for power during the Arab Spring decade of 2011 to around 2019, which was that even though the Brothers had the Qur’an, other people had the flag, and the flag was at least as powerful as the Qur’an. Some of the people with the flag could grab the Qur’an and pull it back, which happened in Libya, and say, ""Hey, I know this book as well as you do. Don't tell me I'm not as good a Muslim as you just because I'm not fundamentalist. Get lost. Besides, you're a traitor."" This is maybe a worse term than an apostate, frankly, in a lot of these countries.
For example, in the Gulf a country like Saudi Arabia has undergone a complete transformation of its government legitimation narrative. It used to be heavily based on the Islamic heritage of Saudi Arabia. Now it's partly that, but more the kind of history of power, authority, and military conquest of the Saud family representing Saudi national interests going all the way back to the eighteenth century, but before Abd al-Wahhab. The origin story of the modern Saudi state is no longer said to be in the pact between the Saudis and Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. It's now dated to an earlier Saudi conquest, and the military prowess and authority of the Sauds as a ruling family. You see this all over.
You've got a Saudi-first agenda. You've got an Emirati-first agenda, where there's been a huge emphasis in the past 10 years in the UAE on national service and other programs designed to take these seven emirates and make people believe they are UAE citizens and not people from Ras Al-Khaimah, or Abu Dhabi, or Dubai, or Sharjah. No, you're an Emirati first. There is something similar in Qatar, especially due to the boycott. All over the Arab world there was a resurgence of patriotism as part of a backlash to the Islamist moment, which fizzled. But it's not Pan-Arab nationalism, it’s domestic nationalism and state-specific nationalism. That's one thing that Arab societies that remain functional are trying to foster as a bulwark against the state failure of a lot of the republics like Iraq and Lebanon, Syria, Libya, etc. The idea that it's not enough just to have a monarchy. You need to also have a patriotic citizenry that conflates the two.
Jon Alterman: Does Gaza sort of consolidate that inflection point that you felt was really captured by the Arab Spring? Is there a way in which Gaza consolidates it? Does it move it? Is Gaza part of a new kind of Arab politics? Does it accelerate a new kind of Arab politics?
Hussein Ibish: That's to be determined. If the war ends soon, it's likely we'll look back on this as an inflection point that consolidates the new nationalism, the new domestic nationalism, and the death of Islamist projects in the Arab world for now. One of the things holding people back from embracing everything about the Gaza war is that they don't want to help Hamas. It's not just true of governments. It's true of people. And October 7th was not designed to make them love Hamas if they didn't like them in the first place.
More to the point, none of it really felt like a great idea in most of the Arab world in theory. That does hold people back. However, Hamas knew they were going to be sacrificing what they had built in Gaza and throwing over the apple cart, embracing what they said they wanted, which was a state of permanent war with Israel—an open-ended insurgency. I wrote about this around December 12th in the Atlantic. I said, ""This is a trap. Israel's walking into a trap."" What I meant was that the Israelis were being lured into a first phase where they would do what they did from north to south, ending at Rafah. However, then they wouldn't go. As long as they are there, it gives Hamas the opportunity to have the war they want.
The war Hamas wants is an open-ended insurgency against Israeli forces that will give them every week, if not every day, a bloody shirt they can wave in front of the other Palestinians and say, ""We are the national movement. We are the only ones who are fighting and dying for control of Palestinian land, here in Gaza, against the Israeli occupiers. Look at those idiots in the West Bank. What are they doing? They are the gendarmerie of the occupation, and the PLO sits at an empty negotiating table where no good can come of it. We are the leaders, so we should take over the PLO and be there in the UN.""
They're playing a long game. They're thinking in terms of 10, 15 years. And they're thinking in terms of Palestinian politics. This is very consequential. If the Israelis stay in Gaza, and they provide Hamas with the open-ended insurgency they want, it will immediately become a quagmire for Israel because it will lack a goal. It will lack a strategy. It will just be a self-reinforcing Whack-A-Mole. You see that in every counterinsurgency that's open-ended unless you build up a political alternative, which would mean doing that while building up the PA in the West Bank, but the Israelis don't want that at this point, anyway.
If it just continues the way it is, as Netanyahu seems to want, this could be the beginning of an Islamist resurgence led by Hamas. That is not impossible. At the moment, the Arab reaction to the war in Gaza is held back by the fact that it's being led by Hamas. But over a five, seven, eight-year period, you could see that pendulum swing completely where Hamas becomes the vanguard, not just of the Palestinian national movement, but of Arab sentiments in general and the revival of an Islamist trend. I find that entirely plausible. It's one of the many of the worst of the “parade of horribles” that precedes from Netanyahu's policy of generally making this into the war that Sinwar wants.
Jon Alterman: How do you think Hamas is doing on the information warfare piece? How do you see it? What do you think its principal instruments are and its principal storylines?
Hussein Ibish: Its principal instruments are the statements that very effective Hamas spokespeople make on Telegram, Signal, other social media, and sometimes even on the news. It's the spin that is given by Hamas diplomats in Qatar, who used to pretend to be their political leaders but never were, and now it's official that Sinwar is in charge. And it’s the fact that Israel's propaganda is so bad. Israel's ability to explain what the hell they're doing has been so poor because they haven't known.
The biggest bolster for Hamas here is the way Israel has conducted the war, which has been a war of vengeance. On October 7th, Netanyahu got on Israeli TV and promised ""a mighty vengeance."" That's a direct quote, and that's exactly what's happened in Gaza. Nothing else has been accomplished, to my mind, except a mighty vengeance. The whole society has suffered to the point of Gaza delenda est. This is how I see it, and a lot of the Arab world sees it that way, even if other people don't. I think it's kind of obvious. Under such circumstances, people are genuinely outraged. So, first of all, Israel's own behavior is Hamas' best communications victory.
Secondly, Israel has not been able to articulate why it's doing what it's doing except in its own context. Among Jewish Israelis, and I think even other Israelis, it works okay because people feel threatened, so vengeance, war sounds good. To the rest of the world, it just looks like a rampage, to a large extent, because it was a rampage. Under such circumstances, all Hamas has to do is to say, ""We're surviving, we're here, and here are the number of people who died. Here is what they did today. Here is what we suffered today."" Israel is still stuck on October 8th or 9th or 10th. They're still emotionally transfixed in the horror of October 7th, and that's understandable for Israeli society. For the the rest of the world, however, it is not. It’s been really helpful for Hamas.
On the other hand, October 7th sentences Hamas to be a non-player for the foreseeable future in Palestinian national representation. There is no way that Hamas can become a respectable interlocutor. They have made themselves the de facto Palestinian-Israel interlocuter on matters of war and peace. That's mainly because of the extent to which Israel has marginalized and belittled the PA and the PLO in the West Bank. It’s not so much a victory of Hamas; rather, it's walking into a vacuum. It would not be that difficult to create a plausible Palestinian alternative to Hamas just by rebuilding Fatah and the PA, which you can do with incentives, money, support, and with a series of measures, and benchmarks that if the PA meets, then they get this much more power, independence, and money. That's absolutely never been tried. Maybe the death of Abbas might be an opportunity to try to do it. He is sort of the living embodiment of the condition of Fatah.
Jon Alterman: He’s 88 with a smoking habit.
Hussein Ibish: Yeah. 88 with a smoking habit. You wonder what kind of battery is behind there. But you've still got an opportunity, in my view, to take the Gaza war and October 7th and use it to create something better among Palestinians. But you have to be willing to do it. If you keep backhanding the PA and refusing to give them their own money and siccing settlers on everybody like the Ku Klux Klan nightriders, it's not going to work.
Jon Alterman: But as you said, Hamas has not been skillful in many ways.
Hussein Ibish: My point is that they haven't needed to be skillful. I mean, they have been kind of skillful in terms of messaging to the Arab world.
Jon Alterman: But as you pointed out, they’re not really getting large numbers of people in the street. They're not affecting public policy.
Hussein Ibish: Correct. The biggest thing is that it was a complete shot in the dark, but they were hoping that October 7th would spark a regional war against Israel. That Hezbollah, ran, al-Hashd al-Shaabi groups, and Houthis would all run to their defense, as they thought they had been promised, or as they hoped they had been promised in Beirut last summer. That didn't happen. That's the biggest letdown for them. What they would be looking for is unrest in these countries pushing those groups and societies toward more conflict. However, you see the opposite. In Lebanon, you don't see any appetite for war, including among the Shi’ites of southern Lebanon. There's just nobody pushing for Hezbollah to have a war with Israel under current circumstances. Not at all.
Jon Alterman: I've known you for about 15 years, maybe a little more. I know your thinking on Palestine has evolved a lot over that period of time. Where do you see the Palestine issue going over the next 5 to 10 years? I'm not saying a single scenario but give me a sense for what you think some different scenarios might be.
Hussein Ibish: I think there are only two likely scenarios, maybe three. The first is the main one. I have been saying since the failure of the Camp David Summit in 2000, and I think it's becoming more and more true with every year, that we have been on a very slow train that's becoming a fast train and could become a bullet train soon, on the way to a station called annexation/expulsion. There is a clear intent on the part of a lot of people in Israel with power to annex big chunks of the West Bank, the Jordan Valley, everything behind the settlement barrier, everywhere there's a major Jewish settlement, and beyond. This has gone from being a fantasy of extremists to being a de facto policy of the current coalition and a plausible scenario.
You can see easily how it would happen. There would be an explosion of violence in the West Bank. It would seem out of control, and the Israelis would say, ""This is too much. We can't take it anymore. We need a divorce. We've got to separate the two peoples—in their interest and ours. This is the last thing we want to do. With a heavy heart, with tears rolling down our cheeks, we will do this thing. We're going to annex this area, and whoops, a lot of people ended up on the other side. Well, they're just going to stay there. This is good for everybody, and we would never have wanted to do this, but we have to.""
I think that's a very likely scenario in the long run because I just don't see how the Israelis square the circle otherwise, and I don't see them as being willing to give up this land, the land that is more important to many Israelis than most of Israel. If you look at this from a religious or even historical irredentist perspective, you’d want the West Bank more than you'd want those areas. Having got it, and having held it for so long, you're just going to give it back because you lost the debate in a moral universe? Because it’s right to do it, or because the UN charter demands it? My fear is the Israeli-Palestinian relationship has degenerated to the point that this is where we are: I think enough Israelis have decided they prefer annexation to any other scenario. There's nothing stopping them. I think that's likely to happen. On the other hand, you could have an epiphany.
Jon Alterman: It's the right neighborhood to have an epiphany.
Hussein Ibish: It certainly is. Well, I'm kind of anti-epiphany. I'm a great agnostic. Anyway, back on planet Earth, there could still be this moment of recognition in Israel that they have two choices. Right now, they could recognize the Palestinian right to a state and, at some point, get into negotiations to eventually create one and end the Gaza war. That would be enough to get a deal with Saudi Arabia and the United States and really consolidate Israel's security.
It would be the beginning of a new relationship with the Palestinians based on propping up the Palestinians who want to talk to Israel rather than the Palestinians who want to kill Israelis. Or you can just kick back and wait for the war to get worse and worse, which is ultimately what would happen. This annexation/expulsion scenario is so beguiling because it has the appearance of a solution, which it wouldn't be. It would be a catastrophe beyond imagination, but it looks like a potential solution. That's what makes it such a siren song.
The third scenario is that none of that happens, and everything limps along in the status quo. This status quo includes a Whack-A-Mole insurgency and counterinsurgency in Gaza. I can see the potential for Hamas to become the leader of the Palestinian national movement, which would functionally kill it at the international level under current circumstances. I don't think that's terribly likely, but the sort of stumbling along is possible.
In other words, the three scenarios are: you could try to eliminate the Palestinian question altogether through annexation and expulsion, you can build up an alternative to Hamas, or you can continue dealing with Hamas and whoever else in the West Bank and just stumble forward blindly. In Israel, blind is a good word. It's been acting like a giant with a club, waving it around with great smashing capability, but with no vision at all.
Jon Alterman: Hussein Ibish, thank you for joining us on Babel.
Hussein Ibish: Thank you so much, Jon, it's an honor.

Samuel Cestari: Hi, everybody. And thank you for joining the CSIS press briefing previewing the upcoming Quad leaders’ summit, set to take place on September 21st, and the high-level week at the 79th session of the U.N. General Assembly, which will begin Tuesday, September 24th. Today, five CSIS experts will share their expectations and perspectives on key themes in context for these two gatherings.
Just a couple of housekeeping notes before we get started. Each of our speakers will offer several minutes of introductory remarks, after which we’ll turn to your questions. We’ll also be distributing a transcript of today’s call a few hours after its conclusion. The transcript will also be made available on CSIS.org.
So with that, why don’t we go ahead and get started? I’ll turn first to Jon Alterman, CSIS senior vice president, Zbigniew Brzezinski chair in global security and geostrategy, and director of the Middle East Program. Jon, over to you.
Jon B. Alterman: Thank you very much, Sam. The more I talk to people around the world the more I get a sense of profound anxiety about the shape of the U.S. election. I think the perception that President Trump is unpredictable has the effect of freezing adversaries who are uncertain of its actions, but it also freezes allies who have become uncertain of U.S. support. What that does is it prompts allies to hedge against abandonment and to de-emphasize collective action. And these meetings coming up, for many people around the world, are really an inflection point for how they will think about their security concepts in the future.
Will this be one where they will be working in concert with the United States, relying on the United States? Will it be one where the United States will leave them to their own? Or will it be one where they might have the United States? And I think that for each of those outcomes it prompts a different set of other relationships. It affects their entire diplomatic strategy. And there is this moment of watching and waiting.
For most U.S. partners, what they’ve told me is they’re really desperate for a Harris win. They don’t have confidence that Harris will win. They don’t really have a sense for U.S. politics and how they play out. The Electoral College system confuses them to no end. Their hope is that some level of U.S. internationalism, in some variety, returns to being a relative constant in international affairs. To me, that overlooks the fact that Trump’s ideas about internationalism, his skepticism of internationalism, what some have called isolation, have deep roots in U.S. history.
These ideas, shrunk in the face of things like World War II, the Cold War, where you had broad organizing principles for the way the U.S. approached the world that were able to beat these ideas of America first, beat those ideas back. It’s not clear to me, if the internationalists are to win, what that organizing principle would be right now. And to me, I think there’s probably a little bit of overconfidence among European partners and others that if Trump is to lose, then this idea of American isolationism will go away.
I think the other thing to pay attention to with UNGA is, while President Biden will be there, he will be there as a lame duck. I don’t expect either President Trump or Vice President Harris to show – and there’s a way in which the U.N. becomes almost prematurely like a sideshow. It’s not the main event, because the people who are going to decide the future of the way the U.S. engages in the world don’t think being at the U.N., engaging with the U.N., will either help them, and it certainly won’t help them get elected by the American public.
I think two other things are going on at the U.N., particularly with regard to Middle East issues, that are worth paying attention. The first is the new Iranian president who was elected in July, Masoud Pezeshkian, will be there. He will be trying to show a different side to Iran. He will be trying to show that Iranians really want to engage, want to open up, want to reassure the world.
He says that he wants to reengage in nuclear negotiations, diminish the pressure on Iran. The reality is he’s constrained by both sides. He’s constrained by an Iranian leadership, the unelected leadership in Iran, which is very skeptical of Western intentions, which is very skeptical that an agreement will get Iran any permanent benefits, as indeed the JCPOA was reneged upon once the Obama administration left office.
And the people who really call the shots in Iran believe that U.S. hostility is not a variable, it’s a constant, and that the whole issue of the nuclear program is just a way to use other means to weaken Iran. So he has skepticism on that side.
Of course, on the U.S. side, there is so much skepticism in Congress, skepticism in the government. There are such a long list of Iranian acts of malfeasance, which extend from Gaza through the Houthis shelling the Red Sea and into meddling in Iraq and elsewhere. And then there’s the whole issue of human-rights issues, treatment of women in Iran and so forth, that even if Pezeshkian were deeply committed to really changing this relationship, he’s starting from a very difficult point both vis-à-vis the people who really hold power in Iran and vis-à-vis the powers outside in Iran who are growing quite alarmed at Iranian behavior.
So I think we’ll see an effort to really change the music, but I’m not sure how much success he will have, certainly before the next election, even after the U.S. election. I think our – there’s been so much trust that has broken down in the last six years that it’s going to be very hard to get to the place that he talks about wanting to get to.
The final thing I want to talk about is just how much the world is preoccupied with the war in Gaza and frustrated that the U.N. has not been more effective trying to end the war in Gaza. It is really important to remember there’s not a single conflict around the world that has literally billions of people feeling a very deep emotional connection to this conflict on both sides. And the U.N. has really not been able to play a very effective role in terms of reducing the amount of conflict, in terms of improving humanitarian conditions in Gaza, in terms of establishing confidence for what a political framework might look like following the conflict.
In many ways, it’s a reminder that the U.N. system is not very good at resolving conflicts when a member of the – or, permanent member of the U.N. Security Council is deeply involved. It’s partly why the U.N. isn’t very effective on Ukraine. It’s the U.S. relationship with Israel that I think constrains the U.N.’s ability to play the more active role that many members would like the U.N. to play moving this conflict toward a resolution.
But as the world gathers in New York and talks about the role of the U.N., talks about the role of international cooperation, the persistent inability to use U.N. structures to make more of a difference in this conflict, which is very, very much on the minds of billions of people around the world, I think is going to be a sober undertone to the week’s discussions. Thank you very much.
Mr. Cestari: Jon, thank you. Next we have Kathryn Paik, senior fellow with the CSIS Australia chair. Kathryn, over to you.
Kathryn Paik: Thanks, Sam.
Yeah, I’ll talk a bit about the upcoming Quad summit. As has been announced, President Biden will be hosting the three other Quad leaders in Delaware for the fourth annual Quad leaders’ summit this coming Saturday. You know, the fact that the Quad summit meeting is, in and of itself, a very significant event, just the fact that it’s happening. If we look at the tempo of meetings over the past four years, the six leader-level meetings for in-person annual summit every year since 2021, eight foreign ministerial meetings, this is really quite impressive.
The initial proposition for this grouping was that the four major Indo-Pacific maritime democracies could find a way to better coordinate and align efforts in a way that really strengthened the region. So part of the purpose of this summit next weekend will be to try to try to showcase that, in many ways, the Quad has done just that. Additionally, the White House is pushing another theme with this summit, and that’s the enduring nature of the Quad. So I’d expect with all of this in mind, we will see some foot-stomping of past and ongoing initiatives, as well as some new announcements. So I’ll step through each of these points in a little more detail.
Firstly, on the meeting itself, we will have three major world leaders flying across the world for the summit. In Prime Minister Albanese’s case, he did not come to the recent NATO-IP4 summit, which some had questioned. But his government has already come out with a pretty forceful statement on his attendance to the Quad summit. So this is clearly a priority for him and the Australian government.
This year’s summit was supposed to be hosted by India, but due to scheduling difficulties and the availability of timing it was decided to do it instead on the sidelines of UNGA. Also most likely a factor here is now that President Biden is not running for reelection, he could consider hosting this summit here in Delaware as a capstone event for him, a way to see through one of his major foreign policy endeavors. And it should be noted that there was no issue from India on switching dates. As has been announced, they will be hosting next year.
On deliverables, the administration has already forecasted the areas we are likely to see announcements, including health security, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, maritime security, infrastructure, critical and emerging technology, climate, and cybersecurity. Some specific areas I’m watching for: There’s a lot of chatter on health, specifically on cancer and on some version of Biden’s Cancer Moonshot Initiative. During COVID, the Quad demonstrated a strong ability to work together to deliver vaccines across the Indo-Pacific, and health is something that the Quad has always seen as a cornerstone, as a soft power mandate. The Quad will be looking for a serious way to continue to capitalize on the technological expertise of these four countries and coordinate on cancer research and treatment, another major health concern for the region.
On maritime security, I’d expect a mention of the Indo-Pacific Maritime Domain Awareness Initiative, IPMDA, both detailing progress thus far and also how the Quad will build upon the success to continue to empower countries to monitor and protect their exclusive economic zones. We could see mention of further joint cooperation maybe in the South China Sea. And also there’s been some talk about expanding IPMDA a little bit further into the Indian Ocean.
On infrastructure, I’d note that ICT and cable specifically have been a top priority for the Albanese government. Especially in the Pacific, there’s a lot of bilateral and multilateral work already happening in this domain with Australia at the center. So the Quad is likely looking at ways to capitalize on the extent of work going on bilaterally and trilaterally to build upon these efforts, and Australia will likely be pushing hard on that endeavor.
We also might see something on the Quad Fellowship Initiative, which has been expanded to at least two Southeast Asian partners. This fellowship has been an example of Quad efforts to bolster people-to-people ties, another key component of the soft power mantra of the Quad, and there’s a lot of potential to build on here. Currently the United States is the sole destination for fellowship participants, but we could see that expanded to other Quad countries.
Lastly, just in wrapping up, I’d say that it’s important to remember that the Quad itself is – in the U.S. system is one of those rare initiatives that is pretty – has pretty extensive bipartisan support. It’s bridged multiple administrations from both parties. Both former President Trump initially elevated the Quad to the foreign ministerial, and President Biden then raised it to the leader level. Earlier this year, we saw the House passing the Strengthening the Quad Act, and it also has strong support in the Senate and I expect it to pass there as well. So this circles back to one of my first points, which is that from a U.S. perspective the primary purpose of this summit is really to further institutionalize the Quad in the U.S. system and reinforce its enduring nature into the next administration, as well as likely reassure other Quad partners of the enduring nature of the Quad within the U.S. system.
So I’ll leave it there and pass it on to my other colleagues.
Mr. Cestari: Kathryn, thank you.
Next we have Richard Rossow, senior adviser and CSIS chair in U.S.-India policy studies. Rick, over to you.
Richard M. Rossow: Thanks. I’ll pull on one of the threads following up on Kathryn’s comments, which is a deeper dive on India. What does India want to see out of its engagements, since the other members of the Quad are all treaty partners? India kind of stands out in that regard. I’m going to focus a little bit more on the strategic tech angle, which has really been overall, you know, kind of a major focus of the Quad since it’s been a bit shy on moving into overt security cooperation.
You know, first, strategic tech, you know, for India, you’ve got a lot of the same issues that you will probably hear from other Quad members that’s really been sort of driving the idea of convergence of these four countries. They all want to reduce their dependence on China and just generally reduce dependence on any one country on the heels of COVID and some of the supply chain constraints that we saw during that period.
India also has two other critical drivers when it thinks about trying to work with Quad members and companies from the Quad countries to try to improve some of these investments they might attract in strategic technology.
The first is job creation. You know, India, when Modi first came to office 10 years ago, announced this big Make in India program trying to rebalance the economy to have a bit stronger manufacturing component. Ten years ago, manufacturing was about 14 percent of GDP, and Modi set the target about moving to 25 percent of GDP by the year 2025 to provide low- and medium-skilled employment for people that were, hopefully, going to be leaving farms by that point. So job creation’s a big deal for India. I’ll point out that India still is stuck at about 14 percent of GDP from manufacturing. So, so far a lot of the initiatives they’ve tried, including engagement through the Quad, haven’t yielded a lot of fruit.
The second issue is balance of trade. India has a trade deficit that varies between 8 percent and 12 percent of GDP, which puts it about 3 or 4 percent – three or four times larger than the U.S. trade deficit, so not dissimilar to the United States. Of course, we all want to see jobs and balance of trade, but India in terms of sheer numbers and percent of economy has a much steeper hill to climb. So, hopefully, the Quad for India on this point can really attract some of these technology investments that otherwise had been going to China and other markets.
The challenge India faces in this, of course, is that generally countries don’t tend to leapfrog to the top of the list in terms of the robustness and level of sophistication of manufacturing. India wasn’t necessarily competitive even with its own neighbor Bangladesh, for instance, on textile manufacturing, and suddenly hopes that it can be more competitive against Taiwan in semiconductor manufacturing. A lot of the infrastructure and manufacturing level constraints India faces make that leap extremely difficult. But you know, having partners with the United States, with Japan, with Australia – the access to minerals, the access to investors – they are hoping they can do something that would be pretty uncommon in human history, which is moving from, you know, relatively lower on the list of robustness in manufacturing up to the higher end.
I’ll wrap up by just saying that, you know, obviously, the Quad has focused a lot on nonmilitary issues. But the thing that, you know, it doesn’t have military components hanging overhead isn’t exactly true either. You know, it was born out of military cooperation, the navies working together after the 2004 tsunami. They do have an overt working group now in humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, which, of course, a lot of the first responders, when you’ve got a major crisis, tend to be our militaries. They have the Malabar naval exercise, which they say is not Quad, although it happens to involve the same four countries.
And I’d say on security, you know, for the Quad to move beyond technology and health care, if it’s going to go deeper on security, a lot of that depends on China as the pacing threat. You know, the recent attacks on Australian divers, battling India in the mountains of the Himalayas, pressuring U.S. allies like Philippines with some of the resupply missions, you know, if these things start to – continue to escalate, and we think they will, you know, I suppose that that’s probably the pacing threat that’ll force the Quad to start thinking differently about the kinds of things that it’s working on.
So I’ll wrap it up there and let me hand it back over to the other speakers.
Mr. Cestari: Rick, thank you.
I’d like to quickly mention that if you want to ask a question, please press one and then zero. After our next two speakers, we’ll turn to your questions and answer them as best we can.
Our next speaker is Nicholas Szechenyi, senior fellow with the CSIS Japan Chair and deputy director for Asia. Nick, the floor is yours.
Nicholas Szechenyi: Thanks, Sam. And thanks to all for joining us.
I’m just going to comment briefly on the Quad summit from Japan’s perspective. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will be making a trip to Delaware for the Quad summit and then make a brief stop at the UNGA before returning to Japan, because this will be his last trip overseas as prime minister in advance of a leadership election in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
Last month Kishida announced that he would not run for reelection. And that has opened up a very wide-open contest to succeed him. And so I think one of his prime motivations in making this trip is to put a stamp on his legacy in foreign affairs, which is quite profound, with respect to bilateral agenda-setting with the United States, but also networking with likeminded partners such as Australia and India. And this is the first Quad leaders’ summit since he hosted the last meeting in Hiroshima in May of ’23. And I think Japan is sincerely committed to advancing the very comprehensive agenda that Kathryn outlined for you earlier.
And the reason Japan is so attached to the Quad is because it understands that in order to shape the regional environment in the Indo-Pacific and to manage a range of challenges, it has to coordinate more closely with other partners. So the networking dimension to regional strategy, or so-called minilateralism, is really fundamental to Japan’s foreign-policy strategy under what it calls the free and open Indo-Pacific, which is basically a commitment to support stability and future prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and to provide public goods for the developing world. And Japan is very proud of the Quad’s history in that respect.
Also important to point out that, in addition to advancing the Quad agenda, Japan has also been very committed to strengthening bilateral ties with the other three members. Just this summer you saw so-called 2+2 meetings, so meetings of defense and foreign ministers, with the U.S. in July, with India in August, and with Australia just earlier this month; just a range of, first of all, alignment on strategic challenges, but also cooperation across diplomatic and security issues.
I think the common thread for Japan and the common language, or the catch phrase, if you will, that you hear from Japanese leaders and see in their strategic documents is a commitment to preserve a free and open international order based on the rule of law. (Laughs.) That really rolls off the tongue. But fundamentally that’s about establishing rules and norms for the region across a range of issue areas.
I think for Kishida personally, who’s sort of announced an updated version of this free and open Indo-Pacific strategy during his tenure as prime minister, the Quad is really important in signaling a message to the to the developing world that this collection of maritime democracies can provide a compelling package of development support and other initiatives across a range of issue areas that will really benefit, again, the future stability and prosperity of the region. So Kishida, of course, is traveling to Delaware to bid farewell to his colleagues but also to signal Japan’s sustained leadership in the Quad, which will remain a centerpiece of regional strategy for Japan and likely the other partners.
I’ll stop there. Thank you.
Mr. Cestari: Nick, thank you.
After our next speaker, we will turn to your questions. So if you want to ask a question, please press one and then zero to join the queue.
Our next speaker is Gracelin Baskaran, director of the CSIS Project on Critical Mineral Security and senior fellow with the Energy Security and Climate Change Program. Gracelin, over to you.
Gracelin Baskaran: Thanks, Sam.
So one of the things that we’ve been seeing in recent years is a scaling up of Quad collaboration to reduce reliance on China for key minerals required for national, technological, and energy security. In October 2022, Washington announced a plan to launch the $1 billion fund to invest in companies in Quad countries. We’ve seen the Quad Critical and Emerging Technology Working Group. And we’ve seen quite a few bilateral and trilateral agreements. Bilateral between Japan and the United States, the trilateral agreement between India, Japan, and Australia through the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative.
So quickly to run through this, I’ll go through the comparative advantages of the Quad countries and why collaboration is really critical, before going into five areas of strategic cooperation. So the biggest challenge that we have in the United States, it is very difficult to mine. S&P found that it takes an average of nearly 29 years to build a new mine in the U.S., which is the second-longest in the world behind only Zambia, which has really hampered our attempt to boost output of key minerals needed for the energy transition. The permitting process alone can take seven to 10 years, and we’ve seen also an acceleration of litigation in minerals projects given the tension often between mining companies and indigenous communities. So this is where Quad countries play a critical role from a United States perspective, but also for theirs.
So Australia – you know, mining is between 1 and 2 percent of GDP in the U.S. and Canada. But it’s 15 percent of Australia’s GDP. And that’s twice the share of 2018 and three times the share of 2000. And as a massive producer of key minerals, it’s the biggest producer of bauxite, aluminum, rutile, tantalum, Second-biggest producer of uranium, which is important because we committed to tripling nuclear power capacity at COP last year, and lithium. Third-biggest producer iron ore and zinc, and I can kind of go on.
And the biggest challenge that we have is that the vast majority of those minerals are still going to China for processing, which then opens us up for geopolitical disruptions. And Australia is also a critical source of human capital development. It’s not a secret that the world is facing a global shortage in the workforce for mining, but four of the top seven programs in the world for mine engineering are in Australia, and a lot of that talent needs to be exported to meet our needs.
When I look at Japan, I see a comparative advantage with its technological capabilities, efficient processing, and advanced manufacturing, rather than an abundance of critical minerals in and of itself. So almost all of the ore that uses, particularly to manufacture, are coming from other countries. So there’s a few factors with Japan’s comparative advantage. Again, one is expertise in processing and technology. For example, Japan has mineral resources – or, minimal resources of rare earth, but highly efficient in processing and refining. It also excels in smelting and refining commodities like copper, zinc, and aluminum.
Moving on to India, India is actually key for both critical mineral supply and demand. Historically, China has consumed about half of the world’s base metals. However, when you look at a collapsing real estate market, high levels of local government debt, high unemployment, and slowing growth rates, you really see why countries are looking to diversify mineral offtake. China’s economic growth over the last quarter was the worst in five. And the IMF recently noted that China is a significant fiscal risk, and they’re tilted to the downside.
But India has the largest population, rising incomes, positive growth outlook. IMF has called the world’s fastest-growing major economy, and in July upgraded its growth forecast. However, India is highly coal dependent still, and this is why the demand for critical minerals for the clean energy transition is pretty clear. India also has aggressive domestic industrial policy ambitions in defense, technology, and energy, a skilled workforce, and growing technological capabilities.
So kind of turning quickly over to collaboration, one of the primary goals of Quad collaboration is to build that diversified and resilient supply chain, which are the bedrock of national technological and energy security. And what’s evident from kind of the country-by-country analysis that I just presented is that Quad countries have complementary comparative advantages. And particularly, you know, if you want to create the entire supply chain from mine to market, that collaboration is important. And particularly for the U.S. I mean, we’re lagging on production and processing.
So a quick couple areas for collaboration. First is resource sharing and joint exploration. Australia is one of the biggest producers of a variety of minerals – rare earths, lithium, nickel, cobalt. By partnering with Japan, the U.S., and India, Australia actually provides feedstock through long-term agreements, ensuring that these countries have a long-term stable supply for manufacturing. Joint exploration is also critical to develop new sources of critical minerals in underexplored regions. And this is particularly true for potential reserves in India. Fun fact of the day, 99 percent of all exploration fails. So pooling in that capital actually reduces the cost of exploration.
Second, Quad countries can collaborate on research and development and mining, processing, and recycling. Japan and the U.S. actually are advanced in battery technology. Australia has efficient minerals extraction techniques, because of that depth of mining expertise – as I cited earlier, four of those seven top engineering programs are in Australia. And recycling, urban mining, is led by Japan. And India is critical for manufacturing, but also increasing production. Third, these countries can cofinance processing facilities. And these are central to reducing dependence on Chinese-controlled supply chains. Again, Japan has expertise in refining rare earths. The U.S. has investment in advanced recycling technology. And these are critical for building and upgrading these facilities.
Fourth, by developing a strategic mineral stockpile across Quad countries. You know, as China has rolled out restrictions on graphite, gallium, and germanium, and recently, antimony, stockpiling is becoming increasingly important to manage those disruptions. And finally, by sharing those best practices in mining technology, sustainability, environmental standards, it can optimize extraction and minimize ecological impacts through responsible mining.
So in conclusion, you know, what we see is by pooling their respective comparative advantages in extraction, refining, technology, and, importantly also, industrial human capital potential, we really can create those resilient supply chains. And that’s why we’ve seen, I think, particularly over the last two to three years, critical minerals becoming central to Quad engagement. Thanks. Over to you.
Mr. Cestari: Perfect. Thank you, Gracelin. Really appreciate it. And thank you to all of our speakers for sharing your thoughts here today.
So at this point, why don’t we open it up for questions? I’ll turn it over to our operator, Colin, to open up the line. Colin, why don’t we go ahead with our first question?
Operator: And that will be from the line of George Condon. Your line is open.
Q: Great. Thanks much.
I wanted to ask about the importance of this being Biden’s last time at the U.N., and about a war we haven’t talked about today. In his first, in ’21, he announced the end of America first, and championed multilateralism. In his last two years, he said: Don’t get tired on Ukraine. Don’t abandon Ukraine. Do you expect a lot on Ukraine this year from him? Or has the U.N. tired of it and moved past that war, despite his past speeches?
Mr. Alterman: George, this is Jon Alterman. I wanted to take that.
So I worked for Senator Moynihan in the late 1980s, and then-Senator Biden was the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. To me, the Ukraine war touches on everything President Biden feels deep in his bones about the way the United States should operate in the world. It touches on issues of the security of Europe and the importance of the security of Europe to the security of the United States. It touches on necessary deep cooperation between NATO allies and it touches on the potential threats to peace and security of an aggressive Russia.
Again, I think he feels this issue deep in his bones. He’s very proud of the creativity the U.S. has demonstrated, mustering a wide variety of allies through overt and covert methods to support the Ukrainians. He’s proud of the changing role of the CIA and American intelligence agencies in demonstrating what the Russians are doing and undermining Russian plans.
I think when he thinks about his presidency, unifying the world around resisting the Russian invasion of Ukraine is his core legacy. And I cannot imagine it will play a huge role in how he approaches the meetings in New York.
Mr. Cestari: Would anyone else like to take a stab at that one, or should we move on?
All right. I do just want to give one more opportunity for people to join the Q&A queue here. So I just want everyone to know you can press one and then zero to join the queue.
Well, it seems like we covered everything here then. If any questions come up, please do let us know. But this seems to be all the questions for right now.
I want to thank all of our speakers and participants for joining us for this timely call. Please feel free to reach out for anything we can do to help to be a resource, looking ahead to the Quad leaders’ summit and UNGA 79. We’re happy to help, so don’t hesitate to reach out.
As mentioned at the top of the call, we’ll have a transcript distributed to all of you and it’ll be available on CSIS.org.
So with that, I hope everybody has a great rest of your day, and thanks for joining us.

27,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/ai-and-advanced-technologies-fight-combatant-command-and-service-collaboration,Unknown,"September 13, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS event hosted on September 13, 2024. Watch the full video here.
Gregory C. Allen: Good afternoon. I’m Gregory C. Allen, the director of the Wadhwani Center for AI and Advanced Technologies here at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
This afternoon, we’ve got an extraordinary event that gets to the heart of how AI and advanced technologies actually – really, where the rubber meets the road in the Department of Defense. And that is around the collaboration that takes place between combatant commands, which have the operational responsibilities of actually fighting wars, and the services, which have the responsibility of manning, training, and equipping to provide the capabilities that they need, as well as supporting the sustainment of those capabilities.
And in order to have that conversation, we have three of the best possible people you could have across the entire Department of Defense. So to my immediate left, we have Schuyler Moore, who is the chief technology officer of U.S. Central Command, or CENTCOM, which has been an absolute leader in many of these adoption initiatives. Then we have Justin Fanelli, who serves as the chief technology officer of the Department of the Navy, and also the technical director of the Program Executive Office for Digital and Enterprise Services. And then we have Dr. Alex Miller, who is the chief technology officer for the chief of staff of the Army. Thank you so much for all being here today.
Before we launch into the conversation overall, I kind of want to focus on this fact that we have now three chief technology officers. If you were to travel back in time to the Department of Defense in the 1990s, I’m not sure you would find a single individual who had the title of chief technology officer, although perhaps I’m wrong. So it is a relatively new position, although it’s, of course, a familiar one in the commercial technological industry. So I’d like to understand a little bit about what your role is in the organizations, and the fact of the existence of the chief technology officer, what sort of problems are you working on solving? So if we could start with you, Sky.
Schuyler Moore: Absolutely. So I’ve been in the role of CTO for almost exactly two years now. And it was the first role – the first time that CENTCOM has had a CTO. And I’ve shaped it in a particular way, but I think it’s worthwhile noting that CTO roles across different organizations in the department can often take really different forms, because CTO in government tends to mean something that’s a little bit different from industry. Because in industry you’re typically looking at one particular technology and you’re expected to have depth there and execution of dragging that particular technology forward. For us, for each of these individuals, I could list dozens of technologies that we are partnering on, that we are working on efforts to advance. But it means that the role takes a little bit more of an amorphous form depending on what the command needs.
So for CENTCOM, the way that I’ve interpreted it and the way that I execute the CTO role is three parts. Advising the commander, making sure that he has the information to make the best decisions about what types of technologies to bring forward, what technologies to at least start validating and integrating into our experimentation, where investments might need to sit.
I also serve the role of facilitation. There are already a ton of teams doing good work across CENTCOM. It does not need to be that only new efforts are coming out of my office. In many ways, I am best equipped and best positioned to put jetpacks on people who are already doing awesome work. And so facilitation plays a huge role in what I do.
Mr. Allen: And in most cases it’s not an actual jetpack, although we have that technology.
Ms. Moore: Not – without a doubt it’s not, as much as I would love it to be.
Mr. Allen: Yeah.
Ms. Moore: But the last one is pathfinding. So, whether they’re new technologies, whether they’re new processes, different teams that we’re working with, figuring out the early friction points of how to work with those and lifting that burden from the rest of the command is also an important role that we play. And then ultimately transitioning; transition is always the primary goal. I am not the user. My team is not the user. We are always aiming to transition something into an operational-use case and to the user who would own it.
Mr. Allen: Amazing. Let’s get the Navy perspective.
Justin Fanelli: Sure. So within the Department of Navy the CTO reports to the CIO. And so we recently just put out the Information Superiority Vision 2.0. This is how we use data to improve every aspect of operations within the Department of Navy, Navy and Marine Corps.
The tech-director hat is an interesting one. So I’ve shared these hats for about 16 months now; and the CTO role, more strategy, the Program Executive Office, more execution. And so we have a program that we put out about two years ago called Strategy through Execution. And so, to Sky’s point, how can we allow leapfrogs to come ahead faster from an emerging-tech perspective, from a doing-things-differently perspective, and how can we eliminate friction? So from an optimize and from an allow perspective.
A lot of that great work is happening at the edges. We talk to Marines in the field. We talk to Navy fleet users on a regular basis. And if they’re doing something awesome or if they have a sticky problem, we want to use that to amplify what we’re working on, connect dots, find doers, and allow more learning by doing to happen and promulgate into acquisitions that we can get those scaled solutions out soonest and change the way that we’re operating where necessary.
Mr. Allen: Fabulous.
And Dr. Miller, the Army.
Dr. Alex Miller: Thank you.
So, again, I am the chief technology officer for the chief of staff of the Army, General George. And it is an emergent position. And by that I mean the chief said I need somebody who can advocate for our users. And really that’s soldiers. Get out there and make sure that the front of the force has a voice. Identify friction in the process. And I mean the capital-p process for how do we require, how do we acquire, and then how do we provide feedback. And then, third, work across the Army in its entirety.
So generally, technologists are bound to some part of it, whether it’s a lab or part of the acquisition corps, or even in units themselves, but really having somebody who can walk from the chief’s office into the secretariat and go here’s what we’re thinking; I want to make sure that everybody’s involved in the process.
Unfortunately, that is not the norm. So being able to work with my partners at both the secretary and undersecretariat, being able to go directly to our acquisition leads and say here’s what we’re thinking, here’s what we’re seeing, here’s what our servicemembers, either downrange in CENTCOM or otherwise who are decisively engaged, don’t have the time or bandwidth to provide feedback on. So it’s really unfortunately less about the technology itself and more being a facilitator for how we get that technology out there for us.
Mr. Allen: Great. And now, of course, you’re in the CIO organization.
Sky, you were previously the chief strategy officer of Task Force 59 in CENTCOM, which was really about accelerated option of data-driven technologies and AI-driven technologies. And a lot of the stuff that you mentioned was software-enabled as well. So is it fair to say that sort of digital-data, artificial-intelligence initiatives, are really a priority for all three of your roles as chief technology officers? Because I’m thinking about the fact that the undersecretary of defense for research and engineering, the website for that organization is CTO.mil. But if you go there, you’ll find everything from material science to electronic warfare to rocketry, as well as sort of digital technologies.
But in your positions, as you interpret it, is it as broad as that portfolio, or is it really more focused around digital-enabled technologies?
Ms. Moore: Ours is more narrow. And the definition – so our comparison internally is that we have a J-8 that’s focused on resourcing, but also science and technology. And the distinction that we’ve made between our portfolios is that mine is very specifically looking at close-in opportunities, really inside of 12-month execution. If it’s something exceptional, we’ll wait 24 (months). But that 12-month execution to us is an important piece to address for combatant command, because we do have problems that arise inside of what a time horizon of normal engineering development and then acquisition and sustainment can be. So that tends towards the direction of software tools because, in a lot of cases, that is what can be delivered inside of 12 months, but not always.
The example that you gave of 59 is a really good example of hardware, where we have a lot of unmanned surface vessels out at the fleet right now that are being tested or used in operations. And it’s because we identified that there were commercial solutions that could be applied to a problem set we had right now. And that wasn’t a, again, we need to wait five years for it to mature, we need to wait 10 years. Right now, it can solve a problem for us. So that fell into the bucket of near-term opportunity for technology that happened to be hardware flavored.
Mr. Allen: Really interesting. Anything either of you would add?
Mr. Fanelli: Yeah. I would say the nature of the federal government and the nature of DOD has gone more digital. So that’s certainly a focus here.
Mr. Allen: Well, it’s trying. (Laughs.)
Mr. Fanelli: The nature and intention of both are trending in that direction
Mr. Allen: Yes.
Mr. Fanelli: And so we, I think all three of us, long to be and long to connect with folks who are enablers of that, and expediting that. And so, to Sky’s point, I think in generally three horizons. One is from an operations perspective. If there’s anything that needs fixed, this is the activity. This is execution. This is the tyranny of the day. There are always room for improvement there, but sometimes the window of opportunity opens greater than others. And I would say that this is one of those times.
So we have a second horizon for piloting, and then a third horizon to work on some of those external activities or connect with external partners, like R&E, from a material advancement perspective. And, like other critical technologies that probably aren’t ready, we want to be plugged in earlier. We’re taking active steps to make sure that they understand our intentions. And then we’re kind of, like, matriculating that down the field, while we’re sprinting on our piloting activities so that we can get that into horizon one or production as quickly as possible.
Dr. Miller: The Army is a big place and their portfolio is very broad. So, yes, I focus a lot on information technology. And I focus a lot on data-driven technologies. But we’re really focused on UAS, unmanned systems, counter-unmanned systems, electromagnetic warfare, command and control, additive and advanced manufacturing, and working across the breadth of those things. I would love to very much focus on one thing, but we don’t have that luxury. I don’t have that luxury. Therefore, the Army also has things like Army Futures Command, which is look – which are looking at epochs five, ten years down the road.
We also have – I have a great partner, Chris Manning. He is the deputy assistant secretary of the Army for research and technology. And within our acquisition lead, he owns sort of the S&T, the science and technology, portfolio, looking at maybe things that are 10 or 15 years down the road. Fundamental new sciences, application of new sciences to existing and new problems. So I don’t – I don’t go across everything, but the portfolio is much broader than just the ones and zeros, even though most of the things are driven by those ones and zeros.
Mr. Allen: Yeah, that really helpfully clarifies things. Now, you know, the CTO organizations are new, but the problem set of how do you get combatant commands and services to effectively work together, that’s an old problem. And so, before we get into some of the specific initiatives that you all have been collaborating on to sort of make this happen, I want to talk about sort of, like, what is your vision for the relationship between services and combatant commands in these, sort of, you know, new technology-enabled, technology-driven domains? Especially when you’re thinking about rapid time frames.
Dr. Miller, if we keep going with you.
Dr. Miller: Oh yeah. No, that’s a super easy problem. (Laughter.) No, one of the – one of the most interesting things that I saw when I was in Afghanistan, and I think my partners here would share that, is we did things a lot faster deployed. We always did, because the – we were closer to the problem, we could explain the problem much more rapidly, and then people were much more driven to solve and help us because we were – we were in the fight. Our relationship with the COCOMs, I think, is on two different trends.
One, it’s, how do we take the lessons observed in the COCOMs and turn those into lessons learned? And what I mean is, how do you change, whether it is changing your doctrine or changing your formations or changing your technology or just doing a little bit of process innovation, to create some battlefield mischief? The other side is from a command and control – from a how we do war fighting. Our relationships with the COCOMs are changing because fundamentally the way that the COCOMs do business is changing. And I know Sky will talk about some of the awesome work she’s done with Digital Falcon and Digital Falcon Oasis.
But what we are trying to think about as services is, how do we plug into a COCOM commander’s decision-making cycle, and then enable it at the most tactical level, all the way up through General Kurilla’s level, or Admiral Paparo’s level, in terms of they have to make a decision. That decision is going to be either commit or not commit forces on the ground. How do we move that decision all the way down to the soldier, the Marine, the Guardian, the sailor, or the Coastie, or the airman who might be out there, like, to execute that command?
Mr. Allen: Wow. Anything like that? I know you could talk about this topic for quite some time.
Ms. Moore: Yeah. I mean, we’ve really appreciated the partnership that we’ve had with the services because I think that there may be two perspectives that we’re each bringing that uniquely complement one another. And so for us as combatant commands across the board we have two unique features that are really important for tech evaluation and validation, which are real users and realistic environments. If you are not integrating both of those things into your experimentation, you are likely to miss the mark and create capabilities that are not actually creating impact for the users. And so we bring that to the table.
Another way of flipping that on its head and maybe describing it differently from a service perspective is that we can offer very realistic market research for whatever you might be trying to integrate. And so – and we can talk a little bit later about some of the examples that we’ve done with the services that allow them to essentially use us to sharpen the sword of whatever you may be trying to buy in the long term, because it’s everything from does the technology work in the way that it is promised, but also what are the contractual structures and wording that needs to go into place to make this sustainable over time and make sure that it talks to all of the other systems that we have to use as a combatant command. There are really important context clues that we can bring to the services, and in exchange the services can help us articulate our needs in the long run, you know, saying, yes, you are focused on near-term operations, but if you frame this differently or if you help us understand how this gets sustained over a longer term we can each help one another. And I think we’ve gotten much better at that in recent years.
Dr. Miller: Can I – can I –
Mr. Allen: Oh, please.
Dr. Miller: Go ahead.
Mr. Fanelli: Oh, just a quick one on this. We fight joint. We experiment joint. And there have been times in the past where more often than not we deliver waterfall. And it is a known known that agile allows us to learn faster, it allows us to connect and tighten the feedback loop, which results in better product. To me, there are – we fight about definitions of agile. It means together. And –
Mr. Allen: This is the agile project management approach.
Mr. Fanelli: Agile project management, agile for software, and agile in paired working, right? And so where we’re paired with a combatant command and we are closer to a problem – not an email away; shoulder-width away, an experiment away – Sky does an outstanding job of we are one deadline away, and you’re never without a deadline – that expedites the learning by doing for us to accumulate lessons-learned revisions. It allows all of us to learn faster together. We have at times allowed the process to drive us. We now have an opportunity to drive the process by some of these accesses and some of this working together, and that is being rolled back into ways that we acquire and ways that we operate.
Dr. Miller: I love this conversation because the fundamental difference with how we’re trying to do business today versus 10 years ago is we’re doing it live. What I mean by that is Sky said market research and Justin said agile. For us, for the Army, I’ll give two very finite examples.
For CENTCOM, there’s one thing that we all realized in getting deployed that we don’t talk about in labs, we don’t talk about during technical downselects, we don’t talk about during any of the acquisition process: there’s a lot of sand – (laughter) – and there’s a lot of wind, and that sand moves. And when you start having moving components and there’s sand in there, it acts a lot differently than when you’re in a lab. And when you have optics, they don’t react well when light is bouncing off of moisture and sand.
Mr. Allen: Yeah. Just one example that we encountered frequently as a problem when I was in the Department of Defense, that we had a lot of folks who were talking about this problem, is when sand gets in a helicopter engine it’s hot enough to melt that sand into glass.
Dr. Miller: Yes.
Mr. Allen: And then when you turn the engine off, suddenly there’s glass that has accumulated in there.
Dr. Miller: There’s glass.
Mr. Allen: So it’s – you encounter a lot of problems only in the real world, only from the perspective of the operator. There’s also the adversary, of course, you know, who’s not going to hold constant even though that would be convenient.
Dr. Miller: Absolutely. So having that not only market research, but real-world perspective coming back from the COCOM to, you know, our theater armies, the theater fleets, is real.
And another one, it’s not just – it’s not just the weird environmentals that you can see and touch; I’ll give you another finite example from the Pacific. When you put a lot of computers into a human environment and you turn them off, condensation happens. And we don’t plan for these things because it’s really hard to replicate that unless you are in the environment. So not only that market research, but that realistic ability to really get into the fight, into the theater, and that’s – that will lead into what the Army’s doing in transforming and contact. But doing it live pays more dividends than lab-based risk reductions ever will.
Mr. Allen: And you’re going to learn that one way or the other. You’re just going to learn it in the first month instead of the 30th month, or when it is an exercise or a learning activity as opposed to in full operations.
Dr. Miller: So we’re pulling the learning to the left through the connective tissue, through these intersections.
Mr. Allen: That’s amazing. So one of the things that I know is going to be a constant throughout this conversation is integrating the insights that you get from the user, integrating the insights that you get from operating, but then of course the challenge of how do you make that a part of the sustainment process. I’m sure this is going to keep coming up throughout our conversation.
But I know you have a lot of really exciting initiatives that are underway, and I want to give you the chance to talk about what’s going on. Sky, CENTCOM operates in complex, rapidly-changing environments, and you’ve now undertaken a series of exercises – or maybe experiments is sometimes the right word – designed to quickly test and then field the technologies using like AI, and one of these is Digital Falcon Oasis, which I think is mostly about command and control, C2. But tell us what is Digital Falcon Oasis and sort of where you are in the story.
Ms. Moore: Absolutely. So Digital Falcon Oasis is our digital exercise series, and it runs 90 days, and it’s based on a very specific and simple premise, which is the best way to test software tools is to give them to the user and get them feedback as much as – as quickly as humanly possible. And it’s a really interesting and blunt experience for us because, especially I think in the early stages of the experiment, maybe a year-and-a-half, two years ago, we were really just trying to get the muscle memory of how you sprinted and how you communicated between users and engineers, and they were looking at each other like they completely spoke different languages. And so we were trying to do a lot of translation.
But over time, that literacy that that familiarity with the process increased, and it increasing got to the point where they understood the game. So you will roll into an exercise – our next one is going to be in October – and they will sit down. They understand the experience or you’re supposed to bump around with this software tool, figure out where it breaks, figure out where it works, and then you give that feedback. And the most fantastic experience is for us is to sit down at the end of the day with one of these types of exercises and sit with someone in here and “that was the worst software tool I’ve ever used in my life,” and be like, what beautiful, direct feedback. Thank God – to Justin’s point – I’m hearing this now instead of five years down the road when we overinvested and went down a pathway that was not useful.
Flip side is it’s ever more exciting when you are working with a tool that a year ago they gave that feedback and said, “god, I hate this tool so much,” and you’ve iterated, and you’ve worked with them every 90 days since, and they get to a point where they say, “Ah, this saved me a lot of time.” “This helped me do my job.” This made me safer.” And if you can get them to go yes on one of those three questions – Did it save you time? Did it make you safer? Did it make you more effective at your mission? – you have done your job. We are not finished as a technology community until we get that answer from one of the user community. It is not enough to check the box about getting data into one place, or having software tools or a development environment. You are not done until a tool gets into the hand of a user, and they say, “I swear this helped me do my job.”
Dr. Miller: So there’s obviously the problem of, you know, how do you get software to the users, how do you update it quickly enough, but there’s also this sort of operational mission that you are trying to solve a problem for them, that the software is moving the needle on.
So what are sort of the specific tools and capabilities that you are trying to roll out, or trying to develop, or mature, you know, through Digital Falcon Oasis?
Ms. Moore: So we think these days people tend to refer to it as CJADC2 combined joint all-domain command and control, the ultimate DOD Scrabble word. But at the very beginning of this, we chose a very specific and discrete workflow, which was targeting. For us it was something that was very specifically bound, and you could determine who the users were and so go to them and say, what is your normal workflow. You could build a tool around that workflow, and then you could iterate over and over again.
And then the reality of our command is that we are very active, and we had the opportunity to test it live multiple times, run it parallel, run the tools parallel to the traditional process until the user said, no, we’re ready. This tool is ready for prime time, and we were able to transition over.
When you think –
Dr. Miller: Oh, that’s interesting. So with the actual user community –
Ms. Moore: Yes.
Dr. Miller: As the user community is engaged in real operations, you’ve got sort of a subset that running the testing stuff. So this is not necessarily connected to the go-boom stuff, but all the variables in the equation are identical to as it was. So that’s a very high-fidelity test you are running there.
Ms. Moore: That’s exactly right. So early on, again, we were running strikes for the last two years, and you would have your traditional process that is primarily based on PDF, emailing and phone call, and as you can imagine, we just said there’s got to be a better way. If you were to put the data in a common place that is intuitive to the user to be able to get, that is going to result in better outcomes for the command.
And so we were able to sidle that along and break it into distinct parts. We don’t want to even abstract targeting, like you start with a question of there is something that I believe is a point of interest that may pose a threat to us because it’s shooting into the Red Sea. You then move to the stage of target development requires a number of very complex processes and approvals to say, yes, this is a valid target that the department should then be looking at and potentially act on. There is the nomination approval process that then integrates even more organizations that are then looking at that same information. And, again, with every stage of this you’re imagining more organizations geographically dispersed in other locations where they’re going to have to be able to access that data in a timely way. And digital tools, and these types of workflow tools, are what really facilitate it.
So we started with something very narrow, and then it ultimately started leading us to logical follow-on questions of, if I know how to do targeting at speed the next question is do I have the munitions and the supplies in place to be able to do this as well? And so it opened up a whole new workflow about logistics and sustainment. And then it opens up the follow-on question of, for our planning community, once they were thinking about target execution how do they fit into these tools? How do their existing tools fit? And so that really helped us walk our way through what otherwise could have seemed like a boiling the ocean experiment of saying we must build CJADC2 tools. We never started with that vision. We started very specific, and then over time, I think, found ourselves in a place where we realized we’re using them every day.
Mr. Allen: So you’re, like, growing and evolving to CJADC2, as opposed to waterfall defining, you know, CJADC2. That’s really interesting. I also think your experience of, sort of, once you digitize one thing and you like it, you quickly find, well, wouldn’t it be nice if we started digitizing just about everything, so that it can talk to these other systems?
So this obviously brings in the services, who obviously the voice of the user community is critical. But they don’t just want this for a month. They’re going to want this for the next twenty years, which comes up, you know, to questions like sustainment, and also questions like PPBE and the budgeting process for who’s going to pay for this and under what time frame. So how exactly are the Army and the Navy involved in Digital Falcon Oasis and collaborating with CENTCOM?
Dr. Miller: I feel like she’s going to take notes. (Laughter.) OK, so the for –
Mr. Allen: Yeah, Sky’s going to ask for you to discuss the budget live here, and make some real promises. (Laughter.)
Dr. Miller: No problem, as long as there’s a USA Jobs opening somewhere. (Laughter.)
Mr. Fanelli: We said, do it live. (Laughter.)
Dr. Miller: No, so Digital Falcon Oasis, the – so if you just think about CENTCOM, the Army is aligned in a couple of different ways. So we have the Army Service Component Command, Army Central, ARCENT, and then we have a really interesting element called the 513th military intelligence brigade for theater. We have one of those – the MIB(T)s for each theater. But the 513th is CENTCOM’s. And they do all the analytic control and intelligence processing for CENTCOM.
What we tried for, Digital Falcon Oasis one, I think it was, was just making sure that the command and control suite that that General Kurilla uses, and all of his joint directors use within the headquarters, their intelligence apparatus could talk to it and provide that intelligence preparation of the battlefield to CENTCOM headquarters. And then in Digital Falcon Oasis two, what we said is, hey, how do we go downstream from there? So if there is an element that is fighting – and I’ll be a little prideful here, the global response force for America is the 18th Airborne Corps, and the ready for the immediate response force is the 82nd Airborne Division.
Mr. Allen: Those are people who never say no to a hard job.
Dr. Miller: They never say no to anything. So when they come up and they have to deploy somewhere, can they then talk to both their intelligence apparatus and the command and control apparatus from the theater they’re going into – so, like in January of 2020 when we had issues in Iraq and 18th Airborne Corps the 82nd went forward, we couldn’t – it just – it was a hard problem. We saw lots of things going up to that. But now I think I’m confident in saying that the workflows and the threads that Sky talked about, we can say from the division level, from the 82nd, up through their higher headquarters, the corps, and then through the theater service component command, we can now talk. We can say, hey, General Kurilla’s command and control can flow down. That’s one side of it.
The part that we are thinking about now as we move forward into whatever the future looks like is, if you think about Gmail on your computer, and you could only access it through your desktop, it would not be as successful because it wouldn’t scale down. What we’re thinking about is how do you scale it down? How do you scale that command and control from the theater level, so you don’t have a super jock and a nice air-conditioned facility, down to the company commander who is thinking about the next 12 hours, he’s fighting until morning with his boys.
And how do you actually get that C2 all the way down to that element? How do you scale it down? Not up and out, but how do you take that and scale down? So that’s – as we look forward to other exercises, like DFO two, three, four, five, six, and then – again, I’ll be a little bit broader – things like Valiant Shield, and Northern Edge, and Defender Europe, and Northern Strike for the other COCOMs. That is what the Army is thinking about, connecting up to the COCOM and then scale –
Mr. Allen: This is a big series of exercises across all the different COCOMs, yeah.
Dr. Miller: For each theater, yeah. And just being a little parochial, just how do we make sure that we are good teammates to the COCOM so that we aren’t saying, hey, we can’t take your data because we’re broken in some way.
Ms. Moore: But I think – I mean, it’s worth foot stomping, like, the value of that relationship of poking one another in a productive way to figure out where – what is flowing correctly and what is not yet. And so, to the point of we can express a demand signal to the Army and to the Navy, and have at various points, of saying: I need your data. Where is this data? I also need this data on this certain timeline of delivery. And getting that feedback to them that they wouldn’t otherwise know. Why would they know the operational requirement for the timeliness and perhaps the form of the data?
On the flip side, it’s really useful to get feedback from the Army and from the Navy about the way that they need to interact and receive data from us, because it goes in both directions. Everything that we do collectively impacts one another. The data that they are collecting, whether it is for personnel, for logistics, equipment or otherwise, impacts the way that we experience them and the ways that we are able to use them.
The flip side, if we can give them data about how we are using them, the impact it may have on sustainment down the road, that makes all of us better, but it involves a lot of back and forth; so very simple proof of life, of I am sending data. Did you receive it? No. Did you receive it now? No. Did you receive it now? Yes. And just doing that over and over again. And having multiple opportunities every 90 days to try it is very helpful.
Mr. Fanelli: On that reps piece, one of the main parts here, a differentiator, is that the COMs are going horizontal. And so this is the Army talking to CENTCOM. This is the Navy talking to CENTCOM and back and forth. What often happens, it’ll have to go all the way up to the satellite and back down, and that’s slow transmission rate. And so both the COMs, the learning, the feedback, good or bad, is happening side to side.
And so there were cases where we are providing data feeds. And we have a superior data feed, but it’s on the way and it’s nine months away. What can we do about that? Can we pull something forward? We have a series of Horizon 2 pilots. We are prioritizing those based on, hey, not only what might be ready, but what might have the biggest effects. And we are now informed by what’s going on there. And then largely listening and observing, hey, how can this change the way that we work in other theaters. How does this support our activities within INDOPACOM?
So there’s a lot of parallel collateral learning that’s happening that applies both to our execution in other domains and within acquisition to say, oh, that thing that we’re buying or that thing that we’re sustaining, no one’s using that now.
Mr. Allen: Wow, which is probably hard news to hear, right, if you’re in the – (laughs) – program office and in charge of delivering that.
Did you want to say something, Dr. Miller?
Dr. Miller: I do. I love this, because we are three CTOs. And I’ve had very exquisite conversations with Sky about how different AI models work, down to bits and bytes. And I’ve had very exquisite conversation with Justin about communications capabilities. And the fact that we’re not talking about that is probably a proof that we’re doing the right thing, because we’re talking about very simple things. Like Sky said, we’re getting reps on how do we share data. We’re getting reps on how do you share laterally.
And I just want to put a fine point, because what Justin said is 100 percent correct. If two commiserate elements in the different services – so if I pack an Army division and a destroyer and they’re peer echelons, they don’t talk to each other. They talk through someone else, probably at the four-star level. They have to go up to the fleet. They have to go up to the corps. And there’s some level of interchange.
Something we’re trying to work through now is just what should it look like in terms of me being able to talk directly across and down to their elements without having to do that very weird –
Mr. Allen: Without asking your boss to ask his boss –
Dr. Miller: – Cold War hierarchy. Yeah.
Mr. Allen: – for permission to talk to his subordinate. Yes. That’s a broken system. You can’t – you can’t be joint if that’s the way that you’re allowed to talk to each other.
Dr. Miller: That’s exactly it.
Mr. Allen: Now, I want to talk about what success looks like in this series of exercises. So, you know, you talked about moving from a world in which data is shared by emailing PDFs to a world in which, you know, you actually have real-time data sets that are either streaming or API-accessible or whatever it may be.
And what metrics are you looking at when you say, like, have we made it yet? And what’s your sort of, like, long-term theory of success for this series of exercises?
Ms. Moore: The short version is we try to keep it bite-size, because, again, I think that there is risk sometimes of trying to express what success is in terms of standards, where everything will perform in X-Y-Z ways, that ultimately is generally interesting to everyone and specifically useful to no one. And so we really try to, again, keep it specific of there is this workflow and there is a user that is our guide on whether or not that is successfully –
Mr. Allen: And this is your 90-day sprint cycle, right, that – yeah.
Ms. Moore: That’s exactly right. That slowly balloons out so it does start to touch more and more elements at the command. I think, again, when we first started two years ago it was primarily our J3 which is responsible for operations and our joint fires elements specifically that was looking at targeting. But over time, we now have almost every single joint directorate and component involved in these digital exercises every single month. In many cases, they’re actually running their own inside of 90 days because they said: You’re not moving fast enough; we have some other things that we’d like to add in. And so in many ways that process alone means success, that it’s building – getting into the muscle memory, into the bones of the organization, that it thinks in sprints.
But success has to be measured in a very simple and very tactical sense in many ways, which I think is sometimes difficult because we want to have these broad winds of CJADC2 has been executed. But the reality for us it that it’s really small anecdotes like a targeteer who says this used to take me four hours and 50 people to pass the data from this network to the last, and now I can do it with the click of one button. And the relief on their face is the win. Like, that is what qualifies as a win. And again, it feels like this small moment, but then what we can do to make sure that we are getting that win and also sharing it with the rest of the department is by making sure that we are integrating with the Army – with the Army and the Navy and the Air Force and the other services, that we’re participating in larger exercises like the Global Information Dominance – I mean, the CDAO runs, because they can then pass those lessons out to other combatant commands. It may be, not be exactly the same solution in every combatant commands, but in a lot of cases at least the process to find it will somewhat rhyme.
Mr. Fanelli: To that point, when we couch or frame wins in terms of outcomes, it travels faster. It carries better. And so we’re prioritizing based on what we’re seeing here and working together on: We do a lot of activities; are they moving the needle? Turns out most things are parade-o, right? Twenty percent or less is really moving the needle. And so we have a better sense now than we did before, based on how we’re measuring, on this activity that we think is really important; is it moving mission outcomes or not? And so organizing around that specifically on the acquisition side I believe is giving us an opportunity to both be more evolutionary in a meaningful way, but then also revolutionary when an outside idea or an emerging technology storms on the scene.
Some of the features within artificial intelligence that potentially streamline, automate, or even eradicate a need for a(n) existing function, that type of disruption is something that we haven’t always been equipped to take into consideration, and now we can prioritize based on that. And that’s just helping us work and partner together because we have the so-what built in. Not everyone’s good at translation. And so where we can institutionalize this translation piece, then it applies to more pockets faster.
Mr. Allen: Amazing.
So I want to now shift from Digital Falcon Oasis, one series of important exercises, to Desert Guardian. So I think anybody who’s looking at what’s going on in the war in Ukraine, anybody who’s familiar with in the CENTCOM region the missile and one-way drone strike that Iran launched on Israel understands that this problem of defending your skies against UAS systems is a permanent feature of warfare at this point. So what is Desert Guardian trying to do to move the needle on this problem?
Ms. Moore: So we’re really excited about this series in part because of a very specific problem that, as you mentioned, impacts our command significantly; but also, because to us it’s an example of success of partnering with a bunch of different organizations that hold slightly different perspectives on the same problem. For us right now, the most critical point is to improve the capabilities that we have today, right now, to be able to protect our servicemembers and partner nations who are forward. But additionally, it also –
Mr. Allen: And this is – this is – I mean, the capability that is being worked upon here, is it a missile defense system? Is it a(n) early warning system? You know –
Ms. Moore: So I think it might be helpful to take a big step back –
Mr. Allen: Please.
Ms. Moore: – from counter-UAS and just sort of look at the whole scope of the problem because I think sometimes we think about counter-UAS only in terms of the very last section, which is shooting it down. And that is really important piece, certainly; you want to make sure that you have a range of shooters to reach for that could potentially defeat something. But there is all this other lifecycle in front of it where you have opportunities to improve your ability to protect your forces. So everything from sensors and increasing the types, the diversity, the spread of them in order to be able to find things further out, but not just find air tracks further out but identify is it hostile or not.
You can imagine a space – imagine D.C. and what the airspace here looks like. Massive amounts of clutter, whether it is balloons, trash bags, commercial air coming out of DCA, everything that you could imagine. And so being able to sift through all that clutter and fairly quickly say, there is something that is coming in at bearing and speed that appears anomalous. We’ve really got to be able to narrow in on that specifically and defeat it quickly, means that there’s a little bit of sensing, there’s a little bit of correlation and characterization, so software that sits on top of that.
But the really important piece that we thought Desert Guardian really needed to address was the point of integration. So what we mean by that is that, you know, you can throw as many shooters as you want at a team, you can give them as many sensors, but the feedback that we have consistently gotten from our users is that we are actually making the problem worse if we keep giving them more screens. What they meant by –
Mr. Allen: I think that’s worth just saying again. You are making their life worse if you just keep giving them more screens. And in, you know, a historical operations center, it’s totally routine for one program of record-delivered system to result in one screen. And so you might have an operation center that is just, like, and this thing talks to AFATDs, and this thing talks to Patriot, and this thing talks to –
Dr. Miller: There are – there are Navy systems too. (Laughter.)
Mr. Allen: And, you know, that can make life hard for the folks who are in charge of understanding what is happening across all these sort of different data streams. So I just wanted to sort of complain about the way, you know, things can look when they go wrong. Please continue.
Ms. Moore: To be clear, all of the services share this problem, in a beautiful –
Mr. Allen: They really like screens. (Laughter.)
Ms. Moore: Right, exactly.
Mr. Fanelli: More sharing. More sharing. (Laughter.)
Ms. Moore: But, I mean, you can imagine – imagine a space, quite literally, you know, a base defense operations center can, at times, be around the space that we’re sitting in right now. And every couple of feet, you’ve got a different screen that is displaying information from a different sensor, or is the screen from which you are able to shoot something.
Mr. Allen: Looks like a 1980s video arcade, right?
Ms. Moore: It does, but with the fun added benefit of having just a handful of minutes to respond when something is coming towards you, and so you have to run between the different screens or have people shouting – literally shouting – to one another what they’re seeing on their screens, to be able to have one person contextualize and then make decisions about what to do. And if you have that, again, you can imagine what stress a user feels when they say, you think you’re helping me by giving me this excellent, amazing new sensor or shooter, but you are actually in tactical terms making my life worse.
Mr. Allen: So this gets to your point about integration really being a key goal of this series of exercises.
Ms. Moore: Without question. And so the way that we’ve structured the exercise is that we will be bringing in new sensors. We’re going to start with sensor integration. And say, you’re being tested on your ability to detect UAS, but the actual primary metric that you’re being tested on is whether you can pass data to a screen that is not yours. That is whether or not you are successful. Prove to us two things: Sensors, you need to prove to us that you can explain how you send your data, that you can do it, that you can explain the message format that it’s going across. And then for the third-party screen, you have to be a good arbiter and you have to have well-documented application programming interfaces or APIs. You have to communicate as well.
Mr. Allen: Yeah. So this – I mean, I think for some folks who are watching, they’re going to think this is useless, geek speak or nerd speak. But I do think this is worth harping on, right? The data structures, the message formats, the application programming interfaces, APIs, you know, this is, like, I don’t know, the internal plumbing of any piece of software system actually working at scale. When you want to go from a bunch of people in a room shouting at what they’re looking on a screen to, you know, it’s handling millions of messages per minute, you know, if needed, between a bunch of different systems.
And so the fact that you’re actually requiring contractors, we want you to come work with us. We’re excited about your fancy sensor. But your ticket to the show – (laughs) – is that you have great documentation that tells other people how to work with you, I think is a really exciting, you know, paradigm.
Ms. Moore: And then, I mean, when it pivots then to the services and the other organizations – we’re also partnered with CDAO and very aggressively with the Army on this – is that that documentation is not CENTCOM-specific. It may absolutely be that you need different sensors and you need different shooters depending on the threat that you face, depending on the theater that you are in. But the requirement to have them send data to one another is not unique to CENTCOM. And if we can offer a playbook that others can pick up and say, this is how you write your contracts, this is the – these are the questions that you ask your vendors to force them all to play ball, to be able to get all of your screens to look a way that helps a user execute their mission, that is where we can all benefit.
And it’s been fantastic partnering with the Army because they really have viewed this, again, as that realistic in-contact market research, of we’re going to run Desert Guardians side by side with them and share whatever lessons learned we have. We’ll go back and forth with the difference between contracts, and how contracts have been worded before and after, where this might be able to evolve, to maximize flexibility going forward. We’re not going to come out of this pretending we know exactly the sensors or shooters or interfaces that you need. But we do need to have documentation down.
Mr. Allen: So, you know, when I hear Sky talking about something that is learned in one combatant command that is quickly transmitted to all combat commands, my immediate assumption is it’s a hoax. So I’d love to hear from the services, is this really working? I mean, are you finding that you’re able to take the lessons from Desert Guardian in contracting standards and data standards? Is it really flowing back to other programs of record, other combatant commands? Please.
Ms. Moore: I’ll stand in a corner, so you guys can – (laughter) –
Mr. Allen: Yeah, get earmuffs.
Dr. Miller: Before I answer your question, I did not appreciate this until I left the Intelligence Corps and came and started working for the chief, and sort of diversified my horizons. The reality is, several times when I was in Afghanistan you would hear, brr, and that was the C-RAM going off. And then you would hear a pop. And then about two seconds later you’d hear: incoming, incoming, incoming. (Laughter.)
Mr. Allen: As in, it’s already been shot at. It’s already blown up. And now we need to tell you about it.
Dr. Miller: Yeah. The reality of time cannot be overstated here. So Sky mentioned, and I just want to double down on it, you’re talking about things, and I mean more than one, traveling at 100 knots that are coming directly at you, at altitudes that are very low, very hard to see. It’s not like you can point at the sky. The enemy is using terrain to its advantage, buildings to their advantage, the civilian population to their advantage. And that cannot be overstated.
The second one is, I just want to give a shoutout. Our air defense artillery soldiers are – they’re superheroes. The dwell time for our fourteen series, our ADA soldiers, is incredibly low. Dwell time means normally you would have a year deployed and then you have a year at home, a one to one. They’re doing a year abroad and then six to seven months at home before deploying again. So they are superheroes.
Mr. Allen: And that’s just because they’re so in demand right now.
Dr. Miller: Because they’re so in demand. And the third piece is the data. Normally when we think about data, we think about really well-structured – like a tweet. A tweet has a really well-structured header, and the body, and the timestamps, and everything. When we talk about –
Mr. Allen: And that’s about – I mean, just for folks who aren’t, you know, used to thinking in these terms. That’s why you can query the Twitter database of 100 billion messages, because those data structures are extremely well defined, extremely documented, and you can talk to the machine at scale. And what we have is emailed PDFs. And we’re lucky in the DOD if we can use the same memo template. But I – yeah, sorry. Continue. I’ll stop. (Laughter.)
Dr. Miller: And then – but then when you get to, like – no, that’s perfect. But when you get into sort of sophisticated sensors, when you talk about radar data, you’re talking about Doppler shift, time, range, vector, speed. Those things, and then all the –
Mr. Allen: Those are tough physics problems.
Dr. Miller: They are. And then they’re codified in a string of hexadecimal, so not even binary, that has to be translated. And that’s if we get the raw data from the sensor, because proprietary data feeds are a problem. We have locked ourselves in in really bad ways.
Mr. Allen: So this is, like, one company, they’ve solved, you know, the physics problems we were just talking about. They’ve got a data structure for how to interpret that information. And, no, you’re not allowed to know how it works or how to talk to it, if you’re some other company.
Dr. Miller: Exactly. It’s a black box. So what Desert Guardian is helping us with – and I’ll talk about how it translates in a second – is, one, bringing all those vendors back to the table and going, hey, the way of the world is changing, we are not going to do one-for-one sensor to decider to effector. We just aren’t. We need many sensors to many deciders, which you might whittle down to many effectors. And that could be a kinetic effect, or something that blows up. That could be a non-kinetic effector, something that fries a circuitry – whether it’s directed energy or electromagnetic warfare.
But that many to many to many relationship is the key here, which means we go back and we say, no longer – if you don’t want to share your data interfaces, if you don’t want to share your documentation, that’s fine. Thank you for your interest in national security. There’s the door. And we have to be very stringent about that. That’s the left side. The right side is we also are going to take the lessons learned from this and help us write better escape clauses for contracts. So if a vendor stops being a good partner, we stop being their partner.
And I don’t want to sound calcified against industry. Industry –
Mr. Allen: Because we’re trying to bring in industry. There’s all this stuff going on, yeah.
Dr. Miller: We are. And the organic industrial base doesn’t win wars. The organic and defense industrial base wins wars. So it’s not an us versus them conversation. It’s, hey, we want to be a better partner. We would like you to be good partners as well. How do we get there?
In terms of transition, another shoutout. PEO Missiles and Space are doing phenomenal jobs. They own all of the integrated air and missile – integrated air and missile defense system. So everything from your Avenger, which is a Humvee with four rocket pods on it, to the direct energy short range air and missile defense, to all the Coyote missiles which are saving lives in Iraq and CENTCOM, they own that. And they are working on: How do you – how do they recompete in a meaningful way the command-and control systems for that? How do they make sure that sensor integration, and I – works and happens? And I do believe and I can say I know that they’re going to take the lessons learned from Desert Guardian and integrate that back into the Army so that we are a learning organization.
Mr. Allen: So, you know, you’ve got this urgent problem, which is, you know, one-way UASes and sort of the broader problem of how you protect your skies. And when you have an urgent problem, you can get some rapid money to kind of address that problem. And what I – what I really like about what I’m hearing –
Dr. Miller: Can happen? (Laughter.)
Mr. Allen: Oh, maybe you can’t get money. (Laughter.) I was just going to say, you know, what you’re sort of telling industry is: Hey, what we really want is systems that talk to each other. So if you want access to the rapid money, the price of admission is an open architecture that we can work with and that other folks can work with.
Mr. Fanelli: And we actually are able to now make that more of a funnel than a back and forth, right?
Mr. Allen: What do you mean by that?
Mr. Fanelli: So what I mean by that is we are more open, based on the lessons learned – my favorite way to learn lessons is through teammates and others, right? We don’t have to learn them all for ourselves; the idea of a top-level requirement or opening the aperture in an open-minded way to what are the different ways that we can solve this problem. We are doing more top-level requirements. So OPNAV N2/N6, based on learning that’s happening in a number of different places, has said instead of the 300-page requirements document that narrows the competition down, it’s 10 pages and it allows more competitors to come in and say, hey, we think we can solve this but it’s different from how we’ve always solved it, or it’s different from how you’re thinking about the problem. Well, that might change the tactics, techniques, and procedures. That’s OK. We can work through tech-informed concept of employment to do things differently.
And so to the point of this conversation, if you go from the decision backwards and learn from what’s happening, the integration is going to happen no matter what; it’s just either the wetware or the software underneath. And so something that’s commendable through these activities is they’re always panning out to say, hey, we’re going to solve a problem locally, but is there a way to abstract this and make this reusable on a regular basis. And so what we’ve taken from that is we’ve said there are designated enterprise services that just solve from a modular perspective a problem for multiple groups; let’s designate that.
And so we have recently within Department of the Navy learned from what’s happening to say we need more designated enterprise services – naval identity services that connects jointly, the idea of using Jupiter and Advana for many more analytics and business intelligence cases so that we can share data through that federated feed. That opens it up. There are, as a result, more collisions, more opportunities that populate from that based on what they’re learning that we can roll back into our acquisition and strategy decisions.
Mr. Allen: Yeah. And I mean, you mentioned the difference between a 10-page – a 10-page contract document versus a 300-page contract document. But now, you know, when you – when you do have requirements, it’s a minimal set of requirements, it’s sort of the right set of requirements, and they’re focused on interoperability standards, if I understand you all correctly.
Anything else anybody wants to say about Desert Guardian? Because we got one more that I want to get to. OK.
So let’s talk now about Desert Sentry. Sky, what is Desert Sentry?
Ms. Moore: You’re probably hearing a theme in the naming conventions, which means that we are –
Mr. Allen: Something to do with desert, something to do with dry places.
Mr. Fanelli: Maritime –
Ms. Moore: Yes. (Laughter.) We’re 50 percent agreed we’re just sticking to one of the words.
So Desert Sentry is our AI experimentation. So as a command, we try to be mindful about where and how we engage with AI because, again, it –
Mr. Allen: It’s easy to – I mean, I say this as the director of the Wadhwani AI Center – (laughs) – it’s easy to decide that you want to use AI before you’ve even asked the question is AI a good fit for my problem.
Ms. Moore: That is precisely what I was getting at.
Mr. Fanelli: Yes.
Dr. Miller: Yes.
Mr. Allen: Yes.
Ms. Moore: That is exactly what it was, which is that just because you can doesn’t mean you should with AI.
Mr. Allen: Right, yeah. If you can solve a problem with, you know, hammer, it doesn’t – you don’t need to make it an AI hammer, right? (Laughter.)
Ms. Moore: That is exactly right.
Dr. Miller: Probably could find one of those. (Laughter.)
Mr. Allen: I bet you somebody would sell us one, yeah.
Ms. Moore: It definitely – without question a company –
Mr. Fanelli: Don’t check (his house ?).
Mr. Allen: This is my – this is my new Kickstarter. (Laughter.)
OK. Sorry. Sky, please.
Ms. Moore: Valid. They –
Mr. Allen: Back to your AI initiative.
Ms. Moore: Trying to be really specific about the AI use cases that are appropriate for a combatant command. And so the areas where we have started to carve out, the most obvious one is computer vision, where that’s existed for decades. We’ve always had a general sense that we are collecting so much imagery there has to be a better and more efficient way of sifting through it.
The challenge that we have felt as a combatant command is the distance between model development and user workflows and the realities of how we have to operate day to day. So what I mean by that is that if a model is running but it only gets updated, say, twice a year, or if it’s running but you can’t tell the modeling team I actually need to look for something different – the enemy changed their tactics, techniques and procedures, they’ve started covering things in tarps, they’ve started using different types of vehicles –
Mr. Allen: Yeah. I mean, this is something that my colleague, Kate Bondar, who’s really focused on AI and autonomy in the war in Ukraine, you know, she basically says if those models aren’t changing every week, well, Russian tactics are changing every week. And so if you can’t really get into that kind of update cycle, it’s just not going to work. And that’s not necessarily a problem that, you know, autonomous car drivers do. Stop signs are red this week. They’re going to be red next week, right. But maybe what the adversary is up to in a warfighting domain is not.
So your point about the need for rapid iteration and tightening the relationship between model development and updating and user workflows, I think it’s right. And if you had asked me three years ago, you know, should the combatant command be directly involved in model updates, I would have been like, what do you mean? Combatant commands don’t do technology. But now, I mean, you’ve completely persuaded me.
So please continue.
Ms. Moore: Well, first of all, I’m very glad.
Mr. Allen: Yeah. (Laughs.)
Ms. Moore: We – I mean, I think the important part for us is not that we’re trying to, say, surge model developers to us.
Mr. Allen: Yeah.
Ms. Moore: We’re not saying that we need to have our own internal AI development team. What we need is for users to better be able to engage with the models that exist out there. So that means that they need to be able to label new data sets that they think are relevant to them. They need to be able to push those label data sets to then retrain a model to look for something different.
Again, the sort of classic unclassified example that exists is like a picture of a plane from the top, and you’re looking for a plane, and then if you put tires on top of the wings, all of a sudden a lot of computer-vision models have difficulty identifying that that’s a plane. If you were able, in that single moment, for a user to say I identify that the adversary has changed what they are doing visually, I am going to go back and start labeling to at least adjust for maybe I’m looking for a different type of plane shape or I’m looking for a nuance that accounts for a change in coloration on top of the wings. That may be able to get me there.
But if it takes you six months to get to that answer, and then the next day they say, oh, perfect, you didn’t like tires? OK, I’ll put something else on top. And it breaks the models right again. We’re spending inordinate amounts of time on computer vision with very little to gain.
So low-code, no-code models is really what we’re interested in. And what we’re doing is running a competition with different vendors who are supplying low-code, no-code computer-vision models. We got about 100 folks that submitted to us through CDAO’s commercial-solutions offering. Again, we are so grateful for the partnership of so many of these great organizations. None of what we do is alone. We then down-selected down to five, and those five are going to give containerized models over to five user groups at CENTCOM next month. And they are not going to be allowed to speak to them after that, because the users are going to be grading them on usability.
You’re also going to be graded on whether – it’s a similar construct in counter-UAS in many ways. We’re interested in whether you can detect UAS. We’re interested in whether your model can detect. But more importantly, we’re focused on the user experience, because, as a command, that is what makes or breaks it. And so we’re really looking forward to the exercise series next month where they’ll be able to work with these models, and we’re going to see. The hypothesis is that users could really take a more substantive role in shaping and iterating on models. Maybe we’re wrong. But the only way to know is to try.
Mr. Allen: So I want to highlight what is not quite making sense in what you just said, because, you know, for a lot of this conversation we’ve been talking about the need to tighten the loop of communication between the folks developing technology and the folks who are operationally using the given technology. But here you just talked about cutting off communication between the model developer and the user community. So can you sort of elaborate, like, why you do it one way this time, why you do it that way another time?
Ms. Moore: A hundred percent, because I appreciate the distinction. And it’s important to foot-stomp that when you are testing something for a user experience, we are trying to set the – that is a different test than testing whether a tool works in not being a primary. So when the primary test is I want to see if this targeting-software application helps our users move faster, it is useful to have the engineers side-saddled with them to work on the development of it.
However, when the one test that we’re looking for is could a user who is forward, who doesn’t have access to an engineering team, use your tool and feel their way through it and be able to use it, that requires a different context for the experimentation. That means that a vendor will be separate for that period.
That said, we are a hundred percent then going to have after-action reports where they go back to the user and say what was that experience like? And they will get an abundance of feedback that will then drive iteration for their technologies and also the way that we execute our experiments. But we’re trying to make sure that we are focused on the right piece of the experiment, so to speak.
There are other experiments that we’ve done with computer vision with all the services as well where the focus has been – the only thing I care about is whether the model is right at the highest degree of percentage. And there, in those cases, absolutely. The modelers are going to be side by side with our users to explain whether they’re using the model right or not. But in this case, the focus is, actually, is it possible for a user to be able to do this without having the training wheels of an engineer side by side? Slightly different construct.
Mr. Allen: I see. Makes sense.
Dr. Miller: And I want to jump on that. Not because Sky didn’t explain it well, she did, but because this is an area where the Army is also trying to get really far into, because we lack the technical talent, en masse, to support every use case. The notion of self service, where a user can sort of help themselves before they have to go somewhere else, that is the technology that we’re going after. It is not the – it is not the – as Sky said, it is not the specific computer vision model. Like, we can get really finite there and take a long time. It is the ability to say, here is a platform that we have given to you. Can you help yourself before you have to go to someone else? That is the real niche, new use case that we’re describing.
And the Army stood up its linchpin program. It’s sort of in its nascent stages trying to figure out what is happening next. But I cannot stress enough, the era of putting a field service rep or a field service engineer everywhere all the time for every use case is over. We just, one, can’t afford it. Two, not realistic for large-scale combat, where we haven’t built up fobs. We have a lot of GWOT, global war on terror, hangover, where we forget that all of those bases are big. They are under attack. We are in contact in CENTCOM. But if we think about moving out in Europe, like we’re seeing in Ukraine, if we think about moving out in the Pacific, that is not the case.
Mr. Fanelli: Practicing how we play, or practicing how we execute, has allowed us to get much more laser focused on how we measure. And so, if it is user experience, as Sky laid out, if it’s operational resilience, now we can isolate and say, hey, what did this do to the resilience of the system? When we talk to, hey, how’s the cyber on this? Well, we can be a little bit more secure. What does that do to uptime? What does that do to failover? From an adaptability perspective, what is – based on everything that we done at the abstracted levels below – what is the response time? Are we bringing people on who can allow this to go in three days or three weeks? What does that look like?
And by looking at the externalities of the problem and saying, yep, we know that urgency is up, we know that tech advancements are up, we know that adoption is not where it needs to be. What are the through lines that are the highest prioritization, the highest ratio, that improve the situation? And now we’re making data-driven decisions to allow something to go faster, or really how to prioritize based on those numbers.
Mr. Allen: So recognizing that AI is not the right solution to every problem, you know, we’ve got Desert Sentry, which is actually working on a relevant AI use case and thinking about what is the right way to deploy it. What are you excited about in your role as CTO at the Army, CTO of the Navy, you know, in terms of AI applications? And how are you connecting that to, whether it be Desert Sentry or other combatant commands?
Mr. Fanelli: So what we’re doing is we’re running two things, a series of structured pilots and a series of structured challenges. So I’ll talk about the pilots first. In this particular case there are some places where for every pilot we require three different leads, the pilot lead to run it, the operational lead and champion to make sure that this day by day is a validated use case and we’re taking in all the contextual information, and then a transition portfolio.
Mr. Allen: These are all Navy –
Mr. Fanelli: These are all Department of the Navy, yeah.
Mr. Allen: Yeah. OK, Department of the Navy.
Mr. Fanelli: So – but at different locations, in different situations, yeah. So the receiver – so the portfolio or program office lead is there pulling the solution into acquisition. So across those three, they are coordinating to ensure, from a use case perspective, that we get those across.
So we have a few dozen AI pilots, structured pilots, that we’re pulling through. Some of those are tech driven. Some of those are use case driven. All of those are validated. And so we have those in our horizon three and horizon two. The point is, this is a garden as opposed to building a building. And so if either the maturity of one of those solutions comes forward or the need pulls it forward, then we can fast forward on some of those.
Mr. Allen: Can you help me understand, like, a little bit how big these pilots are? Is this, like, $100 billion or like 30 bucks, somewhere in between?
Mr. Fanelli: Closer to the latter. (Laughter.)
Ms. Moore: Thirty-five.
Mr. Fanelli: Yeah, yeah. (Laughs.) Most of the pilots are scoped for three months’ worth of work. We’re talking generally about commercial off the shelf solutions and something on top of that. So what we’ll do is we’ll take a validated use case and product and then pull it through. So particular examples, potentially on the less sexy side, are no one enjoys help desk. We have many of those where we have streamlined towards Amelia AI, and then scaled that. That has made it from –
Mr. Allen: What’s Amelia AI, for those who are not familiar?
Mr. Fanelli: Yeah. This is a help desk tool that does more LLM-type functions, that reduces wait time, that reduces time to solution. So this is abstracting some of the pain that is customer service. On the back end –
Mr. Allen: And I think it sort of highlights how you kind of have that enterprise-facing role. You’re, on the one hand, very close to touching some war fighter applications with your collaboration with CENTCOM and elsewhere, but you’re also, you know, part of the CIO organization and are familiar with those types of challenges, and where technology can move the needle.
Mr. Fanelli: Anywhere that we can remove friction. And so this is, like, from an abstraction there. And then we have different developer teams who are using multiple ML ops pipelines, or machine learning operations pipelines. And so for this particular case, where we work with the Harbinger team or the Overmatch team, where we can show, hey, here’s how fast we can deliver, or here is the model time, can we connect those different groups? That’s a pilot that has long resulted in a shared service and, I’m hoping, soon an enterprise service.
Mr. Allen: Alex, you want to add anything else?
Dr. Miller: I love this conversation because you said it earlier, and I think we all sort of high fived each other in our minds, AI is not an ends. It is a means. And what we’ve been really deliberate in thinking about is, if you’re going to use AI as a means, it means you’re doing a couple things. That means you are making a decision, which means you have to know what the decision is. You have to know the metrics by which you’re going to make the decision. And sometimes it’s a yes/no, I’m going to do this or I’m not. And then the risk and confidence necessary to make the decision. And that is all generally commander’s risk to make or take.
So we’ve been – we’ve been – I hate to – I hate to say we’ve been doing AI, because that’s not what we’re trying to do. What we were trying to do is make as many people’s lives easier as we can. And a couple examples. Within the headquarters, we have this thing called the ETMS2. I can’t remember where it stands for. It used to be the task management tool. But it’s a most bureaucratic system ever made.
Mr. Allen: So this is task management as the tasker, the system?
Dr. Miller: The task – yes.
Mr. Allen: Yeah, OK.
Dr. Miller: But, if you open it up, there’s a bunch of things you have to read. And there’s lots of documents. And there’s summaries of those documents that some staff action officer has to type up. We’re going to start applying LLM to that. Very simple use case specific to that technology. So we’re not trying to make LLMs do things that LLMs weren’t made to do, just to summarize, hey, here’s what’s in those documents. Save staff time.
Mr. Allen: Now, I’m a little bit skeptical here. And the reason is, you know, large language models are a big, big data set that, historically, you know, is trained on all the open Internet. And then if you want that to touch DOD data, you have to have some kind of cybersecurity authority to operate.
Dr. Miller: Oh, I didn’t say put it on the internet.
Mr. Allen: Fascinating. That was – that was going to be my question. So, like, how is it that both of you have had LLMs actually touch real DOD networks, real DOD data? You know, did you blindfold the ATO officer? What was the approach here?
Dr. Miller: No. So the way that we did it is Leo Garciga, our CIO, he and I have been battle buddies since he was the JIEDDO J6, like, a decade and a half ago. We put it on the network. We put it onto the DOD’s enterprise. And then, through retrieval augmented generation, RAG, you feed it – you feed it the data that you want it to touch, and then it provides some recommendations. So it’s not just, hey, all of wiki. It’s actually, hey, train on those things that gives you context for the language. And then here’s the things we actually want you to leverage against that.
So I talked about the task management. We’re doing a very similar thing. We have this process called the AROC, the Army Requirements Oversight Council. The chief is the AROC chair. He approves requirements. Well, what we don’t do very often is decertify requirements. So since 1979, the Army has generated 1,905 requirements. That’s everything from the M67 frag grenade all the way up through the most sophisticated technologies that you’re seeing going into CENTCOM.
What the chief and General Rainey, the AFC commander, said was, hey, how do we get rid of some of those and give the secretary and the chief decisions based on our resourcing? The easiest way to do that is take all those requirements documents, which are documents, and actually feed them to an LLM so you can start going, hey, what requirements are related here? Again, saving staff action officers’ time. So that’s backend stuff.
On the warfighting side, one of the coolest applications of AI I saw recently, we went down to the Joint Readiness Training Center, JRTC, at Fort Johnson with Second Brigade 101st Airborne. They are part of – they are one of our transform in contact brigades. And they worked with our software factory and Army Artificial Intelligence Center, and built a HLZ/PZ loadout app for TAC. And I said a whole bunch of acronyms, but what that really means is if you’re doing a long-range air assault with helicopters, so you want to know exactly where all the stuff and people on those helicopters are, from the time that they leave to the time that they get to where they’re going.
And right now, that is done in notebooks and Excel. (Laughter.) And I don’t mean, like – I don’t mean, like, Jupyter Notebooks. I mean, like, green field notebooks. Well, wouldn’t it be really cool if you loaded all of those things out, and then you knew exactly where, if you wanted this radio, you go to the pallet because it knew where it was, and automatically load balanced all of the aircraft, all the pallets? It’s not a sexy use case. It saved those troopers time, and I mean lots of time. And it made their lives easier, because then they – their commander said, I need this kit. And they went, it’s on this pallet, on this helicopter. We’re going to get it. Just one of the best – because not only were the soldiers excited to use it – and I mean, visibly lighting up excited – the soldiers who built it were excited to support their peers. It was awesome.
Mr. Allen: That’s a wonderful story.
Mr. Fanelli: And foot stomping, right, like, some of the best use cases of AI are more functional and outcomes-focused than they are sexy, right? We don’t do AI to come talk, like, at a panel, or here, right? (Laughter.)
Mr. Allen: Yeah, what people want, right, is, like, the sort of AI technology that looks like –
Dr. Miller: Skynet.
Mr. Fanelli: Skynet.
Ms. Moore: Skynet. (Laughter.)
Mr. Allen: Well, I was going to say, it looks like a James Bond villain, right? Like, we’re going to have some kind of AI that’s a laser off the moon, and that’ll allow us to, you know.
Mr. Fanelli: And so we’ll talk about that SCIF. (Laughter.) But the idea here is some portion of every person’s day is spent suboptimized. And where we can remove that friction and unleash humans to do human things and perform at a higher level, we want to do that. So to answer your earlier question, like, we have a lot of data. We have exquisite centers that kick off – sensors, that kick off more data than we can handle. So in some of these cases we’re using ML on those. We’re trying to do more edge compute so that we can do that locally and decentralize which aspects that can be decentralized, and then kick others back. We’re doing some really interesting things from, like, a CUI classification, so controlled unclassified information.
Like, no one wants to be a human classifier. If we can do this, we have some RAG applications where here’s the first 80 percent, here’s the Pareto dumb aspects of your brief, or your report. We want to pilot that at larger scale. And then working with the Air Force and the Army on some of the GPT pilots that are, like, secured without external data.
Ms. Moore: I think the, like, common threads across what you guys have described are very much treating AI in a fundamentally different way, where it is not handing you the answer but it is first triage, or it is a cog in a much broader wheel that is handing you a small piece of what ultimately needs to happen. And if we frame it that way for our users, it’ll help us all mitigate against risk because they will understand that they continue to hold a responsibility to check the outputs. Because I worry, again, sometimes, that we say AI is going to arrive and we’re going to hand it to you in a magic box, and it does your job and you can now leave the room. And the reality is that you must – must, not should, must – check the outputs every step of the way.
And so whether it is that first look at a document that someone in the Army is having to look at, whether it is looking at classification and giving that first cut of I think classification might be this, I think that declassification might be this, expressing that to the users and setting their expectations appropriately saves us in an inordinate amount of time down the road if otherwise we might build muscle memory where people say, well, this runs and I don’t have to be involved.
Mr. Fanelli: And that’s huge. I mean, so we talked about responsible AI, the trustworthiness, including over trust, and what it does to outcomes just means that we have better sense of what the outcome is as a result of that human-machine teaming. If we can get smarter at that, and the effects on cognitive load and where we focus our attention is, again, a more data-driven decision, even if that data is feedback from users who are saying, this is a very different – we can do AB testing, we can do side by side. Those loops are quicker.
Mr. Allen: And I love that you’re talking, you know, about productivity improvements, right, giving people back their hours – whether or not that’s the – you know, the use case that’s going to go on the next recruitment commercial because it’s so exciting, or – but, like, what really actually is making members’ lives better.
Sorry, Alex. You were going to say something?
Dr. Miller: The notion of trust is interesting and weird, and it’s weird because lots of people have opinions. I am still the type of person that when I turn on a calculator I hit 2+2= just to make sure it’s still four, because it’s just a – it’s a –
Mr. Allen: It could have changed.
Dr. Miller: Yeah, exactly. But when we talk about trust, we act like we never trust systems ever, and that’s simply not true. What we are trying to do is make sure that we don’t break a user’s fundamental trust in our ability to deliver up front because – and Sky talked about computer vision. Computer vision is hello, world for AI and the Department of Defense. But the first time you give not a not-good answer, a really bad answer to a user, they will never trust that system and that box – potentially, you as a deliverer – ever again. And it’s not because you’re bad at your job or the system’s bad; it’s because they don’t want to spend more time being paranoid double-checking the answers because of one bad experience. So trust is not necessarily about providing a whole bunch of metrics; it’s about that first time or second time or third time that a user gets something and they don’t get crushed by their boss, they don’t have a really bad output, somebody doesn’t lose life or limb because of an output of a system. But I – we started talking about trust, and I just wanted to talk about that a little bit.
Mr. Allen: That’s great.
So I love that we have the three of you here. It’s a real reflection of the collaboration that is, you know, maturing between combatant commands and the services when it comes to the technology part of the story. I just want to, you know, ask, hypothetically, if there was a fourth or a fifth organization at this table, you know, who are your other big collaborators that are helping you, you know, advance the technologies that you’re trying to drive outcomes with?
Ms. Moore: We would be – we have to list CDAO first. The Chief Digital and AI Office has been an exceptional partner from start to finish. They are – they have provided us a drumbeat for our exercises through their Global Information Dominance Experiment. They have provided us opportunities and consulting services, so to speak, about how to think about our own technology integration journey and how we mature as a command. They have provided training opportunities. CDAO has been an exceptional partner.
There are also other services that are not seated at this table that involve themselves in Digital Falcon Oasis. The Marine Corps has been a really awesome partner for us. The Air Force is also heavily involved through our Air Force component. We really are very fortunate across the board.
And then NGA. NGA is so important to mention because, for computer vision, they hold one of the most significant programs in that space, Maven, right now. And they have been excellent partners in feedback with us, because I think when we talk about Desert Sentry there is a use case for that low-code/no-code really quick iterating threat, but there’s also an important use case for more sustained threats where you’re looking for the same thing consistently. And the models that they are providing do that to an exceptional degree, and they have always been really openminded to our feedback of where things could improve, about getting the speed in the way that the users experience their tools differently.
Every partner that I’m describing here and the ones at this table we find valuable when they are openminded to our feedback and treat this as an intellectual partnership. It is neither that they are handing man/train/equip to us and then backing away from it; it is not that we are simply doing our operations in a vacuum; it’s when we have a really constructive dialogue, which I think we’ve built over these exercises, that we all get better.
Mr. Fanelli: And I would say the Defense Innovation Unit and USD(R&E), so Research and Engineering, have allowed us to put more irons in the fire. We needed more shots on goal. Everyone says it’s OK to fail fast on these low-risk opportunities, but if you only take two shots a year you’re a zero. If we have 25, if we have 50 irons in the fire, then we can do portfolio management and pull the best things through.
And so specifically this year, DIU and then USD(R&E) through APFIT and some other programs have allowed us to pull more forward for transition, or to allow us to get over the valley of death. So I’d say those battle buddies are – if we’re good at innovation and we struggle in innovation adoption, that is one way that we’re paving the path.
Mr. Allen: Is there anything you’d specifically – like, because you talked about having, you know, more irons in the fire. Can you just sort of give an example of an area where you’ve collaborated with DIU, for example?
Mr. Fanelli: Sure. So the idea of how we’re doing cyber has changed drastically specifically for us over the last 18 months. And so we have some cyber anomaly detection, but we have gone to DIU that says, hey, most people are fully tasked with their day job; what are some leap-ahead opportunities? We went out and we contracted with Defense Innovation Unit on some hybrid: How do we go from cloud to on-prem, and what does the SIPR to NIPR transfer process look like, and can you help us envision that? They went out, they pulled in DISA, they pulled in Army, and we did an evaluation. And we are looking at use cases right now where that applies to many different communities within the Navy, and then potentially has an enterprise stake.
There are other DIU projects that we’re doing. What is it, mobile virtual network operations? And so within Guam we pulled in a technology that was below our cut line. They helped with funding and piloting of that. And this is something that is allowing us to connect with more partners and increasing our resilience there. So what they’ve done is where there are things that aren’t necessarily making it above our cut line, or they’re on our radar but we can’t get there, they have force multiplied specifically in cases that help the combatant commands and help us to shape some of what could be within our PEOs and program offices and portfolio offices.
Mr. Allen: Alex, anything you’d like to add?
Dr. Miller: I actually have three organizations that I would bring.
First one is OSD’s Office of General Counsel, OGC.
Mr. Allen: Really? Not – you know, not many people are – (laughter) –
Dr. Miller: No, and it’s – and it’s –
Ms. Moore: A gun is to his head right now. (Laughter.)
Dr. Miller: And it’s because we do a lot of technology gatekeeping in the DOD based on the federal management regulations. And what I mean by that is –
Mr. Allen: Yeah. Some people – some people, like, look at the CIO organization like they’re the bad guy, but usually they’re following some random law written in the 1990s.
Dr. Miller: They’re following some regulation.
Mr. Allen: Yeah.
Dr. Miller: And what I mean by that is if I took – if I said I need a cup and this cup existed, if I have never used it in combat or warfighting, somebody’s going to go: That cup is TRL-4.
Mr. Allen: Prove it, yeah.
Dr. Miller: And I’m going to – I’m going to go: No, it’s real. It’s right there. I can use it. I drank out of it. But because of the way the rules are written, somebody’s going to go: No, no, no. You need RDT&E to bring that cup to bear. Even though I’m going, no, no, no, I’m using it. (Laughter.) So just bringing OGC along with us.
The second organization –
Mr. Allen: Because they’re part of your ability to hack the bureaucracy at scale, right?
Dr. Miller: Right. Right, that’s exactly it.
Mr. Allen: So push back on regulations. OK.
Dr. Miller: And shame on us if we are not helping our colleagues, because not everyone’s a technologist and they shouldn’t have to be to access technology. So shame on us if we are not going and going, hey, here’s what’s new, here’s what’s relevant, here’s what we mean by these terms.
And I’ll give you one: Development as written in the FAR and software development are fundamentally different concepts; they just use the same term. So making sure that they understand what we’re doing, and why, and the rationale, and making sure to – because they work on behalf of the secretary of defense, and they are protecting the secretary and the warfighters. So making sure that they’re not taking undue risk is what – is part of our job as well.
The second one is the Hill. Like, we have to continue to have conversations about what – everything that we’ve described is about flexibility and adaptability – adaptability to the fight and flexibility to move technology to the warfighter. And right now, that is not how we are funded. That is not how the budget works. We build line items, we do a program objective memorandum five years out, and then we pretend that we’re really good at guessing at what’s going to happen next. So making sure that our colleagues on the Hill who think that we have the flexibility to do this; who are really turned on to say, hey, go forth and do it; but at the end of the day we’re still bound by the interpretation of those rules.
And then the third one – and this is – this may be a little bit cliché – making sure industry knows that we want them at the table. They are our partners. We are not trying to shut anyone out. The government is really bad at developing most technology and we are really bad at competing with industry, so don’t do it. So making sure that they know, hey, this is still a partnership; we are still team America.
Mr. Fanelli: To that point, I mean, you have two sensational leaders here that are super connectors. And so we’ve all found “yes, if” people throughout the community, and the challenge now is how do we institutionalize that and how do we build on those. I mean, there are compounding wins that are coming out of this like Schrödinger’s cat gets the mouse, but can we make this easier for everybody. And so those are next steps, is getting the operational wins, getting the outcomes, and then making the barrier of entry for winning lower.
Mr. Allen: I think that’s a lovely point to end on. So I want to thank the three of you for coming to CSIS and sharing your insights and experiences, really moving the needle, as we said, on these incredible challenges. And I wish you all good luck with these three series of exercises in deserts and oasises that we talked about, and with the broader challenge of accelerating technology adoption for mission impact.
So this concludes our event. The replay will be available on YouTube and on the CSIS website, CSIS.org. Thanks.

Watch the full video here. This transcript is based on a translation of Maged Al-Madhaji's remarks from Arabic into English that was conducted after the event, rather than the simultaneous translation from the event, for precision.
Dr. Alterman: Good morning and welcome to CSIS. I'm Jon Alterman, senior vice president, Brzezinski Chair in Global Security and Geostrategy, and the director of the Middle East Program. It is my pleasure to welcome you and Maged Al-Madhaji. Maged is the co-founder of the Sana'a Center for Strategic Studies, has been a researcher on Yemen, and is one of the most prominent researchers and thinkers about public policy issues in Yemen. Yemen has been very much in our minds as Red Sea security is a growing problem for the world, but Yemen continues to suffer under a civil war that has been seething for many years and arguably has been going on for decades.
You all have translation ear sets. Maged will speak in Arabic. They should all be set to channel 2 for English. We have translation both ways. Maged is going to speak briefly at the beginning, we will engage in a conversation, and then we will open the floor to questions. If you are here, there is a paper on your seat with a QR code. You can type in questions there, and they will appear on this iPad. If you're watching at home, there should be a way to ask questions in the event and the YouTube links. We will first listen to Maged, then Maged and I will have a conversation, and then we'll open it up to discussion.
Maged, welcome to Washington and CSIS. I have been thinking a lot about Yemen in recent months. What should we be thinking about Yemen?
Mr. Al-Madhaji: Thank you very much, Jon. I'm so glad to be here in Washington, D.C., especially during what appears to so many people to be an ambiguous period due to the upcoming U.S. election. Yemen keeps reminding the world that there is a real problem brewing in the southern Red Sea. Recently, a ship with more than a million barrels of oil was hit, and this is the latest in a series of incidents perpetrated by the Houthis south of Yemen. What does this mean for the world?
The world discovered a group more daring than it had imagined while struggling for many years to normalize the situation in Yemen, amidst Saudi Arabia’s least popular war in the history of the region. I believe that, over a period of ten years, the war Saudi Arabia was waging in Yemen was indeed hugely unpopular. Everyone was saying that the richest country in the world was bombing the poorest country. What happened because of this? The Houthis grew and developed contrary to political and security expectations—constituting a surprise and a challenge.
The periods before and after October 7th are totally different. It's a new era in terms of how the world views the Houthis. Prior, people were preparing to normalize with the group. In this new era, they turned into a cause of severe concern, targeting international interests in an audacious and unprecedented manner. One million barrels of oil are now liable to be spilled in an extremely critical area. Basic interests connected to the Red Sea and the region’s security architecture has been transformed
The Houthis can now not only direct their missiles against oil facilities in the Gulf, but they can also target all trade movements that pose a threat to their agenda. October 7th changed the Houthis’ status and weight in the “axis of resistance.” The group proved their utility and strategic importance relative to other groups allied with Iran. They are a winning racehorse, bold, and with a growing agenda. What is the danger, and what is striking about this group? First, they have fewer calculations than Hezbollah. They do not have the same calculations as Hezbollah. They benefit from wider geography, a larger population, and the ability to absorb more strikes than other groups.
The Houthis have an excellent geographical location, so they can bargain. They also have well-developed military capabilities and minimal obligations. From a humanitarian and political perspective, no one can pressure them. They hold few political obligations toward the citizens they govern. This opportunity, location, and modus operandi will allow the Houthis to be very effective in the coming period. The international response is weak, and the U.S. does not have a real policy toward Yemen.
U.S. policy toward Yemen has been governed either by attempts to address security threats like al-Qaeda or by a desire to align with the interests of its key ally, Saudi Arabia. The lack of U.S. policy is worse than bad policy. U.S. policy on Yemen is continuously influenced by domestic electoral considerations. This influence is recognized both by adversaries of the United States and enemies of common international interests. There will always be an opportunity to exploit election periods like this one.
The Houthis are acting freely now because of the absence of U.S. policy and the election year. The U.S. faces electoral pressure to avoid escalation in the Red Sea, and the Houthis recognize this as a political opportunity they can exploit with minimal repercussions. The situation is concerning and could lead to later negative outcomes, because it reassures different groups that there will be no consequences for their actions.
The peace process in Yemen is at an impasse. We believe that under the current conditions of the UN-led roadmap, the Houthis would be granted a central role in Yemen. Given the group’s recent behavior, this outcome could have long-lasting consequences on regional security.
So far, it does not seem that the behavior of the Houthis in the Red Sea has transformed the nature of international engagement, particularly regarding the existing roadmap for Yemen. The roadmap remains an international political priority, but we believe that the implementation of the commitments outlined within it will increase the political and military strength of the Houthis. This empowerment will come at the expense of other parties in Yemen, especially the internationally recognized government. This is the general scene that opens the door to our discussion.
Dr. Alterman: For people who don't follow Yemen closely, it's very confusing. There has been a civil war going on since 2014, and Saudi intervention began in 2015. But for much of the world, they didn't have to care. Then, the Houthis began attacking Red Sea shipping after October 7th, and suddenly this has become an issue of global concern. Can you help us understand the relationships between the Yemeni civil war, the Saudi intervention, Gaza, and Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping? What's the connection between all of them?
Mr. Al-Madhaji: The war in Yemen has been going on for 10 years. The Houthis turned against other groups and went on to occupy the capital, Sana’a. The problem relates to the Saudi intervention, which after persisting for more than ten years, started to recede. The political will of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to effect a military outcome declined due to a series of developments and international pressures. This shift led to the creation of the roadmap aimed at ending the war in Yemen and reducing the high costs the international community was paying as a result of it.
The international community wants to get rid of this headache called the Yemen war. There was a settlement ready and a huge political reward for the winning party. Things were stable and the Houthis were poised to win at the end of the battle. It was a similar situation to the Taliban in Afghanistan and any other place with a fanatical group and political and military instability. October 7th changed the landscape completely. The Houthis began prioritizing the needs of the “Axis of Resistance” over their own. The group became involved in the military confrontation over Palestine, first with the drone attacks. So basically, what did October 7th do?
The events of October 7th disproved the political assessments that suggested the Houthis are largely independent from Tehran. On the contrary, the Houthis’ commitment to the “Axis of Resistance” is stronger than their commitment to their own political success. The Red Sea is a very important arena for understanding the extraordinarily deep relationship between Sana'a and Tehran. Tehran’s priorities will always outweigh those of Sana'a. Tehran’s political investment in the Houthis also brought higher returns than expected. As a result, the Houthis were elevated from an ally at the bottom of the ladder to an ally at the top of the ladder, representing greater opportunity than other Iran-backed groups.
The Houthis have the capacity to impress supporters of the “Axis of Resistance.” They have been able to gather more of its supporters behind them than Hezbollah. The Houthis were able to become an inspiring model for groups of young people who see that mobilization on behalf of Palestine has destroyed sectarian divisions. After October 7th, the Houthis proved their effectiveness through their relations with other dangerous groups. The expansion of the Houthis to the other side of the Red Sea, with the political and security deals reached with factions such as al-Shabaab, has proved that they are smarter than other groups affiliated with the axis of resistance. October 7th proved that the Houthis are the winning racehorse in the “Axis of Resistance” movement.
Dr. Alterman: It sounds like, from your description, the Houthi theory of victory is that they emerge as the major power brokers in Yemen. However, it also seems to me that by threatening global shipping, the Houthis have made their victory unthinkable for many powers in the region—not just the Saudis, but the Egyptians, the Americans, and the Europeans. Do you think that the Houthis have made a mistake by raising the profile of their conflict and making it unacceptable for them to emerge as winners?
Mr. Al-Madhaji: Normative political expectations do not align with Houthi behavior. For instance, the Houthis have not behaved as though they have won the battle in Yemen, but as though they must still act out commitments to their allies. A segment of the Houthis believe that they are positioned to win the war in Yemen, but the Houthis generally view themselves as bigger than just Yemen.
The deal that only gives them north Yemen is not enough for them. October 7th allowed them to redefine their political presence, not just as a local group, but as an actor with regional aspirations that can reformulate their role in the region. The behavior of Abdul Malik al-Houthi changed after October 7. He speaks differently from his podium and is now addressing a wider audience. He now presents himself as a great Islamic leader who is confronting Western designs of the region.
The Houthis’ aspirations are no longer limited to administering their presence in Yemen, although their military strategy still revolves around maintaining and expanding Houthi control of strategic resources, which are still in the hands of their adversaries. Their behavior, and nature of the coalitions that lead the group, suggest that their aspirations are broader.
Dr. Alterman: You said, as I've heard former U.S. ambassadors to Yemen say, that the United States has very rarely had a policy toward Yemen. Yemen has always been secondary to other policies that the U.S. is pursuing in the Middle East. As you pointed out, we have an election, there's an opportunity for the United States to have a policy toward Yemen. I'm especially interested in your view of what the goals of U.S. policy should be. You've described the Houthi vision of victory. What should the U.S. concept of a successful Yemen policy look like?
Mr. Al-Madhaji: U.S. policy toward Yemen only has been governed by security considerations, more specifically, interacting with the country as an area of concern because of Sunni extremist groups—namely the Islamic State group (ISG) and al-Qaeda. Beyond that, the political approach of the U.S. in Yemen has been to meet the interests of regional partners such as Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. Oman’s political priorities and national security interests were also considered. Yemen did not pose such a direct threat to international interests, but now the nature of these threats has changed radically.
The threats have grown larger than al-Qaeda and lone wolf attackers blowing themselves up on airplanes. Now, the threats posed by Yemen are changing the rules of international trade and leading to the rise of insurance prices in the Red Sea. Therefore, the United States must have a policy that ensures international interests are not threatened by what is happening in Yemen. Yemen is not a country locked in the middle of Asia, like Afghanistan, which can be given up. It is near the main maritime trade corridors in the world, on the doorstep of the southern Red Sea. U.S. policy must ensure international interests are protected and guarantee that there is a political balance among the parties in Yemen so that Houthis cannot overcome other groups.
Certainly, it is not possible to eradicate any party in Yemen, including the Houthis, but it is possible to support a political, economic, and military balance in the country that averts Houthi domination. If the group is able to dominate the country and move on to the next stage of international legitimation of its rule, they will be able to change the rules of the game in the Arabian Peninsula and the southern Red Sea.
This is an important strategic region that involves China, Russia, and many of the other parties that are active militarily in the Red Sea. The coast of Yemen overlooks the bank where the first Chinese military base in the region sits. China sees Yemen as an important corridor for its trade with Europe. Russia believes that there may be an opportunity to hurt the United States through Yemen. U.S. policy must ensure its capacity to neutralize these threats. This will only be achieved by fostering strong relationships with Yemeni partners that serve their interests and the interests of the United States beyond Riyadh and Abu Dhabi.
Dr. Alterman: To what extent does a successful U.S. policy have to address the distribution of power in Yemen and the way Yemeni political interests engage with each other? To what extent does it need to weaken the Houthis as a force? To what extent does the United States have to encourage what has been at least a stated goal of U.S. policy to improve the Yemeni economy and social conditions. The number of things that Yemen needs for prosperity is very long. Does that have to be a goal of policy? If not, what are the things that the United States absolutely needs to achieve?
Mr. Al-Madhaji: I think the roadmap being discussed right now must be reconsidered because it fails to contain the Houthis, and it will give them more strength. That should not happen. The United States must also be open to other options related to clearer political, military, and financial support for anti-Houthi parties. This will readjust the balance of power in the country. It will also give the United States leverage to better manage its individual and international interests in the Red Sea. It will reduce existing dangers.
Currently, all the policy constraints are applied only to the legitimate regions of Yemen. The legitimate governmental authorities were trying to monitor the Houthis’ financial operations to weaken their control and financial flows, but those efforts were sabotaged by misguided policy interference. At the heart of any U.S. policy toward Yemen should be an effort to help make the anti-Houthi camp more balanced and stable. So, yes, the United States must be tougher on the Houthis. It should be clearer in neutralizing risks and intervening in favor of the Houthis’ opponents.
Dr. Alterman: To make sure I understood you correctly, what I heard you say was that the United States needs to support efforts to put more pressure on the Houthis through economic and military means. The Emiratis were criticized, partly on a sectarian basis, for enlisting what others said were jihadi groups to fight the Houthis. How should the United States think about the military piece? How much should the United States do the fighting, how much should it support others to do the fighting, and how should it differentiate between groups that are acceptable to engage with and groups that aren't acceptable to engage with?
Mr. Al-Madhaji: The United States should go through the official political process in its engagement with Yemen. There is a national army and other military forces present under the Presidential Leadership Council, including the Joint Forces on Yemen’s western coast. Of course, some are salafists, and we know that this is controversial and raises many concerns—especially about sectarian conflict. However, there are different forces in Yemen. There are legitimate political officials represented in the Presidential Council. They enjoy legal legitimacy and have armed forces associated with the Ministry of Defense. The United States should support some sort of unified military body among these parties.
We're not asking for U.S. boots on the ground. This would be costly and would not meet the needs of Yemenis. It would anger many parties and not be a popular policy. However, the U.S. must support a more aggressive Houthi containment strategy. It should support the ability of the opposition parties to coordinate a concerted military effort against the Houthis. This is feasible because these legitimate military forces follow a military leadership with a legal and legitimate status in the Presidential Council. Some opponents of the Houthis are dangerous, but this issue affects the interests of everyone, not just the United States. Some Yemenis are also worried that religious factions might be given an opportunity to seize control in a vulnerable country like Yemen. I agree with you on this. At the same time, this problem cannot be solved by ignoring the legitimate groups in Yemen. We must strengthen those parties.
Dr. Alterman: What is the role of all the international actors? Which international actors should be involved? There’s been a UN role, a Saudi role, an Emirati role, a U.S. role, and a UK role. Is that the right group of international actors, and what should that group, or some other group, be doing that they're not doing right now?
Mr. Al-Madhaji: There are more actors in Yemen than just that group. It’s not just the United States, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates that are central players in Yemen. There are additional agendas and political interests at play. For example, we have the Sultanate of Oman, which is a political ally of the Houthis and has enabled them. Oman is also a mediator, but it has played a decisive role in the political and military development of the Houthis. Oman is indeed directly involved in Yemen. For a period, Qatar was a dominant actor in Yemen, in terms of financing and involvement. The Emirates and Saudi Arabia are now decisive parties in the equation, as well as the United States.
Any discussion about Yemen that does not recognize the concerns of regional parties will not succeed in producing a settlement. The more Saudi Arabia made its Gulf neighbors angry or concerned, the more these countries financed its adversaries in Yemen. Yemen is a sea of sand in which Gulf relations are rising and sinking. All the proxy conflicts are playing out there.
What does this dynamic mean? It means you have to deal with the situation because it will only lead to the empowerment of dangerous groups like the Houthis, ISG, or extreme salafists. The salafists also have ambitions that make many parties anxious.
Dr. Alterman: It sounds to me that the strategy of putting more pressure on the Houthis, economically and militarily, is the policy that the Saudis and the Emiratis have been pursuing since 2015. What are they doing wrong?
Mr. Al-Madhaji: There was a lot of corruption. There were a lot of erroneous assessments. And more importantly, the war was unpopular globally. It was framed as a few of the richest countries fighting against one of the poorest countries—although this was not an accurate characterization of the situation. Additionally, before October 7th, people thought that the issues in Yemen were a small problem. Now, the damage is huge, and it's not only a regional threat. It’s a global threat.
Earlier, the damage used to only be a source of concern for countries in the region. Now, it worries the entire world. We are no longer the only ones hurt directly. I always give an example of how the Houthis’ behavior in the Red Sea will manifest in the future, as this is the main issue. Many parties are currently waiting for the Gaza war to end with the expectation that the threat from the Red Sea will subside. But for the Houthis, the situation is no longer about Gaza. They are pursuing a political opportunity through a method that will continue to allow them to ratchet up pressure on others as a means of reducing pressure on themselves.
If somebody burns a copy of the Qur’an in Stockholm, the Houthis will respond by targeting Swedish ships in the southern Red Sea. If somebody, or a right-wing politician in some country “insults Islam,” the Houthis will respond in a manner which serves their interests. We will not see a more rule-abiding or calmer version of the group. This is what the world now realizes. This is the difference between now and the ten years that preceded October 7th. Therefore, any sort of tough approach requires recognizing the Houthis as a threat to shared regional and global interests.
Dr. Alterman: I just have a few more questions. I would encourage members of our audience to use the sheets to send questions using the QR code. If you're watching at home or in your office, please send a question through the event page on the CSIS website or in the comments section on the YouTube stream. Maged, how do the Houthis make money?
Mr. Al-Madhaji: The Houthis are better at nothing than making money. They impose large taxes. They get oil from Iran and sell it domestically. They have a big business of selling ammunition from Yemeni territory. The Houthis are one of the most important vendors of ammunition in Africa, especially to rogue groups. According to our information, and we follow this closely, Sana'a is now viewed as dominant in in the East African ammunition market. They sell ammunition for pistols, Kalashnikovs, and other weapons. The Houthis produce locally in factories that were used by the Yemeni military and have since been developed further by the group.
They sell to Somalia, Sudan, and the Central African Republic. The ammunition also goes to other places around the world. The Houthis can collect money from everything imaginable. They lead and engage with smuggling networks that bring hashish into Saudi territory. This was an ancient trade that was carried out by independent contractors, and now the Houthis dominate these smuggling operations.
They can collect exceptional amounts of money while having no public obligations to fund. The Houthis do not pay for hospitals; the United Nations does this. They do not pay salaries to government employees despite the fact the Houthis collect three times the amount that the internationally recognized government collects in legitimate areas. And now, the international roadmap gives the Houthis the ability to pay the salaries of their soldiers and employees, as well as fund their activities using Yemeni wealth and strategic resources. Fundamentally, we are helping the Houthis become richer.
Dr. Alterman: Were you surprised that the Saudi-Iranian agreement last March in Beijing didn't have more of an impact on Houthi behavior, on Houthi relations with the Saudis? Was that a surprise to you or did you not expect it to have any impact?
Mr. Al-Madhaji: It did not have influence on the situation in Yemen. It did not change anything. Its only purpose was to protect Saudi Arabia from Houthi attacks. It did, however, curb Saudi Arabia’s willingness to support its political and military allies. In this sense, the deal had a negative impact on the balance of power, especially given that Iran remained committed to supporting its allies politically and militarily. Saudi Arabia was able to neutralize the Houthis from posing a threat to them through the agreement, but not restrain them from carrying out attacks against opponents at home or in the Red Sea. Chinese trade exporters who use the Bab al-Mandeb Strait to reach Europe have now even been affected.
Dr. Alterman: Before I go to the question, and there's some excellent questions here—thank you for that—can you describe the impacts of the war on the tens of millions of Yemenis? There's been a war in the north for more than 20 years. There's been a war that's ravaged much of the country for almost a decade. What does that mean for Yemen? What does it do for Yemen? How does it affect tens of millions of Yemenis all over the country?
Mr. Al-Madhaji: Let me give you some examples. Yemenis, not just the bulk of the population that resides in Houthi controlled areas, have not received salaries for 10 years. The remaining population in areas controlled by the government are also suffering, as the government has struggled to pay salaries ever since the Houthis targeted the oil sources. Due to the blockade on food at the Yemeni ports and the complexities of shipping, import costs are very inflated. This is a country that imports 90 percent or more of its goods.
This also led to a rise in container costs from $3,000 to approximately $7,000 or $8,000 even prior to October 7th. After the Houthi intervention in the Red Sea, the cost rose from $7,000 per container to $15,000. I am talking about shipments coming from China. These are numbers that affect the daily lives of citizens, including their ability to buy rice and wheat. Essentially, Yemenis do not have the capacity to buy the simplest goods, and the few things that do enter the country have become more expensive. After the Houthi attack on Tel Aviv, which resulted in an Israeli casualty, insurance companies again increased costs following Israel’s targeting of the Hodeidah port. We are talking about prices above what people can handle.
In addition to the destruction of infrastructure, which has led to the obstruction of the trade and the cessation of commercial businesses, Yemen is paying the price for climate change. There are massive rains in Yemen. There are floods that have not stopped for over a month. This extreme weather has struck impoverished areas in Yemen. The war has disrupted the natural flow of life in Yemen, and for over ten years, Yemenis have been living in unprecedented levels of poverty.
Dr. Alterman: I'm going to turn to the questions. I’ll tell you now, we're not going to get to all of them. You've elicited a number of very interesting and difficult questions, and one is: the World Food Programme (WFP) and other humanitarian groups have had ongoing challenges providing food assistance to Yemenis. What's the path forward to ensure that food can consistently get to those in need? Part of that question involves the Houthis' insistence on getting payment or taxing food that goes into Houthi controlled areas.
Mr. Al-Madhaji: Houthis not only impose taxes; they also divert most of the aid to the hands of their followers. We have published a series of reports on how humanitarian aid has been redirected. The problem with the food distribution process is that it does not guarantee the arrival of food. Before the reductions in humanitarian assistance, our reports said that around 70-80 percent of the core aid went only to those loyal to the Houthi movement. Moreover, a substantial portion of that aid is being used to directly fund military operations or benefit Houthi fighters. This has always been a subject of great controversy. How does the WFP monitor the delivery of aid? There have been struggles on many levels about the Houthis continuously imposing their conditions, but in general, the international community was happy to pay the bill and didn’t do their due diligence on where things ended up. This has changed now. There are discussions between the UN and the Houthis regarding humanitarian aid and medicine, but this is not enough.
The issues have not yet been resolved. They have not set any limits. About two months ago, the Houthis carried out a coordinated attack against activists, humanitarian workers, and employees of international organizations and UN agencies. This includes the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit, which has now closed its office in north Yemen. Around 100 local Yemeni humanitarian workers are detained. Any local humanitarian employee, because of the lack of protection afforded to them, cannot help but comply with Houthi dictates. Otherwise, they will be accused of spying for the United States. The Houthis gathered the managers of international organizations, including the resident representative of the UN in Yemen, in a hall like this one and gave a speech where they chanted their slogan and insulted the female UN employees. Despite the unprecedented scene, the United Nations said nothing. There is not a red line drawn by international organizations toward the Houthis that has not been violated by the group. There has been no response.
Dr. Alterman: What should people do about that?
Mr. Al-Madhaji: Establish red lines. Barriers should be set. The Houthis stormed the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and looted materials, including testimonies of victims, who were supposed to feel safe with their confessions being conveyed to the OHCHR. For three days, the Houthis tampered with these documents, compromised the information, and then handed them over to the United Nations. The UN did not say anything, except for a short statement, which did not say that some operations will be suspended or that meetings with Houthi political leaders will stop. The UN has to do something. How can we expect that their employees adhere to international humanitarian standards if no protection is offered to them? We must start establishing harder red lines, and there must be a response if Houthis cross them.
Dr. Alterman: I'm still not sure how one deals with the Houthis when they cross the red lines, because they've been crossing red lines on security in the Red Sea. Let me ask you about security in the Red Sea or a number of questions about the U.S. military operations attacking launch sites in Yemen. Some say the U.S. should be even more aggressive. How should the U.S. think about the military component of its Yemen strategy? How do Yemenis perceive U.S. and allied military operations in the Red Sea?
Mr. Al-Madhaji: I cannot give advice to the U.S. Department of Defense on how to target the Houthis. This is not the platform for that. I think we all realize that right now in its military dynamic with the United States, the Houthis are the political victor. In their military actions, the United States and the United Kingdom have harmed the Houthis little, and the Houthis have been able to present themselves as heroes fighting against the United States for the sake of Palestine.
Over three months, the United States has paid for expensive missiles to be shot down by cheap drones. This is not a problem for Yemenis; it might be a tax problem for Americans. The problem for Yemenis is that the United States’ response is weak and makes the Houthis appear stronger, able to withstand attacks from the United States, and deal blows in return. Therefore, for many angry people and extremists, the United States made the Houthis into heroes.
Dr. Alterman: Let me ask again: what's the solution? If the current strategy of relieving civilian suffering strengthens the Houthis because they either tax or steal the assistance, what can the United States and its allies do differently to get different outcomes?
Mr. Al-Madhaji: Here is a simple and direct answer. The United States need not increase its military activity in Yemen, because this is not wanted and enjoys little popularity. The U.S. should invest more in the military and political opponents of the Houthis. This is the only available path.
Dr. Alterman: Do you have ideas about how the United States and its allies can increase economic pressure on the Houthis without endangering vulnerable Yemenis who live under Houthi control?
Mr. Al-Madhaji: You have to trace the warlords that are making financial gains. There are many financial institutions, money changers, and merchants who have established networks in Houthi territories. The Houthis have been able to bury money among them. When imposing sanctions, the United States needs to ensure that it does not cause harm to the fragile and weak commercial structure in Yemen. It must make distinctions between merchants who existed before and after 2015. You need to account for the political pressure that may be exerted on some large merchants and industrial companies, forcing them to serve Houthi interests. These entities should be granted exceptions as the United States seeks to undermine the Houthis financially.
Houthi money moves through Salalah, Dubai, Oman, Riyadh, and the south of the Kingdom. They have many investments in China and other places. There are commercial agents who establish agencies in Yemen, as well as businessmen and financiers affiliated with the Houthis. There are some efforts underway to crack down on these networks. Recently, the Ministry of the Treasury has been issuing semi-periodic official regulatory directives on the topic.
I think we are on the right track, but we must differentiate between harm to the economic allies of the Houthi movement and harm to the fragile trade movement in Yemen. This requires greater effort in tracking and investigating the sources of the Houthis’ wealth, how it moves, and who buries it.
Dr. Alterman: Somebody notes that you said the Houthis are working with al-Shabaab. What does “working with al-Shabaab"" mean? Is it sharing money, arms, bases, members, messaging, ideas, WhatsApp groups? I mean, when you say they're working, what does that really mean?
Mr. Al-Madhaji: There is coordination and an alliance between the two parties. One of the Houthis’ military commanders, Abdulwahid abu Ras, recently appointed deputy foreign minister, paved the way for greater military and political coordination between the two groups. There are multiple sources which indicate that the two parties met. In the early 1990s, the Somali pirates and the Shabaab movement reshaped the security picture in the Gulf of Aden and the outskirts of the Indian Ocean through their various attacks. This led to the deployment of U.S. military ships to the area twenty years ago, in addition to those sent by other countries.
The Houthis are now threatening international interests in the southern Red Sea. On one side of the sea is the Houthi movement, and on the other side is the Shabaab movement. If these groups strengthen their collaboration, we will witness things like more information exchanges and more coordinated military responses by the two most dangerous groups on the Gulf of Aden. If the scope of this issue expands, and the Houthis manage to shatter all barriers, then this will need to be dealt with in addition to an ISG presence in Kassala and southern Sudan, the Portland Mountains, and the Somali ports. The southern Red Sea region is an area with extensive political and social marginalization. There are many angry groups for the Houthis to invest in.
Dr. Alterman: What would Houthi escalationlook like? Do you think it is possible that the Houthis will once again attack Saudi Arabia? Will they once again attack the United Arab Emirates? If we do get to a ceasefire in Gaza, will that have any impact on Houthi military operations in the Red Sea?
Mr. Al-Madhaji: The Houthis still have different options in the Red Sea. If my characterization is correct, security intervention is a form of limited military pressure that ensures civil goals are met but does not lead to too severe of an escalation in targeting U.S. ships. The Houthis possess the ability to launch more intensive drone and missile salvos, posing a real threat to vessels. There has not yet been a widespread deployment of sea mines, yet they have the capacity to do this. The Houthis control a chain of islands in the middle of the Red Sea, including Kamaran Island, and if they spread sea mines around regional waters, the group can do much damage. Therefore, the Houthis are still pursuing a policy of calculated escalation.
The Houthis have unmanned submarines, sea mines, and missiles that they haven't used a lot. These remain strategic weapons for the group. I believe that they can indeed harm international military assets in the Red Sea. These are dangerous avenues that I think the Houthis can escalate through when it suits them. The Houthis have military capabilities to harm oil facilities in Saudi Arabia or in the Emirates. They have the full spectrum of military capabilities, because they have accumulated a significant and dangerous military reserve over the past years.
In the event of a ceasefire or truce in Gaza, I think that the Houthis will halt their activities to send a message that they are true to the declared goals of their operations. However, will this mean that they will stop their operations in the southern Red Sea and Bab al-Mandeb when it again becomes politically convenient? No, this will not happen. If they feel threatened, if one of their allies in the “Axis of Resistance” feel threatened, or if the Houthis want to send a political message or increase their popularity, they will again use low-cost drones to target ships passing through this trade corridor.
Dr. Alterman: Should we be paying special attention to oil tankers? Are they paying special attention to oil tankers? What is their interest?
Mr. Al-Madhaji: They feel that the political benefits and the media attention they receive when they target oil ships is higher compared to other vessels. They began targeting them on a regular basis after attacking the Greek ship that is likely to sink. Two other ships have now been targeted, one of which CENTCOM announced was a Saudi oil tanker and the other was a ship flying under the Panamanian flag. These two incidents took place directly after the attack on the Greek oil ship. Targeting oil tankers is a core priority of the Houthis’ military strategy. They realize that the more harm they cause, the larger the gains. The specific question is: who determines these goals? Are they determined by the Houthis only, or are they determined by the the “Axis of Resistance”?
Dr. Alterman: Let me ask a slightly unfair question: In 2018, the Emiratis were threatening to attack the Houthis in Hodeidah, and the Americans leaned on the Emiratis and said, ""Do not do that."" And they reached the Stockholm Agreement, and we have sort of been in a stalemate since. In your judgment, was that a mistake of U.S. policy to not have a major military operation deal a a military blow to the Houthis? Or do you think we would be in a difficult situation, as we are now, either way?
Mr. Al-Madhaji: Yes, it was a big mistake many of us committed. There would have been a cost, definitely, but there will always be a humanitarian cost to any military action that changes the political landscape. If the attacking troops had won in the battle for Hodeidah, it would have changed the whole balance, the whole military scene, and we could have avoided a lot of what we're witnessing right now. The political and military size of the Houthi group would have been much smaller than it is now. The opportunity to achieve a political settlement based on a political balance would have been possible.
Yes, in 2018 the United States and the international community made a grave mistake. The Joint Forces were only 2 kilometers from the port of Hodeidah. There would have been a cost to pay for four or five months. Now we have been paying the cost for more than seven years.
Dr. Alterman: Maged Al-Madhaji, I haven't run out of questions, but I have run out of time. I want to thank you very much for coming, for honoring us, and for having such a thoughtful and wide-ranging discussion. I want to thank the audience here and the audience on the internet. We certainly hope to continue conversations about Yemen, and hopefully we will get to the point where you feel there is a U.S. policy on Yemen that is leading toward a better life for Yemenis and Americans alike. Thank you.
Mr. Al-Madhaji: Thank you, Dr. Alterman.

29,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/do-leaders-want-gaza-negotiations-succeed,Jon B. Alterman,"August 9, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"For most of the last month, reports have circulated that a Gaza ceasefire is close. The war has imposed difficult costs on Israel and unleashed destruction on Gaza. Even more urgently, the suffering of the hostages that Hamas holds and the hunger and disease that threatens almost all Palestinians argue for a swift end to hostilities in order to preserve human lives. Negotiators believe that they have arrived at bridgeable positions, and the principal mediators—the United States, Qatar, and Egypt—have called for the parties to gather on Thursday, August 15, to reach an agreement.
While the meeting may take place, there is no good public evidence that either leadership believes it is done fighting.
It is important to start with a caveat. The mediators may know something that is not yet public. They also may have intelligence about the Israeli and Hamas leaderships that gives them optimism. But to an outside observer, it certainly feels like the two leaders who matter here—Binyamin Netanyahu and Yahya Sinwar—think there is more to be gained by fighting than settling right now.
Let’s start with Netanyahu. He believes that Israeli forces are degrading Hamas in Gaza and that Sinwar’s popularity is diminishing as the war drags on. His daring assassinations of Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut and Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran elicited amazement at Israeli capabilities and confusion in Tehran about how to respond. He believes that U.S. efforts to prevent an all-out regional war will help protect Israel from retribution, and that the Biden administration has little appetite to constrain the resupply of Israeli munitions.
Politically, his popularity in Israel is falling, but no alternative is emerging. More importantly to him, the right-wing allies necessary to his ruling coalition are remaining in line while continually warning of their imminent defections if he makes concessions. Pressure is growing on Netanyahu to negotiate the release of hostages, but Netanyahu has resisted such pressure before. When Hamas kidnapped Israeli corporal Gilad Shalit in 2006, he remained in captivity for more than five years while Netanyahu negotiated his release. One of the more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners released in exchange for Shalit’s freedom was Yahya Sinwar, which surely weighs heavily on Netanyahu.
Interestingly, Netanyahu did not use his recent visit to the United States to strike new agreements or advance new ideas. Instead, he reinforced his positions—partly for a domestic audience in Israel—and sensed whether U.S. support was fragile. There are few signs that he came away concerned. If anything, he may have concluded that President Joe Biden’s deep emotional support for Israeli security is stronger than that of either of Biden’s potential successors, providing Israel with a window to continue operations.
But equally important is Netanyahu’s conviction that war is often necessary and that now is such a time. He never bought into the idea put forward by his political opponents that a “New Middle East” was in reach, or that “Land for Peace” represented a solution to Israel’s security challenges. Much as the United States saw its 45-year Cold War with the Soviet Union, or as it now sees global competition with China, he sees Israel as condemned to a future of enduring contestation. Further, he believes that U.S. officials are profoundly misguided in seeking to apply the counterinsurgency lessons of two decades of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to what Israel is doing in Gaza. Instead, it is the effective U.S. degradation of al Qaeda’s capabilities—including the assassinations of both Osama bin Laden and Ayman Zawahiri as well as the targeted killings of dozens of other leaders and operatives—that should guide Israeli actions.
To judge from outward appearances, then, Netanyahu is seeking to take advantage of a window to continue fighting and degrading Hamas. Netanyahu will continue to kill Hamas fighters, and he will embed Israel further on the Egypt-Gaza border. A low-grade war in which he enjoys U.S. protection and which allows him to inflict damage on any Iranian forces or proxies that threaten Israel will reinforce perceptions of Israeli strength and capabilities and, in the near and medium term, reinforce Israeli deterrence.
Yahya Sinwar seems equally committed to fighting. Part of his goal in attacking Israel on October 7 was to isolate Israel both in the region and in the world, and that isolation is increasing. What had been seen as Israel’s inevitable integration with Arab states has completely stalled and is likely to be slowed by future frustrations over Gaza’s reconstruction, whenever that happens.
But even more importantly, Sinwar sees Gaza’s current destruction as purposive. Rather than seeing the tens of thousands of dead Palestinians as victims of Israeli aggression, he sees them as martyrs to the Palestinian cause. Sinwar spent more than two decades in Israeli prisons, where he learned good Hebrew and worked to understand Israeli society. But he also seems to have grown more committed to the necessity of struggle, strongly opposing the very agreement that won his freedom in 2011. Sinwar seems to embrace the idea that he will die a martyr’s death, killed at some point by Israel. His goals before then are twofold: (1) to kill as many Israelis as possible, and (2) to be remembered as the one who catalyzed the changes that will, perhaps over decades, expel Jews from historic Palestine and reinstate Arab sovereignty over Jerusalem.
As a practical matter, the assassination of Haniyeh (who was often a negotiator), and the elevation of Sinwar in his place, makes it less likely that Hamas will agree to a halt in fighting right now. Haniyeh was a willing negotiator, while Sinwar is a fighter. Who will negotiate in Haniyeh’s absence, and how that negotiator will win the confidence of his successor, Sinwar—who ultimately commands the fighting forces in Gaza—remains unclear, especially a week after Haniyeh’s death. In addition, the region remains on tenterhooks as it waits for an Iranian response to the Haniyeh assassination in Tehran, and the Israeli counter-response.
It remains possible that this could all work out. Netanyahu can conclude that he has demonstrated sufficient strength through two assassinations. Sinwar is keen to maintain Palestinian support, and he may be confident that Hamas can melt into the broader Palestinian national movement and rebuild itself on the seeds of Gaza’s reconstruction. Certainly, the families of more than a hundred Israeli hostages are desperate for progress, and millions of Palestinians cry out for relief. But it remains hard to get over the perception that Netanyahu and Sinwar believe that they are fighting for their people’s survival, that they are winning the long game, and that now is not the time to flinch.

31,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/ambassador-nicholas-burns-us-china-relationship,Unknown,"July 25, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS podcast published on July 25, 2024. Listen to podcast here.
Jude Blanchette: China has emerged as one of the 21st century's most consequential nations, making it more important than ever to understand how the country is governed. Welcome to Pekingology, the podcast that unpacks China's evolving political system. I'm Jude Blanchette, the Freeman Chair in China Studies at CSIS, and this week I'm joined by Nick Burns, a career diplomat, currently serving as the United States Ambassador to China since 2022. Today we'll be discussing his views on the current state of the US-China relationship.
Ambassador Burns, thank you for joining the podcast.
Ambassador Nicholas Burns: Thanks Jude. Really nice to be with you.
Mr. Blanchette: Ambassador Burns, if I may, I'd like to ask you the question we ask all guests, which is a biographical one. I'm curious how you got interested in Asia and China, any early experiences or formative experiences that drew you to the region?
Amb. Burns: Jude, thanks and it's very, very good to be with you on this podcast. I was an American Foreign Service Officer. I started as an intern in 1980 in Nouakchott, Mauritania and my early experience in the foreign service was in West Africa and the Middle East. But I had a chance in 1988, when I was a young officer, to work for Secretary of State George Shultz. And I traveled to Asia for the very first time with him in the summer of 1988 to nine countries. It was an extraordinary learning experience for me. And one of them, of course, was Beijing, where he met with the Chinese leadership. And of course it was an eyeopener in 1988 to see China that had just emerged the decade before from the cultural revolution from the Mao era, trying to find its way forward to develop itself. This huge economic expansion, historic expansion started back then.
So I was here then I came back in 1989 with President George H. W. Bush. I was a young staffer at the State Department and was here before Tiananmen in February ‘89 on his first trip as president in his first 30 days as president to meet Deng Xiaoping. And then came back, I was not a China specialist, came back when I State Department Spokesperson with both Secretary Warren Christopher. I was with Madeleine Albright, Secretary Albright on June 30th, 1997 in Hong Kong at the handover. And then as a more senior officer when I was under Secretary of State, worked closely with the Chinese leadership on Iran sanctions on North Korea, on Afghanistan, on Iraq, the great issues of 2005, ‘6, ‘7, ‘8 when I was under secretary. So had a pretty good sense of the Chinese leadership, of our bilateral relationship, but I had never lived in China.
And so when President Biden asked me to be ambassador back in 2021, I was, you know, honored by the appointment obviously. And for my wife, Libby, and I now, over the last two and a half years, to live in this country, to learn this incredibly difficult but beautiful language – try to learn Mandarin, to travel around the country. It's been an honor and it's been fascinating. So I've had a long journey here. I would say one more thing, Jude, our embassy here in Beijing, our consulates in Shenyang, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Shanghai are filled with young American foreign service officers, civil servants, military officers who are China specialists. And so they’re people like you who've mastered Mandarin, who've been focused on China more or less as their key focus as American diplomats. And I'm so grateful that we have that young core here. I'm not one of those people, I'm not a career long China specialist the way they are, but we really need to see in the next generation of Americans into the ‘20s and ‘30s, that kind of commitment to understand this extraordinary country.
Mr. Blanchette: Yeah. And I have always just been so extraordinarily impressed with how deep the bench is in the United States government, but especially the State Department, of folks who just have such a granular understanding of all aspects of China, its economy, society, its political system. It really is quite impressive.
Ambassador Burns, I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask you. Of course wanna ask you about, about the U.S.-China relationship, but let me ask you to put your China analyst hat on. We just had the completion of the third plenum last week, and on Sunday night our time, we finally got the plenum decision. Everyone here has hot takes about the plenum and what it means, but it's a rare opportunity to have someone on the ground there. How did you interpret the plenum? What for you were the big takeaways?
Amb. Burns: Well, for, for those listening to this podcast who may not know about plenums, these are very important sessions that give the Chinese leadership an opportunity to think about and then communicate their long-term economic strategy for the most part. And so we're just now digesting over the last couple of days some of the documents that came out, as you say Sunday, here in Beijing about the plenum. I think it's too early, Jude, to draw any kind of definite conclusions about what policy changes in the economic sphere might emerge from this because the Chinese tradition is to maybe not reveal everything about the plenum at first blush. We're gonna see some speeches that will be published in the next couple of weeks or even months that will give us a much more granular and specific idea of exactly what they intend to do in terms of economic policy.
So I would just say that a little bit too early to draw definite conclusions. But two points. First, as I listen to all the economists here, and I've talked to Chinese and American and international economists about the plenum, I think there's a feeling that this seems to be like a status quo plenum, that major economic changes are not being forecast. And yet many economists to whom I listen, say the big challenge here is to stimulate consumption by the people of China in order to drive economic growth forward. There was not a lot in the plenum about spurring consumption. Other people say it's important to build a stronger social safety net, healthcare, pension system. Well that doesn't seem at this point to have been a priority in the plenum as well. And so I think if there's criticism of the plenum and, and I'm just kind of observing the criticism right now because I think I wanna withhold judgment. That's what you're hearing from economists. Not enough stimulus, not enough attention to the property sector.
But I think the point for Americans and for American policy and for our administration is what did come through in the plenum. In the speeches and in the documents is this Chinese focus on the new productive forces that China wants to stimulate production in lithium batteries, in electric vehicles, in solar panels, and really exceed the, the demand here at home and have a major surge of exports of these products in order to drive economic growth. That's gonna be a problem for the United States and for many other countries of the world. And I think it's gonna drive trade tensions even further than they are. The basic problem that we have identified, and Secretary Janet Yellen was very vocal about this when she was here a couple of months ago on a six-day visit, is that China seems to be keying on producing two to three times domestic demand in some of these categories, exporting these products at artificially low prices often below the cost of production. So classic definition of dumping, and dumping them on foreign markets in a way to gain market share and to compete – in our sense – unfairly against domestic producers outside of China.
So you've seen this big reaction from Turkey against what's happening, from the European Union, from Canada, from Brazil, from Mexico, and certainly from the United States. We're all concerned that China is going to, in a very blatantly unfair way, try to outcompete, unfairly, domestic industries in our countries. And we're not gonna tolerate it. You've seen the EU begin this process of tariff hikes. President Biden already announced 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs, substantial tariffs in other categories. We are not gonna abide a second China shock where Americans lose their jobs in huge numbers because China is not playing by the rules.
So I think that, in the wake of the plenum, is the issue that leaps out at me and at my government and at many other governments around the world. I think this is a very unwise decision by the Chinese leadership.
Mr. Blanchette: Ambassador Burns, just to follow up on that, do you think there is any space in Beijing to make any comprehensive course correction on this? Because in some sense it seems like the wave of exports we're seeing now is the apotheosis of the Xi Jinping vision of political economy, right? Double down on state support and subsidies for some of these export oriented key sectors with the idea that China will be surging exports out to global markets. And that, that seems to be crashing into the reality that advanced democracies have really woken up to this and are saying we're not gonna allow a China Shock 2.0.
I'm just curious, you're on the ground there. Do you get any sense that the leadership in Beijing has any interest or appetite to make that course correction that I think many from Brussels, as you say to Turkey, to the U.S., are asking them to make?
Amb. Burns: Unfortunately Jude, I don't see any reconsideration and that's very disappointing.
When Secretary Yellen was here in a very long visit at the beginning of April, she had lengthy discussions with Vice Premier He Lifeng on this issue and other Chinese officials. And we really hoped that by outlining what a threat this was to the rest of the world and particularly to the United States, that there will be some reconsideration here. We've not seen it. In fact, I think one of the early takeaways from the plenum documents that have just been published is that the Chinese leadership is doubling down on an export driven strategy on these new productive forces. And as I said, that's gonna cause considerable trades tensions and there is going to be a reaction, a continued reaction from the rest of the world.
We had hoped that the Chinese would understand this is not 2000 again, it's not 2005, you know, we went through this terrible period in our country where well more than a million jobs were lost, in large part to this unfair trading practice of the Chinese and we're not gonna stand for it again. But we've not seen that kind of turnaround in Chinese thinking. We've seen a doubling down and that's gonna cause problems.
Mr. Blanchette: If I can ask you a question about the broader state of the U.S.-China relationship and how you see it from the vantage point of the embassy there in Beijing, we had this Woodside Summit last November, it appeared as if there was a mutual coincidence of wants in both Beijing and Washington to really try to stabilize the relationship. I have my own guesses about what was animating the Chinese desire for that stabilization.
Since November, it's been a rocky stabilization, you know, because of issues ranging from China's continued support for Russia, tensions in South China Sea over Second Thomas Shoal, PLA exercises after Taiwan President Lai Ching Te’s May 20th inauguration speech, Ambassador Xie Feng here in the United States telling a senior White House official that the fentanyl issue is quote not China's problem. So again, as an external observer watching this, it feels like this is a very fragile stabilization. How do you assess where the bilateral relationship is now, you know, eight months after the Woodside Summit?
Amb. Burns: Jude, I would say two things in response to your very good, and I think probably the key, question, is where are we now in the U.S.-China relationship? I was of course with President Biden at the Woodside Summit, and I do think point one that the relationship because of Woodside is relatively more stable now than it was in my first year here in 2022 and for much of 2023. Why do I say that? We went through a period between Speaker Pelosi's visit in August 2022 and the balloon crisis in February 2023 where we really had very few senior level consistent channels of communication between the two governments. And that was, I thought, a dangerous period in the sense that, you know, the two strongest militaries in the world, the two strongest economies in the world – you've got to have connectivity, and we didn't. And so we consciously set out to recreate those cabinet channels.
So you've seen now Secretary Blinken’s been here twice, Secretary Yellen's been here twice, Secretary Raimondo, we had our first CODEL, a congressional delegation, in five years when the Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of the Senate came out with a bipartisan delegation. We hadn't had a governor here in five years until Governor Gavin Newsom came to China on a very long visit in October of last year. So I think President Biden and President Xi agreed, look for all the problems in this relationship, let's keep talking. And I think that has been a byproduct, a positive byproduct in a way, of the Woodside Summit.
And then in addition to that, what's gone perhaps better since Woodside? Well, first we are beginning to have now senior military to military communications that we did not have before. So Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has had a meeting just last month with his Chinese counterpart in Singapore. Our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Brown has had a similar meeting with his counterpart. These are critically important contacts because our militaries are operating in very close proximity to each other and international waters of the Spratlys and Paracels of the South China Sea, and the Senkakus in the East China Sea, and the Taiwan Strait. And you wanna make sure that you've got senior level military contact in case of an accident or misunderstanding. So I think in that respect, we're ahead of the game. We are beginning to make, this is still in the positive side, beginning to make some progress on the fentanyl issue, the Minister of Public Security here, Wang Xiaohong, he has opened the aperture to broader law enforcement cooperation with our Drug Enforcement Agency, with Department of Homeland Security. I think that's a positive.
Third, we've begun a discussion. This is on the positive side of artificial intelligence. It's nascent. We're trying to look at risks associated with AI to our two countries and to the global balance of power. So I think in that respect, certainly as I see it, Jude, here as the American Ambassador talking to the Chinese every day, it's a relatively more transparent and stable relationship. That's the good news. That's point one.
Here is point two. This relationship remains highly competitive, very difficult, often very disputatious. And I certainly feel that as the point person here for the United States. And I just describe it in a couple of ways. We are military rivals, we're rivals for military power in the Indo-Pacific. One of the things that we feel most positive about is that under President Biden's leadership, we have strengthened our alliances with Japan, South Korea, with the Philippines, the development of AUKUS, the development of the Quad at the head of government level. We've strengthened the American position here and we have every intention of maintaining our military power and our military alliance relationships.
But that's a very competitive relationship. Technology I think, Jude, is maybe the heart of the competition between China and the United States. I mean, most people will focus of course on the commercial competition. We're very proud of the leading position that the American tech companies have given our country and artificial intelligence. But that's a big competition. It's gonna certainly last well into the next decade. And there will be military dimensions as we see AI develop, machine learning, biotechnology, quantum mathematics, we're gonna see a new generation of military technology produce and we intend to be in the forefront of that, not as number two, that's an arena of competition.
Trade and investment. China is our third largest trade partner. But I can tell you I meet with American CEOs, I just met with several yesterday here in Beijing. There is no level playing field for them. So part of my job is to try to help level that playing field.
And then finally, on the competitive side, and this is really first in my mind, we believe in human freedom. We believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion and freedom of the press. And we contest, in a battle of ideas, the authoritarian policies of the government of China. And what's happened, I mean the tragedy in Xinjiang, the continued repression in Tibet, the complete transformation unfortunately of Hong Kong. I was there in March and saw it with my own eyes, the lack of freedom in Hong Kong. This is a very competitive relationship and I think in a way we're looking at a structural competition, it's gonna continue into the next decade.
We need to keep it peaceful. We need to drive down the probability of conflict, but we need to compete. And so that would be my main answer. Yes, we've had, I think, achieved something important, greater communication because of the Woodside Summit, credit President Biden with that in his talks with President Xi. But we Americans need to compete with China to protect our national interests on all these issues. And that's what really animates the work of myself and my great colleagues here in China, my American colleagues.
Mr. Blanchette: Thank you, that was a really helpful perspective, Ambassador Burns. And of course, I'm always struck by its obvious ways in which trying to find a modus vivendi with Beijing is challenging. And I think sometimes there can be armchair sniping that these efforts are a waste of time. But I always try to ask people to imagine what the world looks like in which the United States is not trying its best to win the competition, but keep it peaceful and to try to make these efforts to engage with the Chinese. That is a much more worrying world to me. So I appreciate the efforts of you and all your colleagues to stand up for U.S. interest, but also try to manage this at the same time.
Amb. Burns: Thanks Jude. I just want to add one more point just based on what you just said. In addition to the competition, we do have an opportunity to work I would say productively with China on climate change. And John Podesta, who's our new climate negotiator, has started a productive working relationship with Liu Zhenmin, who's the new Chinese climate negotiator. You know, we're the two largest carbon emitters. China's way ahead of us. It's the largest by far, but we have a responsibility to both of our countries and of the world to work on that. I think fentanyl's another area we have gotta work together.
So it's a largely competitive relationship. The great majority of my time is spent competing, disagreeing, pushing, you know, in this relationship. But we do have this engagement side that I think, you know, for Americans to understand, is an important part of why we need to work with China, why we need to have contact with the Chinese leadership.
Mr. Blanchette: Let me ask you, you'd mentioned the military to military dimension and the restart of some of the, the engagement including at the senior level of the Chinese military and our military. That being said, we saw a recent announcement by the Chinese that they were going to tap the brakes on some of the arms control non-proliferation talks. And the proximate reason Beijing gave was arm sales to Taiwan. And just as my own editorial input here, I will say that I have felt very recently the government and some of the people I engage with in the government trying to redefine arm sales as being quote unquote controversial. And my response to them is, I don't see these as controversial. In some ways this is the most banal element of U.S. support for Taiwan as mandated by the Taiwan Relations Act.
But how do you interpret Beijing's announcement of, obviously, I'm sure this is deeply frustrating for you, but is this really about Taiwan armed sales? If it is, why now, given the fact that the United States has been consistently selling arms of a defensive nature to Taiwan as consistent with the TRA, and really what is Beijing trying to achieve here by walking away from what I think we can all see is important ways of managing the competition and keeping it peaceful?
Amb. Burns: This is a very serious mistake by the Chinese leadership to suspend our talks on arms control and nuclear non-proliferation. The two leaders agreed in San Francisco at the Woodside Summit that we would begin, renew this conversation. It's important for the two strongest military powers in the world to be talking about arms control, to be talking about trying to stem the proliferation of nuclear technologies in the world. And the Chinese should not be surprised that we're selling defensive military technology to Taiwan. The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 commands the United States to do that. Every administration has done that. So that cannot be a legitimate excuse. I think what the Chinese leadership owes the rest of the world is much greater transparency about their dramatic buildup of nuclear weapons. The Defense Department released as you know, Jude, last autumn, the autumn of 2023, an unclassified report on the buildup of Chinese nuclear weapons force.
It's really unprecedented in the world today. And what has been a hallmark of the old Cold War diplomacy beginning in 1963 with the Test Ban Treaty after the Cuban Missile Crisis, nuclear weapons powers agree to be transparent. The United States is very transparent about our nuclear weapons program and China is not. And the fact now that they won't even talk to our government about this is not only disappointing, I think it's irresponsible. So I think the Chinese government here will feel a lot of pressure from countries around the world and not just treaty allies of the United States, from countries in the Global South. You know, you do owe the rest of the world some insights into what you're planning and how you're gonna conduct yourself in this nuclear realm. And so we hope they'll come back to the table. That was the commitment they made to us. And the excuse they're making now doesn't stand up in international court of public opinion.
Mr. Blanchette: If I can ask just a follow up on that, given that they have directly linked this to defense technology going to Taiwan, which as you mentioned is mandated by the TRA and we've been doing consistently for, you know, more than four decades, is it your sense that they're just not interested in this anymore? Because of course we will continue to supply Taiwan with arms of a defensive nature. So if this is a gambit to get the United States to withhold aid, I don't imagine that that's remotely possible. So they must know that. So is this just for them to find an excuse to walk away from these?
Amb. Burns: It does sound like an excuse to me because as you say, we are gonna continue to supply defense technology to Taiwan. We've been doing it for 45 years and we're gonna continue it under our One China policy.
But on the other hand, we do need to have a serious strategic discussion with the Chinese about arms control and about what they are doing in the buildup of the nuclear weapons forces. It seems like an excuse. They clearly want to continue to develop their nuclear weapons force and to reach maybe parity, maybe that's their goal in the next decade. But we are a responsible steward, the United States, of our nuclear weapons and of our nuclear technology. We believe the rest of the world needs to understand what we are doing and China should be held to the same standard.
Mr. Blanchette: I know I only have you for a few more minutes here, so if I can just try to get a few final questions in. It's the start of your day, the end of mine, so I want to be respectful of that.
There's a lot of discussion and very open discussion about what is America's China policy. The Communist Party in Beijing does not go around having open discussions about their America policy, but I figure you better than anyone would be in a position to summarize what you think the key planks of Beijing's America or U.S. policy are.
Amb. Burns: Well, I think it's a really interesting question, Jude, because I think there's a contradiction between what their stated policy is to the United States versus their actual policy.
The stated policy, if you look at the speeches of their, their ambassador in Washington, Xie Feng, or others is, hey, we can have a win-win relationship with the United States. We should be friends, we should trade, we should have more tourism, et cetera, et cetera. It sounds good, but it belies the reality. I think the reality of their policy is the leadership here made a calculation that the United States was a waning power, say 2017, ‘18, ‘19, ’20, ‘21. I remember being asked about this when I was talking to senators to be confirmed that Xi Jinping had said the East is rising and the West is falling. That calculation of the Chinese leadership did not turn out to be accurate. And I think the Chinese have been surprised, maybe even shocked by the resurgence in the American economy to the substantial strengthening of our alliances out here, U.S. alliances in the Indo-Pacific.
So their real policy is to counter the United States, it's to compete with the United States. They're trying to, in the way that they're building up the People's Liberation Army, both their rocket forces, their naval technology, they're trying to push the United States out beyond the first island chain over the long term here in the Pacific. They're trying to become the strongest military power eventually in the Indo-Pacific. They're certainly trying to divide the United States from its traditional allies. You see this huge charm offensive underway from Beijing to our European allies. It's not working because the big issue in Europe of course is Putin's war of aggression against Ukraine. And I think the Europeans see what we're seeing, that China is aiding and abetting the Russian war machine, the Russian defense industrial base, helping Putin. So that hasn't worked. And the Chinese are also doing something else which is a little bit more insidious, maybe not as visible to most people, not in the front page of The New York Times.
They've developed the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, the Global Civilization Initiative. This is an attempt over the long term to erode the values of our world order and to take on the primacy that we give to human rights, for instance, and to the rule of law in the United Nations system. And to make that international order in Chinese eyes more friendly to authoritarianism. We obviously resist this. For us, it's a major strategic issue to defend the liberal, small L liberal, basis of the world order that we and our allies have built up since the close of the Second World War.
So if you put all this together, the actual policy of China against the United States, it's very aggressive, it's confrontational in many ways, it's very competitive, and that's why we are where we are in this relationship. You know, sometimes the Chinese complain to me, the Chinese leadership, you know, why are you building up your military power in the Indo-Pacific? And my response is, you're contesting the sovereignty of the Philippines and of Vietnam. You've been unfriendly towards Japan and South Korea. You're contesting Indian sovereignty in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh and the Himalayas. These are all allies and friends of the United States. There has been a reaction.
And we've seen, Jude, this extraordinary turnaround in the Philippines, since President Marcos came in, reasserting the primacy of the U.S.-Philippine Mutual Defense Agreement of 1951. You've seen the Japanese say that they're gonna spend 2% of GDP now in defense, the acquirement of long-range strike weapons by Japan. This is all part of a reaction by the United States and its allies to an overly aggressive China in this region.
So I guess I'd turn the tables. I think there's the declared rhetorical policy of China towards the United States, but it's belied by the assertiveness of China against the United States and many of our most important interests.
Mr. Blanchette: Yeah, and it strikes me that either the largest blind spot, or it's an example of willful ignorance, or it's just an inability to read the room, is Beijing’s inability to understand the action reaction dynamic of their aggression and how that reverberates through the region and creates countervailing forces that boomerang back into Beijing's face.
And of course, they like to frame this as if this is all the United States stirring the pot, which is an easier explanation for them. But I think again, that just means that they deny agency to all the countries that are on its periphery.
Amb. Burns: Right.
Mr. Blanchette: So let me ask you just a final two questions, Ambassador Burns, and I'll let you go.
And you had just mentioned the Chinese view of the East is rising, West is declining and, and how they've been caught on their heels with a – whether this is a strengthening of U.S. ally partnerships, whether this is the rebound of the U.S. economy.
Here in the United States, we've had over the last couple years a debate about China's own trajectory and at the outer margins of this, there are those who I think see China as the development curve really going into a vertical, you know, nose dive. And this is under the Peak China rubric that China, its best days are behind it and the downward steepness of the curve indicating that, you know, China has maybe not collapsed, but something akin to that in the next decade or so.
Where do you come down on your own view of China's development trajectory, political trajectory? Do you buy into the Peak China debate? Do you have a different framework for thinking about where China will be in 10 to 15 years?
Amb. Burns: Well, I've followed our academic debate back home with great interests. Peak China, been reading all the articles. I'd say the following: number one, there's no question that China is facing a much broader set of economic challenges than that they had anticipated just a couple of years ago. They're looking at, certainly in the next several years towards the end of this decade, much lower GDP growth rate per year. That's gonna be a problem. They have a demographic challenge. They still haven't really figured out how to respond to this seismic property crisis that has really been a major problem for middle class Chinese here.
So lots of problems here and yet I think it would be a mistake to exaggerate those problems and to underestimate the strength of China. It remains the world's leading manufacturer, the world's leading exporter. Through BRI, and I've been a very strong critic of BRI, as have other members of our government, it has given China global reach. If you think about the Chinese economic presence in South America, in all of Sub-Saharan Africa, in Central Asia, in South Asia, and Southeast Asia, China has a strong and willful government strategically oriented to try to continue to build Chinese influence around the world. I think it would be a mistake for us to assume that China is on a permanent downward path given all those inherent strengths in the Chinese economy. That's the first point.
The second point is I like the chances of the United States to retain our position as the strongest global power. Our alliance system, and I see this so clearly in working with the Japanese here, here in Beijing, with the South Koreans, with the Australians, with the Indians. We are in an exceptionally strong position and China does not have anything like the American alliances here in the Indo-Pacific.
I'm also, Jude, a former ambassador to NATO. And it's remarkable for me to see the sense that NATO and the EU now have a strategic policy on China because of Chinese support for Russia in the Ukraine war. There's been a furious reaction against China by the European powers. And you see many more members, by the way, of the Bundestag, of the French National Assembly, of the European Parliament, traveling to Taiwan, much like our members of Congress, than to Beijing. And so I do think that Chinese have been shocked in a way by the fact that Europe is reacting strategically as well as the East Asian Indo-Pacific allies of the United States. I like our position strategically, I think we've strengthened it here in the Biden Administration and look at the recovery of the American economy after COVID. This extraordinary job growth we've had, the stock market, the strength and lead we have in AI technology because of our tech companies.
You know, I tell the Chinese, don't discount the United States. They often look at us. I read the China Daily every day. It's amazing to me, there are four or five editorials every single day making hay, you know about guns, about problems in urban America. Looking at our disputatious politics, and the red blue divide, and saying the Americans are in shambles. I keep telling Chinese in conversations, don't misunderstand us. We're a strong country. American democracy is gonna survive and move forward. We're gonna come out of any crisis that we have because we've proven it over time. And I think that they would be sadly mistaken to think that we're on a downward slope in our history. I, I think America has a lot of strengths in the time ahead.
So as I think about Peak China, don't underestimate China. That'd be a big mistake, both their strength and their will. But bet on an outward looking America that continues to value our alliances. It's a force multiplier for the United States and we need to make sure that we are committed to those allies. And as long as we do that and stay strong ourselves with a strong American military, specifically out here in the Indo-Pacific, our Navy, our Air Force, I think the United States is gonna prevail in this long-term struggle for power.
Mr. Blanchette: I think that counts as about an optimistic a note as you can end a discussion on U.S.-China relations, Ambassador Burns. And I just wanna say I'm also happy you made that point. It was a discussion I was having with someone who, you know, earlier today where I was saying I think we've lost sight of the fact that if you're thinking about the balance of power and you're thinking about in the strategic competition who's winning, I think it's inarguable that we are. Now, that doesn't mean our lead is permanent, it doesn't mean we sit down on the racetrack, doesn't mean we stop thinking about our innovative capacity. I mean this is a constant process, but in the attempt to raise awareness about the China challenge, we can get into a position where we inflate China's capabilities and almost downplay the extraordinary strengths the United States has. Whether it's innovative capacity alliances and partnerships, our university system. I'll take our leadership of our State Department and our military over the PLA and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs any day.
Amb. Burns: Me too.
Mr. Blanchette: So I just really appreciate your point. I think we need to begin just normalizing the fact that the United States is leading in this competition and double down on the areas where we excel at, address the weaknesses that are very real and there, but never lose sight of how manifestly well-positioned the U.S. is in this long-term competition.
Amb. Burns: Jude, I agree. And if I could say one more thing just to kind of unite this conversation, I think that's a very important point. It's not pollyannaish to say that America has a really strong future out here in the Indo-Pacific. It's based on reality and we've just gotta keep, maintain our military strength, we've gotta maintain our diplomatic strength, and our alliances. That's the force multiplier. That's the difference between China, which has no allies, and the United States, which has this really strong group of allies.
I'd say one more thing. We need to stay engaged. We're gonna have to compete with China, and that's gonna be the focal point of our diplomacy. That's what my life and my mission is here, compete with China. At the same time, we can't demonize the Chinese people. We shouldn't. It's gonna be very important as we have a competitive, difficult relationship with the government of China to keep our populations connected.
So I wanna see more American students in China. More than the 800 we have now, down from 15,000, 10 years ago. More tourists, more business travelers. Why? Because you need ballast in the relationship and you need the societies to remain connected because that's a strength of the United States. That's part of our soft power. If you expose a young person in China to the free flow of information, to the debates that we have about our own future in the United States, that's a strong point about America, not a weak point. And so I think as we compete, stay connected on a societal basis, we want the next generation of Jude Blanchettes, China specialists –
Mr. Blanchette: (Laughs.)
 – You know, to take my place and to take the place of my colleagues in the 2030s and 2040s to sustain this relationship. Because while we compete, we do have to live in peace with China. We cannot allow ourselves to get close, either country, to a military conflict, which would be catastrophic for all of us.
And so that is a big, big set of challenges, but I think we're positioned to conduct this diplomacy in a strategic and effective way. So thank you for letting me sound off a little bit today about some of these issues.
Mr. Blanchette: I appreciate it, Ambassador Burns.
The only thing I would try to correct you on is I hope the next generation of China Scholars is vastly superior to the Jude Blanchettes of the world.
Amb. Burns: (Laughs.)
Mr. Blanchette: But thank you very much for your leadership out there. Those of us back here in the United States understand how trying and challenging the triangulation that you and the Biden Administration are trying to achieve of positioning the United States for success in a competition with China while keeping it peaceful. I'm sure it feels like that line to walk is even narrower over there than it appears over here.
So thank you for your leadership on this and not nearly as important. But thank you for your time this morning. Genuinely appreciated.
Amb. Burns: Jude, it's an honor to serve here as the American Ambassador and to serve with great public servants, men and women here in our mission. And I hope we produce more Jude Blanchettes in the next generation too. So (laughs) I'll insist on that point.
Thank you so much, Jude.
Mr. Blanchette: Thank you, Ambassador Burns.

32,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/hasan-alhasan-strategies-gulf-states,Unknown,"July 23, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS podcast published on July 23, 2024. Listen to the podcast here.
Jon Alterman: Hasan Alhasan, welcome to Babel. 
Hasan Alhasan: Thank you very much.
Jon Alterman: Around the world, there's a war in Ukraine, U.S.-Chinese competition, and a war in Gaza. You're sitting in the Gulf. What does it look like is going on around the world? 
Hasan Alhasan: It's a very dangerous world. There is tremendous upheaval, as you describe it. The geopolitical situation in the region looks extremely turbulent, but obviously, it's not much better in Europe at the moment. 
Global geoeconomics also look quite turbulent; you've got an ongoing trade war that could get even worse if Trump gets reelected. This can have all kinds of repercussions for the Gulf region, but in addition, there is a tremendous amount of opportunity that Gulf leaders seem to perceive in this changing geopolitical and geoeconomic context. It opens up opportunities for the Gulf states to play various roles that had been closed to them in the past.
For example, you see the Saudis and the Emiratis trying to mediate various prisoner exchanges between the Russians and the Ukrainians. That's not a role that you would normally conceive of for the Gulf states, but there they are. They see this not only as a perilous environment, but also one that offers several opportunities. 
Jon Alterman: So how would you differentiate the different approaches of Gulf states? What are the similarities? You mentioned the Saudis and the Emiratis talking about prisoner exchanges, but what are the differences in how Gulf states perceive the world and how they act?
Hasan Alhasan: I tend to think that the similarities are greater than the differences. If you look at the crux of their foreign policies, their threat perceptions, and their national security strategies, I see more similarities than differences. They are all U.S. strategic partners. They rely on the presence of foreign powers, the United States first and foremost, to protect and safeguard their national interests. They perceive Iran to varying degrees as the source of a potential threat. They are open economies. They are oil exporters; they are gas exporters.
The similarities that bring them together are greater than the differences that set them apart, but obviously, there are significant differences. Historically, their relationships with the Muslim Brotherhood have been quite different. Their relationships with regional powers, such as Turkey and Iran, have also been different, at least on the tactical level as far as Iran is concerned. You have countries like Oman, Qatar, and even Kuwait to some extent, that have traditionally been more willing to engage with Iran. They see that as being a more effective means of managing that large and potentially threatening neighbor. But you see differences in their relationships with Turkey. For example, Qatar clearly has a very strong relationship with Turkey. That aligns, more or less, with the fact that Qatar tends to be more permissive and open to the Muslim Brotherhood, at least on the regional level, not within Qatar's domestic polity. 
So, in a sense, you do see these differences and they can be significant. They have been very significant over the past decade, especially with the Arab Spring, which was a period characterized by rivalries and competition over who gets to exert more influence within the region and who gets to shape geopolitical outcomes.
Jon Alterman: It also seems to me that their approaches to China have been different. Saudi Arabia seemed to be much more interested in getting closer to China, then it became much less interested in getting closer to China. We've seen the United Arab Emirates seeming to get closer to China and then striking this deal on AI that seems to align it more closely with the United States. How do countries differentiate a future relationship with the United States and a future relationship with China? 
Hasan Alhasan: What brings all the Gulf states together is a realization that you can't really choose between any of these two partners. There are strategic security interests with the United States. There are major economic interests with China, which ultimately is their largest oil market and their largest economic partner in terms of trade. Also, regarding Russia, there's obviously a common interest in managing the oil markets.
There is commonality in not wanting to choose. None of the Gulf states have chosen to enforce Western sanctions against Russia precisely because they share this realization. Beyond that, their appetites and their room for maneuvering and engaging with China—and even Russia—differ quite significantly. In the past, until rather recently, the UAE had clearly taken the lead in establishing and positioning itself as China's most significant interlocutor in the Gulf, but Saudi Arabia has really grown a much bigger appetite for engaging with China. You see that happening at the scientific, technological, economic levels, but also increasingly in defense. 
You see it increasingly with Bahrain as well, which recently struck a strategic partnership agreement with China, even though Bahrain was perhaps the slowest of the Gulf countries to really build a relationship with China. Oman also has an interest. It's the only Gulf state to have received soft loans from China to support its budget, and it relies massively on the Chinese market for oil exports. But the pace of diplomatic relations varies somewhat with Kuwait and Qatar being slower to build a more robust relationship with the Chinese. 
Jon Alterman: How much fear is there that a relationship with China in certain fields will undermine the relationship with the United States? How much expectation is there that China will fill some of the gaps that a less intimate relationship with the United States would create? Is there fear that gap would be wider because China simply won't do what the United States can do and has been willing to do?
Hasan Alhasan: It is a complex dynamic, and I don't think the Gulf states see it as a very clean trade-off. China has acted opportunistically and so have the Gulf states. For example, the Gulf states wanted armed UAVs or drones from the United States. When they couldn't get them, they turned to the Chinese but also to others like the Turks. The Gulf states are going to get however much they can get from whoever they can get it from. If they really want something, whether it's a piece of military hardware or assistance on AI or semiconductors, they have proved to be very dogged and pragmatic in their resolve. 
The United States has tried to impose certain trade-offs by conditioning access to certain emerging and disruptive technologies deemed critical to U.S. national security if Gulf states don’t curtail relations with China in those fields. I think the Gulf states have successfully pushed back against U.S. pressure when it comes to Huawei and 5G telecommunications infrastructure.
Jon Alterman: Although the United States was concerned about Huawei. It interrupted the F-35 sale to the UAE, and there still hasn't been an F-35 sale to the UAE. 
Hasan Alhasan: That tells you quite a bit about UAE decision-making and why the UAE decided to press ahead with Huawei despite the risk of foregoing the F-35 deal. That's part of the pushback against the zero-sum equation that the United States is trying to impose. In certain areas like AI where the United States continues to have an advantage over China, I think you'll see the Emiratis pragmatically decide to align with the United States. The Saudis have been somewhat more on the defensive. I wouldn't be surprised to see a two-system approach where sovereign wealth funds or state-owned enterprises align with the United States, whereas education institutions might seek cooperation with the Chinese. You might really start seeing this kind of behavior to try and maximize the benefits of engaging with both parties. 
Jon Alterman: We've seen a call in the Gulf to have formal written agreements with the United States on defense issues without an accompanying commitment that, in a world that seems to be bifurcating, the Gulf states cast their lot firmly with the United States. Is there concern that this idea, what you might call “positive neutrality,” will become unsustainable in an increasingly divided world? 
Hasan Alhasan: That's a great question, but it's really a matter of perspective. I think the Gulf states see it rather differently. They see a credible threat of edging closer to China as constituting useful bargaining leverage vis-à-vis the United States. The United States would not be as interested in deepening its defense and security commitment to Gulf states unless it thought that failing to do so would impact their appetites for engaging with China. 
The United States has been rather vocal in its concerns about the potential Chinese military footprint in the Gulf, including in Abu Dhabi or even in Oman. The Gulf states are somewhat dexterous at using those concerns. If the United States doesn't formalize its commitment, then the Gulf states will find different ways of achieving what their trying to do. They see this as a point of leverage, but it's a very delicate balance. If they go too far with China in certain domains, the risk is that it could backfire and end up undermining the U.S. security commitment.
Jon Alterman: We've talked about China, and we've mentioned Russia, but we haven't mentioned a country you know a lot about: India. Are we underestimating the future role of India? People talk about India as a strong middle power becoming—as some Indians see it—a weak Great Power. India's involvement in the Gulf has been growing. As we think about the geopolitics of the Gulf, do we need to pay more attention to the changing role of India?
Hasan Alhasan: If anything, there's been a degree of overexcitement in Washington about the potential role that India could play in the Middle East and the Western Indian Ocean. The idea that the United States could create a network knitting together partners in the Indian Ocean with partners in the Middle East. We've seen that manifest itself in I2U2, which brings together India, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States. We’ve also seen it with IMEC, or the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, which is supposed to be this multimodal transport and trade corridor linking India to Europe through the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Israel. Betting on a larger role for India has been somewhat of a hallmark of this present administration's approach to the Middle East.
At this point in time, India has little to offer. India doesn't have really much capital to put on the table; it’s looking to attract investments from the Gulf. It doesn't yet have the willingness to be a full security partner for the United States in the region. Yes, it's become an observer of the Combined Maritime Forces, but it's not a fully participating member. That partially has to do with the fact that India doesn't like to follow the United States’ lead when it comes to security and defense constructs in the Indian Ocean, but it is also because of Pakistan's membership in the Combined Maritime Forces.
Beyond that, India's foreign policy in the region has not evolved to such an extent. It doesn't have the toolkit to be an influential player that could shape geopolitical outcomes in a way consistent with U.S. foreign policy, or even in a way that makes a significant difference to the region—not just yet at least. 
Jon Alterman: You certainly have India-China tensions, and India might see the Gulf as a way to address some of its challenges and competition with China. Could that impact the situation in the Gulf, or do they really have too few tools to be impactful? 
Hasan Alhasan: I do think India is concerned about China's growing influence in the Gulf. They tend to see it within the framework of a so-called “string of pearls” policy. The idea that China could end up encircling India and the Indian Ocean by building ports and dual-use infrastructure that it could weaponize in times of war. They see Chinese investments in ports like Duqm, the UAE, and potentially even in Iran. Meanwhile, the Iranians seem to be playing hardball with the Indians on Chabahar port, which is a port that the Indians were supposed to be developing for over two decades, but they faced obstacles partly due to U.S. sanctions. The Iranians played hardball at some point by threatening to bring in the Chinese on various contracts, and that spooked the Indians.
India does have a great deal of concern about what they perceive to be China's growing influence in the region. Now, I do think India's concerns are also exaggerated, because I don't think China can force a geopolitical outcome in the region that countries in the region did not want in the first place. China doesn't have that kind of leverage over the Gulf states. However, I don't think that India is willing or able to expand a lot of diplomatic capital—nor do I think is it able to do anything—to stem China's growing influence in the Gulf region at this point.
Jon Alterman: I also wonder about China's willingness to expend diplomatic capital. We certainly haven't seen China play a very active role in Red Sea security. Not only does so much Chinese trade passes through the Red Sea, but also, China made a large investment in Egypt and Suez Canal tolls are down 57 percent since January. We haven't seen Chinese diplomacy on Gaza be meaningful at all. It seems that China has been remarkably passive on the issues that are most important to Gulf states. Does that have an impact? 
Hasan Alhasan: I think it does. I don't think the Gulf states are expecting or would even want China to play a game-changing role in Middle Eastern geopolitics. I don't think they trust China enough yet for it to play a much larger security role or to evolve into the kind of strategic partner that the United States is. But I think they do see China as a marginal, useful, and opportunistic player. 
If the Saudis can get China to broker a deal to restore diplomatic relations with Iran, then fantastic, because clearly the United States is either unwilling or unable to do so. If the Saudis and Emiratis can attract Chinese investments into their oil and critical infrastructure and, by doing so, give the Chinese a vested interest in Saudi and Emirati stability and restrain Iran, then that's all the better. If China can act as a useful diplomatic partner in the UN Security Council and vote in a certain way on the Palestinian issue, then that's also great. The point is that it's very opportunistic. I don't think there is a great deal of expectation being placed by the Gulf states on the kind of diplomatic or security role that the Chinese can play. The limits of China's appetite are clear to everyone in the region. 
Jon Alterman: Until about a year ago, every time I went to the Gulf, people would tell me, “The United States is on its way out the door. The United States is abandoning us. The United States has lost its interest in the Gulf.” Since October 7th, I haven't heard that at all. We've seen Operation Prosperity Guardian in the Red Sea as a sign of U.S. willingness to fight on behalf of global security issues in the Middle East. What happened to the concern about a U.S. withdrawal? What are people's assessments about U.S. commitment to the region, and how is the region responding as a consequence of what we've seen for the last nine months? 
Hasan Alhasan: Pre-October 7th, I largely agree with you. There's been a series of disappointments in the Gulf regarding the extent of the U.S. security commitment. Not necessarily the level of troops or military equipment that it maintains in the region, because that hasn't changed tremendously, but rather, the extent of what the United States is willing to do with the firepower that it has amassed in the region. There are two important watershed moments of late: the 2019 Iranian attacks on the Saudi Aramco oil facilities and the Houthi attacks on Abu Dhabi. The lukewarm U.S. response, the United States’ unwillingness to use military power to respond, was seen with a large degree of disappointment. 
That was an important moment that prompted Gulf states to rethink their approaches to managing regional threats. This disappointment is partly responsible for the de-escalation we saw between the Gulf states and their regional rivals, such as the resolution of the crisis with Qatar and the repairing of relations with Turkey and even Iran. 
Now, there is no doubt in anyone's mind in the region that the United States is willing to use firepower and military power, and that it is willing to fight on behalf of Israel. I think this is how the United States’ intervention in the Red Sea is being perceived. It's also partly the reason why none of the Arab States, none of the Gulf states, no Muslim-majority country, with the sole exception of Bahrain, decided to participate in Operation Prosperity Guardian or support the U.S.-led attacks on the Houthis in Yemen. These are perceived squarely as being on behalf of Israel. 
The Israel-Hamas war has, I think, set the U.S.-GCC strategic partnership on a more equal footing. In the past, the risk of entanglement was always perceived by Washington. Washington had always been reticent and hesitant to upgrade its defense and security commitment to the Gulf states for fear that the Gulf states would prove to be reckless vis-à-vis Iran and could end up dragging the United States into a war with Iran. That perception is now being reversed. The Gulf states see the United States as being hostage to Israeli decision-making, which has proved very reckless over the past few months. Ultimately, it's Israel through the United States that could end up dragging the Gulf states into a war with Iran that they do not want. 
That explains why the Gulf states have chosen to preserve these diplomatic relations and have chosen to protect the de-escalatory dynamic with Iran. It's part of the reason why the Gulf states chose not to put on an offensive posture by lending their support to Operation Prosperity Guardian or to the U.S.-led strikes against the Houthis. It also explains why there's been a degree of reporting about the UAE restricting the use of their territory and airspace to the United States to prevent the United States from using their territory to launch attacks against the Houthis in Yemen or even against targets in Iraq. It also explains why the Gulf states have been asking the United States not to use Gulf-based bases or airspace to launch attacks against Iran.
There is a realization now that after years of concern of U.S. abandonment, the relationship is now on a more equal footing. The United States needs its partnerships and relationships with the Gulf states, partly to deter Iran and to preserve Israel's security. These relationships have proved extremely important in allowing and enabling the United States to blunt Iran's attacks against Israel. There aren't many other partners that can offer the United States the same amount of room for maneuvering and the safe space to operate as the Gulf states in the Middle East region. This is a highly contested region, so I think there is this really interesting realization and reshaping of the dynamic coming out of the current war between Israel and Hamas. 
Jon Alterman: As you note, regional states helped defend Israel against an Iranian attack in April. No country that's been part of the Abraham Accords has walked away from that. There seems to be an expectation that relations with Israel will pick up, and I think a similar expectation that relations with Iran will be sustained. It feels like the Gulf is trying to have it both ways by sustaining relations with Iran and growing relations with Israel, while also sustaining relations with the United States and growing relations with China. What are the trade-offs of trying to have it both ways? 
Hasan Alhasan: Yes, I think the Gulf states are trying to have their cake and eat it at the same time. They do this by maintaining a rather delicate balance on certain issues. For example, you mentioned what the Gulf states have done by way of intercepting Houthi UAVs and Houthi missiles, but also by assisting the United States in intercepting the direct attack launched by Iran on Israel. I think the Gulf states would say that they are adopting a purely defensive posture. They're intercepting projectiles that are crossing over their territories, and they're not really presenting a threat to Iran.
The Iranians seem to accept this as a compromise that they're willing to live with. By threading the needle, the Gulf states are trying to manage the trade-offs of having good relations with Israel and with Iran at the same time.
This was the thrust of Gulf foreign policy prior to October 7th. You had the Emiratis and the Saudis talking about the shared prosperity agenda, which is this old idea that through economic interconnections, such as investments in connectivity, infrastructure, and trade, the interests of all the different countries in the region can be intertwined. This could have a peace-inducing effect. The war now is seen as somewhat of a spoiler, but not necessarily as a total game-changer for the Gulf states. 
Saudi Arabia obviously sees an opportunity. They see themselves as having greater leverage to negotiate a binding U.S. defense commitment in exchange for the normalization of relations with Israel. They know that the Saudi normalization agreement with Israel is part of the off-ramp strategy that the Biden administration is trying to construct for Benjamin Netanyahu to say, “If you end the war, that there would be an upside of establishing a diplomatic relationship with Saudi Arabia.”
The Saudis know this, and they know that President Biden is pressed for time. He's obviously facing a looming election, and so they see this as an opportunity to get a deeper defense commitment from the United States. Ultimately, the Gulf states are still interested in sustaining all these relationships. They manage these trade-offs by walking various fine lines and striking delicate balances. Sometimes, these balances can go wrong, but at the moment, their strategies are paying off. However, they have to be more realistic about the pace at which they will be able to deepen their relationship with Israel. Grand connectivity projects are likely to become much less achievable, and I think the Gulf states know this. 
Jon Alterman: Threading the needle is one thing with the Biden administration. It could be something very different with the Trump administration. One of the problems that all the Gulf states have is that there can be profound changes in U.S. strategy every four or eight years. Will the way the Gulf states are threading the needle now likely suffice in a Trump administration, which may have much less tolerance for balance and may be much more aggressive about Iran's regional role? How do the Gulf states think about their necessary agility if the U.S. political context changes dramatically?
Hasan Alhasan: This is a strategic dilemma for the Gulf states, probably one of their greatest strategic challenges. Their single most important strategic security partner, the United States, is liable to change its mind about how to approach Iran every four years or so. You went from a potential grand bargain under President Obama to maximum pressure under President Trump, and back to a more limited arms control approach under President Biden. Arguably, Iran has been the most volatile foreign policy issue for the United States.
The Gulf states initially approached this by voicing their discontent with U.S. policy. As you might recall during the Obama administration, the Gulf states were really trying to influence the discussion in vain by trying to prioritize the issues of Iran's regional proxy network over the issue of constraining Iran's nuclear program. I think they failed rather dramatically in moving the U.S. needle on this issue under the Obama administration. 
The main lesson learned by the Gulf states is that they need an insurance policy. You take out an insurance policy by building a direct relationship with Iran, partly because U.S. deterrence efforts vis-à-vis Iran have not been extremely successful below a certain threshold. The Iranians have been getting away with having partner and proxy groups in Iraq and Syria launch attacks on U.S. forces without incurring a serious U.S. military response. I recall a testimony by the CENTCOM commander where he said that there had been north of 70 attacks launched on U.S. service members in Iraq and Syria, and only on three or four occasions, if I'm not misquoting him, the United States responded. 
There was a perception of U.S. deterrence failure vis-à-vis Iran, and there was a maturing of Gulf foreign policy on Iran. Even the Saudis, the Bahrainis, and everyone else realized the need to engage Iran diplomatically. Also, they realized the need to bring new partners into the fold like China and Russia, even when no one else in the Western world would engage with Russia because of the invasion of Ukraine. They could use those relationships to constrain Russian and Chinese relations with Iran and attempt to build a degree of restraint. Really, it is managing this instability and volatility in U.S. policy. 
I think we're potentially going to see more volatility with the Trump administration. It's very difficult to predict what the Trump policy on Iran is going to look like. I think the main lesson learned for the Gulf states is that they manage volatility by taking offsetting positions, by taking out an insurance policy, by building a direct relationship with the Iranians, and by building relations with Iran's main allies and benefactors, namely the Chinese and the Russians. This is how, by and large, the Gulf states have approached what has been one of their largest strategic challenges. 
Jon Alterman: Hasan Alhasan, thank you very much for joining us on Babel. 
Hasan Alhasan: Thank you for having me.

Gregory C. Allen: Good afternoon. I’m Gregory Allen, the director of the CSIS Wadhwani Center for AI and Advanced Technologies.
Today we have a great event about DOD’s efforts to scale the adoption and innovation of AI and other digital technologies. And we’re joined by the perfect person to talk about these issues, Dr. Radha Plumb, the chief digital and artificial intelligence officer for the Department of Defense. Dr. Plumb, thank you so much for joining me today.
Radha Plumb: Thank you so much for having me.
Mr. Allen: We’re going to cover a ton of ground about what’s going on in the DOD AI ecosystem, but before we do that, I want to talk a little bit about you and how you came to work at the intersection of national security, digital technology, and AI.
Dr. Plumb: Well, thank you, and again, thank you for having me.
You know, my background and sort of my body and history of work has largely been focused on how you get data-driven decision making into this national security space. So, my academic work had really focused on taking data applications and applied statistics and trying to use that to inform policy decisions. And then, you know, my work in the private sector was really looking at how you could take that data and help it drive both sort of different decisions and approaches within companies, and then optimizing their business solutions.
So, when I came into the department in 2021 with the deputy secretary, a big agenda item she had was really focused on modernization and driving that innovation ecosystem, and a big piece of work on that peak front was really on how you drive data – modern data practices inside the Department of Defense – so data-driven decision making, there was an early work on data decrees, as well as how you get through a digital and AI innovation into the department. And so that’s really how I came to get here.
Mirroring along with that, though, I’ll just say, is I – just before this role – was serving as the deputy secretary in Acquisition and Sustainment, and a lot of times our focus on digital solutions is on the technology – cool technology pieces, which are cool, and I’m happy to talk about them – but I think a lot of the work on the government side is really on getting those acquisition solutions to help bridge those technologies into the department. And so I think the marrying of the two digital and data background plus acquisition background has been really helpful as I’ve launched into this role.
Mr. Allen: Yeah, so you’ve got an interesting mix of academic, private sector, and national security background, and then also seeing some of the trouble spots for AI adoption in the acquisition ecosystem or in other parts of the ecosystem, so really a natural fit for your current role and we’re – great to see you here.
So you’re only the second leader of the CDAO organization, which was established only two years ago, so relatively still a very young organization. But in some sense, we’re actually pretty far into the DOD AI story. It has been almost 10 years since former deputy secretary of defense, Robert Work, introduced the Third Offset, which was a strategy that had AI and autonomous systems at its heart. That led to, among other things, Project Maven being launched in 2017, which was a flagship AI adoption effort. And so I want to get your sense in terms of the context. Where are we in the story of DOD AI and where are we headed?
Dr. Plumb: Yeah. So I think – let me cut to the end but then take a step back. I think the good news for DOD AI is we have really strong technical foundations and we have proven out now over the last year and a half an experimentation-based approach that allows us to rapidly accelerate technology solutions into fielded capabilities. But before I kind of dive in on that narrative let me just take a step back to say what is the department’s approach to AI. Our approach really comes from three pieces that I think it’s worth keeping in mind.
The first is that, fundamentally, the engine of ideas and innovation is going to be in the private sector. The pointy end of the spear on this AI technology development is coming from private companies, often with commercial or dual-use cases in mind. Second is that federal government investment is great, and I absolutely support it both in the R&D and at the procurement stage. But it really pales in comparison to the private capital investment that exists into digital technologies broadly and AI companies specifically, and I say that to say an apples-to-apples government spending comparison of the U.S. to some of our potential competitors isn’t really the right mechanism to look at that.
The third piece then is to think about, what is the government’s role here in trying to accelerate AI adoption? And I’ll, obviously, focus on the Department of Defense. And that really has three pieces. The data – we need data. AI is a data hungry process, so we need data, and it needs to be ready and usable for AI applications. There’s what I’ll call infrastructure enablement. So that’s – we call it – we’ve labeled this AI scaffolding inside the CDAO, but it really relates to a development environment with the appropriate compute labeled data and then the test and evaluation/ risk management pieces you need.
And then the third is the acquisition pathways to get the commercial technology I said before into the environment I just talked about, right. So that’s really where in CDAO we’re focusing our time and energy is how do we get those three pieces right and that’s what allows us to accelerate adoption. That’s where the strong technical foundation comes in and I’ll just stop filibustering you on this point which is, you know, the strong technical foundation that my predecessor spent the last few years building has been a really critical way for us to jumpstart into this AI environment where there’s a lot of innovation in the private sector, and now our focus is really on scaled infrastructure to enable that and the acquisition pathways needed to bring the technology into that infra.
Mr. Allen: Great. We’re definitely going to talk a lot more about infrastructure, but I also want to sort of say it seems like that’s also part of the answer for what was going to be my next question, which is CDAO is, obviously, the core of the strategy, planning, and a lot of the implementation of DOD’s AI strategy. But they’re not the only people doing important work. There’s stuff going on at each of the military services. There’s stuff going on at DIU. There’s stuff going on at DARPA. So I’d just love to hear your sense about where CDAO fits into the overall picture.
Dr. Plumb: Great, yeah. So I think maybe the way I’d start it is kind of back to those different pieces that I talked about before. On the, you know, coming up and adapting and innovating a lot of that is in the private sector, as I said. But we have some key elements that need to do that and help us think about defense specific applications or priority areas.
We have folks like DARPA and the service labs that are doing a lot of that sort of cutting-edge thinking, through especially military applications. And that’s a really important part of the development piece. Then we have a number of commercial sort of technologies that need to get prototyped and proven out in the department’s environments. DIU is really a critical accelerator there, kind of identifying best of breed in the commercial sector, matching those technology solutions to capability gaps, especially in the COCOMs. The services – the military department – really is where the bulk of our infrastructure and investment is, and they’re critical in making sure we can marry up digital solutions to our legacy capabilities and sort of onboard and scale-emerging technologies, especially in that sort of man, train, and equip space.
So where does CDAO sit? CDAO – I’ve tried to kind of bucket our activities in three areas. Enable, so that’s the policies and the acquisition strategies but also, you know, the investments and infrastructure that are needed. Scale, that is maintaining the enterprise platforms and services needed to actually have adoption. So that’s everything from our data infrastructure to, as I mentioned, that training and deployment environment we’re talking about. And then speed, and that’s really focused on making targeted investments to help accelerate capabilities to, I’ll call it, prove out the case or help solve critical gaps in a time sensitive way. We’re doing that with CJADC2, but also on priority digital solutions – things like the National Background Investigation System and key sort of AI capabilities we want to onboard and demonstrate the value of.
Mr. Allen: That’s amazing. So you’ve got the sort of three – I don’t want to call them functions, because you have this sort of official list of five functions – but you’ve got these three priority areas that you’re trying to work on. And now I’d like to hear a little bit about, you know, how that matches up to the budget. Because you’ve got, I think, in the FY-25 budget justification – for the request for FY-25, CDAO has around $650 million of RDT&E, probably some additional funding in O&M.
You could conceivably spend all of that money on any one of those three priorities that you just listed. So I’d love to hear a little bit about where you are investing, and how the money matches the outcomes that you’re trying to achieve. So if it’s all right with you, let’s start with enable, which is this policy and investments, as you just said. So what would you sort of highlight in terms of what are those investments you’re making, and what do you expect to see this year and next year come out of those?
Dr. Plumb: Yeah. So we have a couple of different investments in that enable bucket. Some of it are – some of it relates to these, sort of, foundational enablers in key areas or SUNet environment, right? These –
Mr. Allen: for folks who are not familiar with SUNet, could you just sort of explain a little bit about what that is?
Dr. Plumb: Yeah. It is a not classified – not just unclassified, not classified – development environment that allows us to take promising technologies and actually bounce it up against our data and systems in a controlled way to help us both test the capabilities in a sort of operational functions, but also do test and evaluation to include some of our responsible AI pieces. And so that – in that enable bucket additional – in addition to the environments are things like building out our responsible AI toolkit.
Which I think is a really great example of how CDAO’s a unique kind of organization. We don’t just write the policies on what responsible AI means. We translate that into tools that can then be used against specific applications to make sure they’re actually comporting with those – sort of, the technical execution is comporting with the values and principles that we want in our responsible AI work.
Similarly, we have investments in underlying cyber technology and test and evaluation infrastructure. That’s really aimed at accelerating the pathway from test – from prototype all the way to deployment, working in close partnership, for instance, with our colleagues in the Office of Test and Evaluation to make sure artifacts that come out of our ecosystem are actually useful for that test and evaluation independent review and approval.
Mr. Allen: Mmm hmm. So if I could just sort of understand how these pieces fit together. One of the things that I experienced during my time serving in Department of Defense, how – was how hard it was for private sector interesting algorithms or AI models to ever touch DOD networks or DOD data sets. And is it fair to say that SUNet is an attempt to sort of make that easier for both the government and the developer, by providing this environment where unclassified or – sorry, I guess, non-classified government data can actually find its way to be tested and evaluated with what the private sector is saying they could be brought to bear, if their systems were to be brought onto DOD networks?
Dr. Plumb: Yeah. That’s a great description. Come on back anytime. (Laughter.) We’ll put you out on marketing.
Mr. Allen: Yeah.
Dr. Plumb: No, that’s exactly right. And I think part of this, you know, kind of harkening back to my answer on, like, what does the government need to do. Like, to enable this commercial technology to actually meaningfully be adopted, we need these kinds of environments that can take the data in the department, mash it up against commercial technology, and see sort of what are the tech solutions that are actually solving our capability gaps?
Mr. Allen: And is that – is that type of service that you have, is that primarily serving the work that CDAO is doing? Or is that provided as a service to other folks in the department?
Dr. Plumb: I think largely the latter. And I guess more generally, as a principal in CDAO, while we have some analytic functions that we retain, and there’s some AI thought leadership and digital transformation focus, a big part of the maturation of the organization is making sure we have available these types of enterprise platforms and systems, because those enterprise capabilities, the scale of buying them and sustaining them makes sense to have in a central place. But the particular AI capabilities, like the digital solutions, we’re not going to be the closest to the end user. And so probably not going to be ourselves the ones sort of picking the right applications and bringing them across. We will occasionally in this speed kind of function – so in the context of, for instance, partnering with DIU on replicator, we’ll look at some specifics. But generally, this is intended to be an enterprise offering to enable enterprise-wide AI adoption.
Mr. Allen: So SUNet is part of the story that CDAO and its predecessor organization, the JAIC, and even Project Maven before that has been investing in for a while. There’s also this sort of new initiative that relates to enterprise infrastructure, perhaps, called Alpha-1. And could you sort of help us understand how those pieces fit together?
Dr. Plumb: Yeah. And they really nest together. So the way I would think about it is, SUNet is a particular environment. Within that environment now you need a bunch of stuff, right? So you need labeled data. You need T&E on that particular application. And then you need all the other kinds of documentation to get through the government, I’ll call them, bureaucratic processes. I don’t mean that in a negative way, just, like, there are a bunch of boxes you’ve got to tick to get bought at scale and fielded.
What Alpha-1 is aiming to do is for a particular use case set – in this case, sort of focused on the autonomy use cases in the department – like, let’s build out all of those pieces, the AI scaffolding as we’ve termed it, that fits together a labeled data, additional compute needed to actually test sort of more advanced AI capabilities, and those T&E resources in an end-to-end way, for a particular use case, to help us accelerate progress on that use case. But it kind of takes as a critical input into it this SUNet system – ecosystem which, as you rightly point out, has been around for a while and we know has this value proposition of being able to have the commercial sector actually come in and be able to use it.
Mr. Allen: That’s great. And so in the FY-25 budget, this entire category of thing, called foundational enablers as well as AI/ML scaffolding – that’s $150 million for AI/ML scaffolding, $198 million for foundational enablers, which includes SUNet. And these types of investments are – you know, they sound like big numbers. But the DOD is an $800 billion-plus organization.
And so I’m wondering, you know, if your goal is to scale across the department, the department is really big scale, right? Three million people, $800 billion. So is that enough money for you to provide that development infrastructure to the entire DOD? Is that enough money for you to provide labeling services to the entire DOD? Or is there some other way that you’re going to, you know, reach the scale that you need, that is separate from this pocket of money?
Dr. Plumb: So I think the way I would think about this, is this a good sort of seed money that allows it to – allows us to both flesh out what it is we’re building and begin that infrastructure process. Now, this is under the theory kind of, like, if you build it, they will come. You got to have something you can build first. This allows us to build that. If the value proposition is right – and I think we’re already seeing a lot of interest in both – from the COCOM side and the services side – then we can, you know, cost share to scale this with the military departments where the bulk of the Department of Defense investment is, as well as with the COCOMs and other partners to make sure we’re actually expanding the infrastructure in a way that makes sense.
So it’s not – would I say, like, this is all of the infrastructure investment for AI deployment in the department? No. Is this a start at showing what enterprise infrastructure could look like, and if that kind of meets the need in a – you know, again, we are starting with the use case, we’re starting with autonomy. If, in that sort of experiment-based empirical approach this looks like the right solution, then let’s build out on that. And we can figure out either within the existing structure or future budget what expansion looks like.
Mr. Allen: Got it. So right now if a program office in a military service comes to you and says, we want to do, for example, as you said, autonomy. And we’re going to need a lot of development infrastructure. We’re going to need a lot of labeling services. Right now, we’re not good at managing that stuff. Would you please manage it for us? Right now, you will foot the bill, in addition to executing the activity. And then, it sounds like what you’re saying – correct me if I’m wrong – is that, you know, once you sort of reach some kind of critical mass, then perhaps there’d be more of a cost sharing type approach?
Dr. Plumb: Exactly right. And I think maybe – to just put a slightly additional tweak on it – we have some priority use cases. If you came with a different use case, and came with dollars and wanted that to be executed, we could look at doing that in the near term as well, right? So I think there are two ways to – there are two dimensions to expand. One is more volume on the current use case, and the other is additional use cases.
Obviously, as we build out in this particular use case, we’ve got an eye towards what scaling this looks like. But we’re also taking lessons from this use case to think about what other pockets of labeled data do we want to think about bringing in and invest in, either as an enterprise way or in a cost share? And that’s going to be heavily informed by what we hear from program offices, as well as from the combatant commands, in terms of their capability needs.
Mr. Allen: So the seed money – and the way that you’ve said this is, like, building it, but building it in partnership with people who need it. That solves the traditional chicken-and-the-egg problem of DOD enterprise infrastructure.
Dr. Plumb: Yeah, that’s exactly what we’re trying to do with that – exactly right.
Mr. Allen: I get why you are going there. The next thing I want to understand is – and you have a private sector tech background so I know you’ll know the sort of weight associated with this word, but what is the flywheel for how this overall approach, you know, builds momentum in terms of what do you get back as more and more users adopt the system during that period where you’re perhaps paying for it, and then how does that build momentum overall into the flywheel-type motion?
Dr. Plumb: Yeah, so I think there are two things. One is they just hearken back to this experimentation-based approach we have, you know, in most things, which is in order to experiment, you need people to use your thing so you can experiment and actually test what works. So if we want to get an end-to-end environment that allows us to take label data, test and evaluate prototypes that come from the private sector, come out with artifacts, and then field those prototypes in a more rapid way, we need some use cases to help us prove out that value proposition. That lets us do that. And that includes things like working with – I’ll just use this T&E as an example – working with the Directorate of Operational Tests – and yeah –
Mr. Allen: Office of the Director of Tests and Evaluation – yeah.
Dr. Plumb: Yeah – to help us – like what artifact – what are the artifacts that need to come out of this environment to allow them to do their independent assessment? What do we think digital range time is that we need from the TRMC and the work that they do in kind of managing testing? What are the policy documents needed to make sure that we are comporting with the relevant policies that govern this? What are the data-sharing requirements we need to have between different elements as we pull in the data that’s needed to label and then train these models, right?
We need to work through with answers to all of those, and there is no silver bullet to that. It really is figuring it out. And to our mind, the best way to figure that out is to actually just pull a use case all the way through. You have the end result of both actually delivering a thing people need, so that’s valuable. But also you’ve learned a lot things so the next time you can do it faster and faster and faster. And I think that’s sort of our theory of change, which is let’s adopt, experiment, adopt, experiment, and the way to do that, we think, is by starting off with picking a use case where we know there is real value to our end users, the warfighters, and then just pulling that all the way through, and then seeing what we learn, and then rinse and repeat.
Mr. Allen: So, one of the things that your predecessor had spoken about, Dr. Craig Martell, was the goal of a data mesh for the entire department. Now do programs that access your enterprise infrastructure, is there some mechanism by which you are seeking to incorporate them into that data mesh?
Dr. Plumb: Sure. I would –
Mr. Allen: Making them conform to standards, for example?
Dr. Plumb: Yeah, yeah. So, I guess there are couple of different pieces to this. We have – we want to have an open federated data architecture – a data mesh is a version of that. I think that is – part of that is going to be some of the folks newly entering program offices who want to leverage label data and come back on the outside.
But a lot of that is going to be dealing with how we contract for and own our own data within the government, which is sort of going to be independent of new capability integration of digital solutions – not entirely because those digital solutions themselves will create data, which we want to make sure we own, but think of it as if you’ve got a whole bunch of sensors, and they are producing data, a program office coming in isn’t going to drive whether the government owns that sensor data and how that integration work is. So we need to have a data mesh. It’s the only scalable way to do it.
We also need to have an open architecture and sort of data marketplace that allows us to match digital solutions to the right data sets to deliver that into the department, and then we need program offices who have – program offices or, again, combatant commands like, you know, and depending on how we’re – the particular problem we are trying to solve – who can come with clear requirements, either the requirements Document Services have or capability need statements from the COCOMs, and apply those to the tech solutions to allow us to decide what tech solution is best solving the capability needs.
Once you’ve got that going, there will then – our theory – the cases, there are way more things that you will want to move through that system than there will ever be bandwidth to do it at sort of the OSD enterprise level, and so starting to build out the enterprise service where it doesn’t take us shepherding it, but there is capacity to onboard new use cases and then let the program offices do it is kind of the theory of the case for that. But we also need to fix the back-end data architecture, and that’s what the sort of Open DAGIR-driven initiative is really focused on – that sort of infrastructure or architecture piece.
Mr. Allen: We’re going to get to Open DAGIR in just one second, but I had a final question on this area. Which is: One of the metrics of success, at least in my own mind here – feel free to disagree – would be are you seeing adoption by military service program offices. So I realize some of these initiatives are in early days and some of this needs to be classified for very good reasons, but is there anything that you can share today about, you know, what type of adoption or partnerships you’re seeing with program offices for the enterprise infrastructure or for the other types of federated services that you’re looking to provide?
Dr. Plumb: Yeah. Look, I think the easiest one is, you know, going back to that Replicator example, we have program offices in each of the military departments who have autonomy systems. Those systems now need to both think about their own C2 infrastructure as well as how we execute that in an integrated way, and all of that needs to come through a sort of enterprise joint level process.
We’re working with DIU and recently just signed an MOA with them on what that process looks like. And so I think there is a number of – and just as a concrete kind of way that we are managing that we have a monthly acquisition advisory group that includes PEOs in this sort of digital space from each of the services in SOCOM to talk through some of these integration approaches – what makes sense to come into the enterprise service, what enterprise service offerings would make most sense for them versus service specific ones, and where we can lift successes from a particular service to be an enterprise offering and where we need to create new enterprise offerings to meet the different services requirements. So –
Mr. Allen: That’s great. So I’ve been thinking of DIU and Replicator in particular as, like, very much an OSD initiative. But what you’re saying is it’s already tied into program offices –
Dr. Plumb: Yeah. Yeah. Sure is.
Mr. Allen: – and military services. And so CDAO is going to play a big role in terms of the development infrastructure, test and evaluation infrastructure, for some of that work, right?
Dr. Plumb: Yeah. What I would say is, like, the digital enablers that enable these kind of –
Mr. Allen: Like data labeling or something else?
Dr. Plumb: Well, I mean, I think, you know, again, the – without getting too far into sort of classification bounds, there’s a host of digital enablers that are needed to take a number of hardware platforms, integrate them, and have them be able to meet an operational need.
DIU is rightly focused on two big pieces of that. One is what are the right commercial solutions and how do we bring them in, and they’re working with the program offices where those digital solutions are already on contract to do it. I mean – oh, sorry, those hardware solutions are on contract to do it. And the second piece is DIU is really the center in terms of coordinating efforts across the department so that the service work, other OSD work, and their work all fit together.
So in that context we’re working on this cross-cutting digital enablers work with them to help really make sure we’re able to have the right environment to test and deploy, test and field these capabilities as rapidly as DIU has in their program plans in a consistent and repeatable way.
Mr. Allen: Yeah. And previously Project Linchpin of the Army had also expressed a great deal of interest in working with CDAO. Is there anything you can share about how that’s going?
Dr. Plumb: Great. They were incredibly helpful, in fact, in harkening back to Open DAGIR in helping us think through how – what it – you know, we use these words like open and data architecture and data mesh, right, and that has to translate into actual contract language that companies can understand, and then into observable performance that the government can hold performers accountable to.
What I think the Army Project Linchpin did is not only have a good idea but actually think about how that gets pulled through into execution in a way that’s been incredibly informative, for instance, for us in CDAO in thinking about an enterprise – what enterprise infrastructure that is open really needs to look like.
Mr. Allen: That’s great. And so now let’s go right to the heart of it, the Open DAGIR initiative. So I realize this has been in the news a bit recently but let’s assume, you know, some nontrivial share of the audience has never heard of Open DAGIR, which stands for Open Data and Applications Government-owned Interoperable Repositories. So for the listener what exactly is Open DAGIR? How does it fit into the overall story you’ve been telling here?
Dr. Plumb: Let me start with how we used to do things. The way we used to buy – the way we liked to buy things traditionally in the department is in what I would call a vertically integrated way, which is I have an end effect I want – a capability. Now, in digital technologies that’s typically a user interface, right. So I want to see all of my things on one thing or I want to pick a target and be able to connect to something to prosecute that, whatever. I want to know where I can do logistics and be able to pick and apply it. I want to pull that through end to end, and so I see this user interface that allows me to make the kind of decisions at the speed I want, and I buy all of the back – I think that all of the back-end piece of that is just a price of buying that front end piece. It is not.
Mr. Allen: Yeah. (Laughs.)
Dr. Plumb: So that’s kind of – that was the problem I kind of came into which is it’s clear we need these different interfaces. It’s clear we have a bunch of mature applications that need to be scaled and it’s clear we need these different interfaces. It’s clear we have a bunch of mature applications that need to be scaled. And it’s clear we need an open, interoperable data architecture. How do we get all three of these at once? So that’s really what Open DAGIR is intended to get after. It breaks that procurement process into three big chunks.
Chunk one is the enterprise-level data infrastructure. And those you can think of in broad use case categories. So strategic C2 we did on the Palantir procurement. We just announced our intent on the enterprise analytics space, on how we’re going to compete that. So these are really buckets of a bunch of different data integrations, data management, metadata management, right, that allow you to have a bunch of data that’s connected to each other for use in particular applications. So that’s one bucket. And those are big contracts, right, because a lot of money goes into that back-end data.
The second is enterprise-level licenses. So think about this – the easiest way to think about it is, like, Word, or Excel, right? Like, you don’t want every individual who wants to use that, or every, like, 50 individuals, to buy that license themselves. We buy it at the corporate level. (Laughs.) But we were doing that for sort of – for other kinds of applications. We were doing that at the application level, right?
And so rather than doing that, for applications we know there exists sufficient demand for, let’s get enterprise licenses. And that’s a place where, just to harken back to your service question, we’ve had a lot of synergy with the services kind of understanding not just our own needs and sort of fourth estate and COCOMs – or, OSD and COCOMs, but also in the services where, again, this is a place where the government can make cost-effective investments because the leverage of the bulk buy allows you to drive down the cost per license.
Mr. Allen: And the way in which – you know, you’re presumably actually the contracting agent here. But the way in which services get their share of this application license is by putting money on the contract vehicle, or something else?
Dr. Plumb: Yeah, exactly right.
Mr. Allen: OK.
Dr. Plumb: And actually, the way we’ve done – at least, the way we’re intending to do several of these is that CDAO is really the sponsoring PSA, and we have an executive agent that’s a contracting office in a service.
Mr. Allen: Got it.
Dr. Plumb: And so it’s not unusual for these kinds of large things for then to allow sort of intra-government, intra-DOD transfers into that account on that contract. So our contract ceilings take into account the idea that you would have other – not just the dollars we’ve committed, but the broader –
Mr. Allen: But the DOD-wide customer base.
Dr. Plumb: Exactly right. And so that’s the enterprise. So, the second layer. So first layer, data infrastructure. Second layer, enterprise licenses. Third layer is – and that’s where you want sort of an agile requirements and acquisition process for this prototypes, these new ideas, digital applications to be able to come into the environment and go through an experimentation phase.
So for that, we’re using some of the more flexible procurement vehicles. Things like prototype OTs, and our Tradewinds process inside CDAO – which is a sort of expedited review process – combined with our experimentation series, called the Global Information Dominance Exercises, to sort of match capability gaps that we hear from the COCOMs in a prioritized way with technologists and potential future technology solutions. And then, an acquisition pathway, via Tradewinds, to test those solutions and see if they solve the gap.
Mr. Allen: This is interesting. So if you are an operator in a combatant command, and you have a problem set, in many times in the DOD anytime you spend any of your effort on solving this problem, you’re not really helping yourself. You’re helping your successor’s successor, right?
Dr. Plumb: Yeah, best case scenario.
Mr. Allen: Because that might not – yeah, that might not be fielded to the COCOM until multiple rotations have filled your position. But what you’re saying here is, with Tradewinds – which is this rapid acquisition pathway, and with GIDE, which is this rapid experimentation pathway, you can actually offer a COCOM operator, like, no, this is not your successor’s successor’s opportunity to benefit. Perhaps even you could benefit if you put this requirement to us and we have this rapid way to get it done.
Dr. Plumb: Exactly right. And then let’s test and experiment with it in a sort of global cross-COCOM way, so that if it can solve other COCOMs’ solutions, if we get enough demand for it, we actually have a pathway to move you from a prototype OT, from a small-scale deployment to solve specific problems, into, say, enterprise licenses, because it’s meeting an enterprise need.
So the idea is – not everything needs to, right? We can have lots of technology solutions that are particular to problem set or COCOM. And the way to buy them and build them is in this prototype rapid acquisition pathway. But you may want at least the option to, hey, we’ve solved this problem. Wouldn’t it be great if we could scale that and sustain it? And so we wanted to make sure that there is sort of moveability between these different tracks.
Mr. Allen: So you mentioned Tradewinds, which is something that CDAO runs as an acquisition pathway. But what are the actual mechanisms by which Tradewinds is faster? You mentioned OTAs, other transaction authority, which DIU also uses. But OTAs only allow you, at least in my understanding, to buy the prototype. They don’t actually allow you to use that same contract vehicle for the scaled production. Is Tradewinds – obviously they’re offering OTAs. Are there other things that Tradewinds is doing that is designed to make it faster for –
Dr. Plumb: Yeah. So I think the key to recognize Tradewinds is less on the contract pathway, though OTs are a way we do that and more on the competitive selection process, which is it’s a streamlined way to submit a video effectively about your technology solution, have it considered in a process that counts as a competitive selection process, and then if it’s selected to meet a particular contract vehicle. Then it is a competitively selected solution selected on that contract vehicle.
Mr. Allen: Wow.
Dr. Plumb: That has benefits for other things to include prototype OTs, for instance, competitively selected prototypes can be eligible for longer-term production contracts if they’ve met the key requirements at the end of that prototype phase. So it’s a – it’s intended to be a streamlined pathway in that you’ve got to prove out your technology, right? Your technology has to meet a capability need or a gap – a requirements gap, and then it needs to prove out its promise in that in a way that meets the KPPs or equivalent. But then it is a streamlined way to get onto those procurement type vehicles if that’s what makes sense.
Mr. Allen: That’s great. OK, so a combatant command has a problem. They come to CDAO. They launch this partnership. It results in actual acquisitions happening. It results in some experimentation series as part of guide, perhaps.
And now what is actually the path between that and scaled? You know, the valley of death that we’re all familiar with in the DOD environment is the man, train, and equip function that the services provide that is critical for the sort of sustainment. You know, you gave this to me this year. Who’s going to give this to me for the next 10 years? How does what you’re doing here help solve that question?
Dr. Plumb: Yeah. So let me take that in a couple of different parts. One is we always talked about the valley of death being bad. I’d just like to say up front, there are some things that should die in the valley of death, right.
Mr. Allen: Definitely true.
Dr. Plumb: So, like, my – our metric for success here can’t be everything survives forever at the Department of Defense. Point one.
Mr. Allen: Great point.
Dr. Plumb: Point two, not – I think for digital technology in particular, not all things need to be sustained. The reason I say that is our digital solutions sometimes are enduring solutions that we want to sort of continually update. I’ll come to that in a minute. But there are also sometimes digital solutions that bridge us from one set of digital capabilities to the next generation of those. So I think it’s helpful for us to think about digital technology, some of which are, I’ll call it attritable, right?
And so we want to make sure they’re funded for, let’s say, three to five years, but not, you know, enduringly into the future forever because we actually want them to be deprecated in favor of future technology and that forcing function for continual upgrades is helpful. So that’s a sometimes problem. But it is distinct from kind of a lot of the way we approach hardware and so it’s just worth keeping in mind and is very much envisioned in the software acquisition pathway. So not, like, this is not a great Radha idea, though I think it’s helpful to frame. (Laughter.)
So the third piece is then how do we get – for software solutions that need to get sustained forever how do we sustain them forever – or sustain them in a meaningful way? I think what the Tradewind pathway allows us to do is say you’ve got a competitively selected digital solution. Now you’ve got a prototype that you can demonstrate in it. You’ve got a mechanism through these enterprise licensees to actually integrate that in a directed subcontractor kind of way to however we’re managing the data infrastructure most relevant for that.
Now, I say that for two reasons. One, that allows you scale, right. So if you’re going to get scaled and sustained in that. Two, it allows you access to a procurement level vehicle, which are sort of the ID IQs or equivalents that govern the enterprise level infrastructure and enterprise licenses. And, three, with things like directed subcontracting and IP rights it allows a balance between the prime, sort of, data stack owner, the sub data application builder, and the government to allow us to negotiate important things like IP data protection, but also government ownership of sort of the intermediary products.
And that’s part of what the Open DAGIR sort of six-week sprint that the team has been working on over the last six weeks has been building out ahead of this industry day that we’re having tomorrow to sort of talk through some of those business processes in the context of our strategic C2 work.
Mr. Allen: Got it. And so, you know, thorny questions like intellectual property – what does the government own, what does the contractor own – I think CDAO wants to have the sort of here is typically the best answer, you know, and the entire Department of Defense. If you don’t want to start from scratch and figure out everything here’s an answer that we like. For most problems you can just use our answer.
Dr. Plumb: Exactly. Exactly right. And that’s where, going back to that acquisition advisory group, having that conversation with the PEOs to understand the language that they are finding effective, the language we’re finding effective, and also how we’re integrating that into our contracts and deliverables, has been a helpful construct for actually meaningfully translate open and government ownership, IP protection, these words we use, into actual language that can be enforced and also understood on both sides of the contract.
Mr. Allen: Great. So you mentioned GIDE, this experimentation series. And one of the things that GIDE has been very important in, and that CDAO is very important in, is in CJADC2. And it wasn’t that long ago that the deputy secretary of defense stated that we have actually demonstrated the minimum viable product for CJADC2 in a GIDE exercise, if I’m not mistaken. And so could you sort of explain what that means – where we are today with CJADC2, and where we’re going, and what CDAO’s role is?
Dr. Plumb: Yeah, absolutely. So let me just start with C2. (Laughter.) And I say that jokingly, but C2 is a longstanding war fighting function, right? So the question is really, like, what is CJADC2, and why do we put all those extra letters in front of C2? The answer is that to effectively execute C2 at the strategic, operational, and tactical level, commanders at each of those levels have to integrate vast amounts of data and information from all domains, all different kinds of sensors, right, land, sea, air, and then integrate it into some kind of usable interface that allows them to make decisions.
So as the volume of data coming in has increased, and the free – and the pace of – the anticipated pace at which decisions need to be made has to be faster, you see the kind of data integration and visualization problem. That’s what we’re trying to get after in CJADC2.
Mr. Allen: Yeah. And in the – for folks, you know, who had experience in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the operations center – the traditional way you solve this problem is you put a bunch of people in a room. And when somebody has something that they think the whole room needs to know they, like, stand up and yell.
Dr. Plumb: Exactly right.
Mr. Allen: Which is suboptimal. (Laughs.)
Dr. Plumb: Suboptimal. And also a lot of swivel chair solutions. I, myself, having done this in Afghanistan, where you sit at one computer, you enter the numbers, and then you go look at this other computer and enter the numbers over here. And while that’s a great job for a GS-14, and gets you some deployment experience, is probably not the most effective way for us to sort of integrate data and information.
So the idea that’s in CDAO was to take an experimentation-based approach. And so pulling together a cross-department effort looking at what is the kill chain we want to close? Where are the integrations we need to solve? What are the things warfighters need to be able to integrate that information and make decisions? And let’s test on a 90-day cycle the technology solutions to come up with what is right in a scalable way.
What we did sort of in 12 months typically takes the department years. And what the deputies – and based on the parameters, assessment criteria we had, in December the deputy did indeed declare a minimum viable capability. Now, the difference between a minimum viable product and a capability is this: It didn’t just include the technology solution. And this is the most important part. It also included the operator use and sort of usability of that for executing the mission.
And that – not quite DOTMLPF because we didn’t have to change doctrine and training – but the real-time operator use and integration of it into a war fighting function is really what the deputy was looking for. She didn’t just want cool tech and cool visualization. She wanted an operator to be able to prosecute the mission thread he or she was working on all the way to execution, in order for us to count that as success. And that’s really what we focused on delivering.
Now, there are lots of kill chains and lots of improvements to be made. And so kind of we’re continuing on this experimentation pathway. But I think, you know, demonstrating, in addition to the actual technology solution, that this experimentation approach, which rather than having a sort of architecture from on high that then we build out for, you know, 12 to 24 months, and then we test for another 12 to 24 months, and then goes to a COCOM, we say: Let’s take a thing to a COCOM. Sit a software engineer and a data scientist and a war fighting operator all next to each other. And just test, and do that, and then work on fixing it, and then test it again. Like, that’s a really – a really powerful tool to accelerating delivery.
Mr. Allen: That’s amazing. So, you know, we’ve been hearing about CJADC2, or originally JADC2, for about five years now. But it sounds like you really hit your stride in the past just 12 months. So I’m curious, you know, this is currently being categorized as part of the experimentation series. And a lot of GIDE is done in partnership with NORTHCOM. You know, one of the combatant commands. When does the work that you’re doing right now start hitting other combatant commands, EUCOM, INDOPACOM, et cetera?
Dr. Plumb: Well, this last GIDE – I mean, GIDE is global. And over the last year, it’s been primarily focused on work with INDOPACOM, actually. So –
Mr. Allen: Oh, wow. So I’m out of date.
Dr. Plumb: So the priority work on GIDE – you know, GIDE as a series sits with CDAO, and we’ve really been working closely with INDOPACOM under the sort of NDS prioritization – NDS 2022 prioritization of China as a pacing challenge to prioritize the kill chains with INDOPACOM and then make sure we can have and end-to-end execution. Now that integrates key inputs from everyone, but including NORTHCOM and STRATCOM, and even EUCOM and CENTCOM. So there is a real opportunity there.
But there is also real synergy, I’ll just note, in the GIDE series of talking about the technology solutions and other COCOMS being, like, hey, I can – that could actually solve a problem I have over here and, you know, kind of lifting and shifting technology approaches to different specific capability gaps, proving out sort of what is the art of the possible with digital solutions, which I think has been a sort of ride-along benefit of the overall experimentation approach.
Mr. Allen: That’s great. And just to make sure, you know, CDAO has this big role in Replicator, CDAO has this big role in GIDE. Do those two things ever connect? Is Replicator ever at all involved in GIDE, or perhaps you – perhaps it’s more than you can share publicly.
Dr. Plumb: How can I put this? Replicator is an approach to accelerating the delivery and deployment, and they focus sort of Replicator 1 on a particular mission space of autonomy. GIDE is an experimentation series that we are using to experiment and test on how we can deliver capabilities, and we focused this last series – some of the mission threads in it – on C2. Those intersect as we need to test out the fielding of capabilities in Replicator with these digital enablers but, you know, as we look to – to hearken back to your flywheel comment – get a number of these department flywheels going. GIDE is really focused on an experimentation – a joint experimentation flywheel and Replicator on as fielding at scale, and those have to intersect to make sure the fielding at scale happens effectively, but they are both processes that need to get flywheel spinning independently.
Mr. Allen: I see. And then Replicator is one big autonomy initiative in the DOD – one of the biggest autonomy initiatives in the DOD. Another big autonomy initiative made some news recently – the Collaborative Combat Aircraft program of the Air Force. There is also the Army Robotic Combat Vehicle, other initiatives. Can you talk a little bit about how the initiatives at CDAO do or do not intersect with these programs?
Dr. Plumb: Yeah, we’re – we are working on our, you know, Alpha-1 scaffolding to be available as a environment to train and accelerate the fielding, regardless of capability.
As I said, kind of just hearkening back, whether that proves out to be the best way to provide enterprise services, I think we’ll kind of see in this same experimentation-based approach, but I do think there is a tremendous amount of promise, especially with the Army, on sort of partnering on creating environments that testing and fielding – testing acceleration and OSD-level support in sort of getting the final mile to fielding can be helpful for, and so that’s where we’re looking to try to see where is the value add from the OSD point of view, either on experimentation or on enterprise-level platforms and services, and we’re making sure we’re prioritizing our dollars in that context.
Mr. Allen: That’s great. So we’ve been talking about all the different functions and capabilities that you are providing on an enterprise scale to the rest of the department. One that we haven’t talked about yet, but one that CDAO has talked a lot about over the past couple of years, is the Advana platform. This is something that started out in the Office of the Comptroller actually –
Dr. Plumb: Yes.
Mr. Allen: – and was part of the reorganization that led to CDAO. So where are we today with Advana, and how does it fit into these other initiatives you’ve talked about?
Dr. Plumb: Yeah, so, look, Advana is a really critical part of our – what I will call our data infrastructure investments. We manage the enterprise analytic stack for the department, which allows us to integrate vast amounts of information used for financial management but also health, and personnel, and logistics, and maintenance, right, and that has a number of no-fail functions for delivery, not the least of which is things like the audit, but also, as I mentioned, personnel work and force planning, which is critical to readiness.
Where we are in the journey is we are just entering into the period of time where we will need to recompete the overall contract for Advana, and we’re working to recompete that in the construct of Open DAGIR, which again means that we need to compete the data infrastructure, the enterprise applications, which will probably be more than one, you know, particular application set. And then this, you know, prototype pathway for analytic applications that, you know, want and need to be tested and evaluated on that Advana stack.
I think the benefit here is we can really create clear data infrastructure investment on this really critical back-end data, those data pieces, in a more modular way than we had before. Advana is like a victim of its own success. It scaled tremendously over the last few years, and that data infrastructure itself, we’re doing some internal upgrades, I think will benefit from an overall look at the data engineering and kind of what the right solutions are for the back-end architecture. And so looking forward to going through that competitive process to see kind of who’s interested in working with us on that.
Mr. Allen: That’s a remarkable statement you just made. Advana is, in some ways, a victim of its own success. What do you – what do you mean by that?
 Dr. Plumb: I just mean, you know, it’s the story – a story as old as time. (Laughter.) And it’s super common on the commercial side too, right? Where you – basically, you have data infrastructure you make, and then if you do it right your demand for that data infrastructure outstrips your initial build. And then you’re going to upgrade your infrastructure and then build on your application until you do. And that’s kind of the sawtooth pattern of digital deployment.
Mr. Allen: But instead of customers paying you at the exact same rate at which your user growth is, you’re going to the DOD budget request process, asking to add capacity to Advana because your user demand growth has exploded.
Dr. Plumb: Yeah. And I think this is – we have had – we’ve had both, right? Customers both paying for it and enterprise-level investment in it. And now we’re at the maturation place where we actually have a pretty good idea of – a very good idea of what the user base is and needs for right now, and what the applications that need to be built on it are, at the enterprise level. And so it’s, you know, a good time for us to just take stock and look at all it has delivered, which is truly amazing.
If you, again, to your point, think about it as starting in the comptroller space on financial management and growing in just two years, you know, a hundredfold in terms of users and across all domains of enterprise analytics inside the department, to be the system of record for that, right, that’s truly tremendous. And so looking now at what is the next kind of journey for Advana look like, and how can we make sure we built the right back-end data architecture, the right enterprise-level analytics, and we have the right acquisition sort of strategy to make sure that can launch into the future just as successfully as it has over the last several years.
Mr. Allen: Amazing. So CDAO has so many different jobs, right? You’re building enterprise infrastructure. You’re developing test and evaluation technologies. You’re writing policy and strategy designed to make everybody else’s life easier in the Department of Defense. You’re leading the way on CJADC2. You’re leading the way on a lot of different parts of autonomy. And it strikes me that it’s almost as though you’re being asked like, oh, Dr. Plumb, would you please just field an Olympic-quality basketball team, and also an Olympic-quality chess team, and also an Olympic-quality, you know, swimming team? You’re being asked to be good at a lot of different types of things. And I’m curious, you know, how you think about it in your own mind, about how do you manage this diversity of focus areas so that the whole is more than the sum of the parts? And how does that strike you?
Dr. Plumb: Yeah. Let me start with, I think that’s the – that was the value proposition of CDAO when it was created, right? We had these real pockets of excellence – the Chief Data Officer Office, which is doing great work on data integration. We had the comptroller team doing great work on Advana. We had JAIC really at the forefront of AI development. You know, we had Defense Digital Service doing sort of our digital SWAT team and response.
And the idea of putting it together was that the sum was going to be greater than each of the individual parts, in part because there are lessons to be learned from the different parts for each other. In part, because that enablement function – the ability to have policies and governance that tie these sort of different elements of the digital transformation together – can really critically integrate and deliver things that couldn’t happen with individual pockets.
And I think because the CDAO itself has kind of proven out this – what we’ve laid out as this hierarchy of needs, which is you have a number of data-hungry processes in the department. Be it AI applications, or analytics, or the need for data-driven digital solutions, right? And so the driving progress on quality data, and then having this meaningful analytics, and then having responsible AI adoption as a sort of nested function within us, has allowed us to scale in a responsible and meaningful way for the department, that I think is tremendous.
The last thing I’ll just say is we are incredibly benefitted by inside CDAO having an extremely talented workforce. These are people who definitely are not there for the government dollars, and are bringing their considerable engineering, software, policy, analytic talents to meet the mission for our warfighters and for the department leadership in a way that really just tells you kind of the value of their sort of patriotic commitment to doing this for the warfighter. And I think the way I think about management for that community is making sure I am putting in the time and effort to enable and make sure they are getting the things they need to do their jobs and try to stay out of the way where I can do things that make it harder for them to do their job.
And I think, you know, a lot of times there is an underappreciation for the civilian workforce and the talent they bring to solving problems for the warfighter, and I think CDAO is a great example of extremely talented civilians and their military counterparts that are working on critical functions and delivering, as you said, a whole host of priority initiatives day in and day out.
Mr. Allen: Great. Now I want to just push you a little bit on this point. There is a quote from Steve Jobs that I like – the former CEO of Apple – where he says, “Focus is about saying no.” So you’ve got this quite broad portfolio of things that you are working on. Is there some rules in your own mind that sort of say, what might be good ideas for the department, might be good ideas for even part of OSD, but CDAO is not going to go there. They’re not going to work on that because we’re focused on these other – you know, a pretty broad portfolio of actions that you talked about?
Dr. Plumb: Yes. I totally agree with that. I think about this in two ways. First, sort of at the strategic level, my general thinking is we should ask sort of what are we doing – like, you know, what’s the value proposition of this thing. And then why does it have to happen in OSD at the CDAO, right? We need to be able to answer that question for everything we are doing because our budget is our time, and our time is finite.
Second, when I first came in, in the first 30 days, I tasked each of my direct-report directors to do what we call the Three Ps exercise, which was to prioritize the set of things we absolutely must get done; to pace – i.e., slow down – things that we want to do but maybe don’t need to try to execute as fast; and the pause things that were not essential for execution. And the idea of the three Ps exercise is to allow you to focus your resources on the things that actually must get executed – your no-fail missions – and then allow you to pace, to slow down, to have sort of the additional area where things you want to make progress on.
But you know you can pull resources from it if you need to for prioritized, and pause – and pause – very importantly, pause; not stop, not kill, not end, right, but pause things you don’t need to do right now. That pause bucket, I’ll just note, can have lots of ideas that we may want to do later or that aren’t right for CDAO that we can pass to other partners to execute, but forcing the discipline sort of by component within CDAO to do that is part of how – exactly right, like, we’ve got a bunch of missions we absolutely must meet, and so we need to align our resources and execution to that. And I think we’re doing our job to do that.
Mr. Allen: That’s great. And in your case, you are working with AI, which is the technology that is not standing still so you decide what you want to focus on, and then something like the large language model revolution comes along. And this is an area where CDAO also plays a big role. You’re leading Task Force Lima on the part of the department. Can you share a little bit of an update about sort of where you are in terms of thinking about generative AI and what CDAO’s role will be in the generative AI story as Task Force Lima presumably winds down at some point.
Dr. Plumb: Yeah, so kind of where we are, candidly, in this story – Task Force Lima is providing its recommendations up to me, and we will provide that to the deputy, both to prioritize the use cases along which we want to begin our experimentation journey on AI adoption, but also to help us understand what the guidelines and guardrails we need to put in place as we begin testing and using generative AI.
I think, to my mind, the CDAO’s role is, you know, twofold in this space. One is, really on that guidelines and guardrails. Like how do we give you the right left and right limits to allow experimentation in a federated way inside the DOD ecosystem because that’s really what’s going to let us better understand and realize the promise of generative AI. It allows what I’ll call responsible risk taking; like, we want people to take some risks, we want you to be uncomfortable, some of these things should fail. We don’t want you to take risks where you shouldn’t be taking them and let us fill that out for you. So that’s one bucket.
And then the critical enablers. And, look, generative AI is an interesting case where, you know, if you think about traditional infrastructure investments, you might want, like, three-quarters – two-thirds, three-quarters of your infrastructure investments, and then, you know, the remaining one-third to one-quarter being sort of your front end user interface and user testing.
These generative AI models are hugely infrastructure dependent. They depend on a tremendous amount of compute, which has energy requirements. They depend on, for DOD, thinking about, like, cloud versus on-premises compute capabilities, and what their transport looks like. So we’re also now taking a look with our colleagues in CIO at just what does it mean to make the department ready for this? And what does that have to look like in future budget requests? And so I think those kind of are the two big areas for us to look at while we enable the enterprise to look at pilots and experimentation on how Gen AI can help them.
Mr. Allen: Fabulous. So there’s one final thing that I just want to ask you, because I’m sure there’s a lot of people who are wondering this. The ADA Initiative was something that CDAO announced early in its life. Part of the story was related to helping out EUCOM right after Russia had invaded Ukraine. So I’m wondering if you could provide an update on ADA, and what has happened, and where we are today with that initiative.
Dr. Plumb: Yeah. So those teams are, first of all, just an amazing set of individuals who are working closely. These are AI and data leads who work closely with the combatant command to help integrate data at the COCOM, forward deployed, and then build out some of the initial applications – or, help them identify and build out the application. A core part of what they also do is help identify the digital readiness of a particular combatant command, provide that report to leadership, and then help leadership sort of understand where changes need to be made, or not.
Where we are in the journey is the ADA teams are out, they’re deployed. We extended them for one year, and now we’re working through the process to go up to DOD leadership on what the long-term sustainment plan for them is. It’s clear that they are extremely valuable to the combat and commands –
Mr. Allen: This is a talent pool they wouldn’t normally have access to, right?
Dr. Plumb: Exactly. Not a talent pool they normally have. I think having – there are some questions about how we want to central – how much central management you do or don’t want. There’s both value in this sort of decentralized, very forward-deployed COCOM ownership, but also having communities of practice, and best practices, and information flow back and forth to the COCOM. So we’re really looking at what are models to kind of take the lessons we’ve had from the last couple of years of ADA and really make the program institutionalized, but in a way that builds on the successes and helps mitigate future risks.
Mr. Allen: And I realize a lot of this is classified, so it’s fine if the answer is you can’t tell me anything, but is there anything about the war in Ukraine in particular that you’re able to say here? I remember, you know, ADA was part of this conversation a while ago.
Dr. Plumb: Without getting into too many specifics, I think what has been critical about that ADA team is its ability to, at the sort of end point, help solve digital problems with everything from tracking flows of things coming in and out, to tracking dollar, to building visual interfaces, right? So there’s just a number of different digital solutions that you can see are – in a world where things are moving quickly, those digital solutions can be built quickly and have real impact. And that really helps us see the value proposition of having this digital talent pool deployed with our war fighters with our combatant commands, to make sure they’re getting those solutions in real time as they need it.
Mr. Allen: Well, Dr. Radha Plumb, thank you so much for coming to CSIS today. It’s really phenomenal to hear about your different experiences across the private sector and across the different parts of the Department of Defense have really enabled you to look at this problem and go out and tackle it, handling so many different – I guess I should say – juggling so many different balls simultaneously. But I really appreciate you spending your time here with CSIS and helping us understand this.
Dr. Plumb: Thank you for having me.
Mr. Allen: This concludes our event. You can watch the livestream available at CSIS.org, and it will be available almost immediately after the conclusion of the event for rewatching or sharing. Thank you again.

34,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/advancing-women-peace-and-security-through-security-cooperation-nato,"Courtney Clarksen, Tyler McAnally, and Kathleen McInnis","July 12, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This series—featuring scholars from the Futures Lab, the International Security Program, and across CSIS—explores emerging challenges and opportunities that NATO is likely to confront after its 75th anniversary.
In the future, NATO may advance its women, peace, and security agenda by mandating gender considerations in security cooperation, encouraging female participation in capacity-building activities, and ensuring operational effectiveness and resilience across the alliance.
Women make up more than 50 percent of society, play crucial roles in security endeavors, and significantly influence public opinion within the security sector. The U.S. security cooperation enterprise is well suited to make immediate and tangible impacts on the women, peace, and security (WPS) agenda by utilizing existing funding authorities and security cooperation parameters.
UN Security Council Resolution 1325, enacted in October 2000, and subsequent resolutions guide NATO’s WPS initiatives. Despite active efforts and routine conferences, women still represent a small percentage of uniformed personnel in NATO (approximately 13 percent) and a slightly higher 23.6 percent in leadership (including civilian) roles. By incorporating straightforward WPS requirements in security cooperation programs, these numbers can reach even higher.
Critics of the WPS agenda routinely offer outdated arguments on the agenda’s negative impacts on military effectiveness and operational readiness, stating that WPS efforts distract defense organizations from their core military functions and capabilities. However, evidence suggests otherwise. Diverse teams, including diverse military units, enhance problem solving, creativity, and decisionmaking. These outdated arguments discourage security cooperation practitioners from recognizing how gender and gender-based violence (GBV) is used in hybrid warfare, despite ample evidence seen in Afghanistan, the Balkans, Iraq, Nagorno-Karabakh, and Ukraine. Adversaries continue to use gender as a hybrid threat in order to degrade morale, create societal divisions, and undermine national resilience.
To date, WPS efforts have mainly focused on establishing policy frameworks, developing national action plans (which have been abandoned by several allies), creating mandatory training requirements, and establishing gender advisers to assist with operational planning efforts. These endeavors will likely impact WPS initiatives in the long term but will do little to enhance the program in the immediate future. Unfortunately, without concrete evidence of how failing to address gender considerations tangibly impacts military operations and national security, the male-dominated security sphere will likely dismiss any efforts toward deep-rooted and radical integration.
As one of the leading security cooperation exporters, the United States should consider the following to enhance WPS initiatives:
Mandate gender considerations in the U.S. National Defense Authorization Act Section 333/332 training and equipment lists, where applicable. Signaling to partners and allies that WPS initiatives need to be a part of any evolution within a security force is important; however, it should be a part of their defense planning. Providing considerations for a total-society approach is a part of defense and security development and can be incorporated into security cooperation program requests. A general “best practice” is that roughly 10 percent of a program’s funding should be dedicated to institutional capacity building (ICB) support. In addition to this, the program should also allocate a percentage of the overall budget to WPS initiatives. This shows how a country is planning to meet WPS initiatives within their society and in line with their capabilities and forecasting. In addition, the Office of the Secretary of Defense should consider establishing a dedicated percentage of the program’s overall funding to advancing WPS initiatives, either through training or equipping. Serious advancements in WPS could be made by simply dedicating 1 percent of an initiative’s total funding to WPS initiatives. NATO’s Defence and Related Security Capacity Building (DCB) initiative currently supports Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Iraq, Jordan, Mauritania, Moldova, Tunisia, and select UN programs. None of these programs specifically outline a WPS initiative; however, programs in Iraq and Moldova do have WPS ties to other programs (gender advisers and military advisers). Adding in a requirement for WPS-specific program lines, as low as 1 percent of the total funding, would strengthen initiatives across all DCB countries.
Identify opportunities to include WPS initiatives in NATO’s Defence Planning Process and ally-specific capability targets. It is no secret that many allies lack robust conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence (CR-SGBV) and domestic violence support services. This capability gap was first highlighted by Russia and Belarus during the 2021 migrant crisis in Eastern Europe, where many governments were ill prepared for the challenges of mass migration. The gap was highlighted yet again with Russia’s renewed aggression in Ukraine in February 2022. The UN High Commission for Refugees estimates that nearly 5 million people have fled Ukraine as a result of the full-scale war, and psychological trauma serves as a key barrier to integration. These recent events add to lessons that should have been learned in Afghanistan, the Balkans, Iraq, and elsewhere. Governments and ministries of defense can no longer ignore victims of CR-SGBV. NATO should consider appropriating WPS capability targets for like-minded allies, which would signify WPS as a priority within the alliance and promote the development of WPS-related capabilities by NATO allies. Creating domestic and expeditionary capacity to care for victims of GBV and CR-SGBV would increase NATO’s ability to counter hybrid threats while adding significantly to peacekeeping operations around the world.
Encourage female participation in ICB activities in order to show the value of balanced gender representation in security organizations and increase networking and mentorship opportunities. These opportunities are for men and women in the security fields. Regional centers, such as the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies, are mandated to achieve a female participation rate of at least 30 percent in center-wide activities. This mandate should be extended to a partner nation’s entire ICB effort, with compliance monitored in combatant command assessment, monitoring, and evaluation reviews. More importantly, ICB providers, such as regional centers and the Institute for Security Governance, should strive to achieve gender parity among speakers, moderators, and leadership. Achieving an appropriate gender balance among content providers and leadership would encourage the visibility of women security professionals and increase access for men and women to all security experts. NATO’s commitment to WPS is crucial to enhancing operational effectiveness and whole-of-society resilience. The whole-of-society approach is a key linchpin in NATO’s resilience, civil preparedness, and Article 3 commitments when addressing vulnerabilities within a changing security environment. Nearly by definition, a whole-of-society approach is not possible without drastic WPS progress. Gender equality, peace, and security are all inextricably linked, each requiring the others, and thereby requiring an aggressive commitment by all member nations through increased representation in NATO missions and domestic policies.

35,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/neglected-domain,Mark Montgomery and Benjamin Jensen,"July 10, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This series—featuring scholars from the Futures Lab, the International Security Program, and across CSIS—explores emerging challenges and opportunities that NATO is likely to confront after its 75th anniversary.
In the future, NATO will need to field a larger, more capable fleet that can deny Russia the ability to hold member states at risk in the maritime domain and degrade Moscow’s ability to conduct long-range cruise missile strikes.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, the maritime focus of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) began to pivot from major combat operations to regional maritime security operations. This less-demanding warfighting mission slowly devolved into a series of minor external operations of the alliance. By the time Russia reintroduced NATO to the challenges of major combat operations in 2022, most NATO navies had already lost the ability to fight a major combat operation.
NATO’s maritime capacity shrunk significantly following the collapse of the Soviet Union, and most of the new entrants to NATO after 1994 brought very few maritime assets of value. Exacerbating this decline, the combat operations that NATO militaries entered into in Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003) had significant ground and air components but very limited maritime missions. As a result, NATO maritime commanders and planners began to focus on smaller regional maritime security operations in the southern flank of NATO to include Africa and the Middle East. These operations—such as Operation Sharp Guard, Active Endeavour, Sea Guardian, and Open Shield—required fewer, less capable ships than traditional maritime combat operations. With few exceptions, NATO member navies shrunk down to the size and priority of the new maritime missions.
The illegal Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and subsequent Russian naval operations have demonstrated the breadth of Russian naval capabilities. At the same time, the war exposed challenges traditional naval powers face keeping up with emerging technology at sea. In a future crisis, Russia could create strategic challenges for NATO in the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, the High North, and even off the coast of Florida, but it cannot maintain sea control in the Black Sea against a Ukrainian navy that fights without any ships. Today, as NATO planners begin to grapple with this new aggressive Russian maritime challenge, planners no longer have the capabilities or capacities they would want to build and implement the maritime plans they need.
As NATO looks to close this gap and build the naval capacity it needs, a few investment areas are clear. Some investments require restoring traditional military capabilities, and others involve responding to the new maritime battlefield demonstrated in the Black Sea over the past two years.
First, NATO needs more maritime assets—specifically, warships. Not all 32 countries can, or should, field traditional navies equipped with multi-mission warships, but for those traditional naval powers, investments are desperately needed. The NATO navies will need a sufficient capacity of warships and maritime patrol aircraft to ensure multi-mission assets are present throughout all the areas Russia can exploit. The U.S. Navy is overtly the largest warship contributor, and to make this contribution more effective, it should expedite the stationing of two additional ships in Rota, Spain, which would effectively increase the total to six AEGIS destroyers. 
Second, undersea warfare capabilities need expanded investment—despite Russia’s budgetary challenges, the Russian navy has consistently developed, constructed, and deployed highly capable attack and guided missile submarines that can threaten NATO operations and logistics. While construction of submarines is not a realistic goal for most member states, the littoral NATO nations can invest in less expensive assets such as ocean surveillance ships and maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft. As the technology develops, littoral states can also invest in undersea warfare drones.
Third, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has demonstrated Russia’s commitment to persistent ballistic and cruise missile employment. Ironically, Ukraine’s cruise missile attacks against Russian Black Sea fleet assets have demonstrated the vulnerability of ships to these types of attacks. This has been reinforced by the cruise and ballistic missile and drone attacks by Houthi rebels against merchant shipping in the Red Sea beginning in October 2023. A significant number of NATO member warships lack the weapons control systems and affecters needed to deal with a high-density air threat environment. Additionally, no NATO navy has a good solution for either the very high-end risks (hypersonic maneuvering cruise missiles) or the low-end risks (drones). 
Fourth, one of the big takeaways from two years of maritime combat in the Black Sea is Ukraine’s ability to use land-based anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs—domestically manufactured Neptune and ally-provided Harpoon), as well as unmanned autonomous surface vessels (USVs), to prevent Russia from asserting sea control in the Black Sea. This has removed the threat of a Russian amphibious assault (which would stretch Ukrainian defenses even thinner) and allowed for Ukraine to slip its grain shipments out through the Dardanelles and into the Mediterranean. Numerous smaller NATO littoral states, especially those on the Baltic Sea, may not be able to afford destroyers and frigates, but they can procure land-based ASCMs and USVs.
Fifth, there is the need to invest in enhancing and protecting maritime logistics. This applies to the traditional aspect of maritime shipping and ports as well as the increasingly important issue of protecting critical undersea infrastructures such as fiber-optic cables. At the 2023 Vilnius summit, NATO leaders agreed to establish NATO’s Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure in the United Kingdom in order to increase the alliance’s situational awareness about these threats.
After nearly thirty years of contraction and stagnation, the maritime mission set is finally a growth area within NATO. There are a number of key areas for investment: warship capacity, undersea warfare, integrated air and missile defense, land-based strike weapons, and logistics. Not all 32 member nations need to invest in all five of these areas, but there should be some opportunities for every nation that has a littoral presence.

John J. Hamre: Thank you. Thank you very much. Delighted you’re all here. My name is John Hamre. I’m the president at CSIS. And I just want to say thank you all for being here today. We’re delighted to have this conference. I’d also say, you know, we’re responsible for your safety. So if there is an announcement, please follow now. You know, Cynthia is the senior safety officer. She’s in charge of making sure you’re all well and safe. And so if we hear a voice, take her instructions. These exits behind us will take us down and out in the back. If it’s safe to go out in the front, we’ll go out that way. I’ll order ice cream, and we’ll all be happy. We’ll be fine.
Thank you all. Delighted you’re here. I was in Seoul back in March, and that was when I first met Minister Seok. And he had just been in the job for about two weeks. You know, and we were thinking about this conference. And, you know, I was – we’ve been doing this for a number of years, but I didn’t realize, and certainly hadn’t anticipated, how important it was going to be. President Putin’s trip to North Korea has really changed the landscape. It’s really shifted the landscape in a significant way. And we now have to start thinking about this in a new and deeper way.
Korea has always been on the forefront. It holds the flag of democracy on the Asian continent, you know? And it’s going to become bigger, more important now. And we’re going to explore some of that today. I think we’ve been watching this horrific war in Ukraine, illegal, disgusting, what Russia has been doing. We’re seeing astounding developments that are going to have a real impact for all of us as we think about what does combat mean in the future? And it’s – we’re really going to need to be partners, more now than ever.
Now, I’ve been talking with my friends at DAPA for a number of years, and I’ve said we’re ready for the third generation of our partnership. You know, the first generation was you bought our stuff, OK. Then the second generation was you bought the designs and you manufactured our stuff. But at the same time, you were building your own things. You know, and you’ve become a significant arms manufacturing country.
But your market is limited. Our market is limited. We’re going to have to find ways where we’re working together in a more deeper way, where our industrial bases are more connected to each other in mutually supportive ways. This is that third generation. This is where we’re going to have to head. And I think that Putin’s visit has accelerated the urgency for that. And we’re going to explore all of that today.
So I want to say thank you to all of you for coming. I think this is going to be a very important conference today. Minister Seok, thank you for being here. We’re really delighted to have you here. You lead a very important ministry in DAPA. And it’s a real privilege to have you with us today. And Secretary Bush, thank you. When I saw him this morning I said he looks pretty good for a guy that hasn’t slept for four months, you know? I mean, he’s working every hour God sends down. And it’s not only to help rebuild the arsenal for the Army, but it’s to help get the equipment that Ukraine needs for us, to fight for freedom for us. And he’s doing a fabulous job. Doug, thank you.
Let me turn to Cynthia for getting this started, and we’ll get this conference going for real. Thank you all for being here. (Applause.)
Cynthia R. Cook: Thank you, Dr. Hamre. I am Cynthia Cook, a senior fellow here at the Center for Strategic and International Security and also the director of the Defense Industrial Initiatives Group. And it is my very great pleasure and honor to welcome you here today, and to participate in this conference, and to host DAPA as they come to the United States to talk about the very important topic of defense industrial cooperation.
We’ve seen, as the war in Ukraine changes, how Russia is reaching out to strengthen its own partnerships, following a roadmap that the U.S. has set for decades. Our allies and partners are our most important asset, and the Republic of Korea represents one of our single most partners, especially in the Indo-Pacific region. We’re very delighted to have the opportunity to talk about this partnership today. I will start off by introducing our two panelists, and then welcome Secretary Bush to the podium, and then Minister Seok will come up. And both will give some opening remarks.
So first, introductions. Both of these gentlemen have had very impressive careers. Mr. Douglas R. Bush was confirmed by the Senate as the assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics, and technology in February of 2022. In this position, he serves as the Army’s acquisition executive, the senior procurement executive, the science advisor to the secretary of the Army, and the Army’s senior research and development official. He also has principal responsibility for all Department of the Army matters related to logistics. Mr. Bush spent many years on Capitol Hill as a professional staff member of the House Armed Services Committee, rising to the position of deputy staff director of the HASC before coming to the Army to serve as a civilian in 2020. He had served as an Army officer after graduating from West Point in 1993, and he also has a master’s degree from Georgetown University.
Minister Seok JongGun is the minister of Defense Acquisition Program Administration, or DAPA, of the Republic of Korea. In this capacity, Minister Seok is responsible for overseeing DAPA’s extensive portfolio of force improvement programs, the procurement of military supplies, and the promotion of the defense industry. Minister Seok spent most of his career in the Republic of Korea’s Army and retired at the rank of major general and served in a variety of roles including as the director for capability planning of the ROK JCS Strategy Planning Bureau. Minister Seok graduated from the Korea military academy and earned a master’s degree in military operations research at the Korea National Defense University. Thank you.
Secretary Bush, please, we welcome your opening remarks. (Applause.)
Douglas R. Bush: Good morning, everyone. Special thank you to Minister Seok. Thank you. It means so much to have you here, and for your Defense Acquisition Program Administration team here today. And thank you to Dr. Hamre and the CSIS team, including our esteemed moderator, Dr. Cynthia Cook. These exceptional teams have come together to host this amazing event again this year, and I am pleased to be here as part of it. 
The Republic of Korea remains one of our key foreign military sales partners, with 780 active cases, valued at roughly $40 billion across the Department of Defense. Of this amount, the U.S. Army by itself has cases valued at nearly 7 billion (dollars). We have a vital partnership, that is only going to get deeper and more important. We have important work to do, and these conversations like the one today continue to highlight the importance of expanding defense cooperation between our two great nations.
Through close military and industrial cooperation, we can continue increasing interoperability and driving innovation. Our relationship has transformed from one focused initially on security of the Korean Peninsula to what we now have in the form of a comprehensive partnership in which we jointly advance shared goals in security, trade, technology, and democracy. Now we must realize that the challenges we face together require us to deliver even faster in world of acquisition in which we serve, at a faster speed and at greater scale than we’ve ever been asked to do before. 
As we prepare to mark the 71st anniversary of our alliance, let us also celebrate the work that we have done together to achieve joint success. The U.S.-ROK alliance has evolved, as I mentioned, from a security alliance to a strategic partnership of great depth. Through longstanding initiatives, like the Defense Technological and Industrial Cooperation Memorandum of Understanding, first signed in 1988, we’ve ensured continued interoperability of our forces through all aspects of defense acquisition, to include exchanging information on our mutual defense acquisition policies, addressing issues that hinder bilateral cooperation and interoperability, promoting the need for continued maximum interoperability. 
We also continue to increase the complexity of our international armaments cooperation through more engineering and science exchanges, foreign comparative testing activities, and the establishment of the – at the undersecretary level of a science and technology bilateral. We jointly empower this international cooperation in military research, development, test, and evaluation through memorandums of understanding, like the one for RDT&E signed in 2009 to allow for cooperative projects and engineer science and exchange memo signed in 2000 to promote cooperation through personnel exchanges. 
Just last year, we signed a new security of supply arrangement strengthening our bilateral supply chains and industrial bases, as well as addressing supply chain risks. This arrangement enables both the U.S. and the Republic of Korea to acquire industrial resources to quickly meet defense requirements, resolve unanticipated disruptions that challenge these capabilities, and promote supply chain resiliency. Our integration only continues to grow. 
For example, Korea’s – Republic of Korea’s light attack aircraft, the FA-50, is comprised of approximately 60 percent U.S. components. If U.S. allies and partners are buying the FA-50, and have necessary security arrangements, these partners can request U.S. security, communications and munitions, all of that enabled by our partnership. This ensures that the Republic of Korea defense exports are interoperable with our partners and allies. 
With these continued efforts in partnership between our countries, it’s important to highlight the critical role played by the defense industrial base and the collaboration required to realize true technological advancements that enable us to provide the best solutions to our war fighters, again at faster speed and at greater scale. For example, Hanwha, a critical company in Korea, has teamed with multiple companies across the defense industrial base, including on the Army’s Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport Increment II program, through the foreign comparative test efforts. 
DOD leverages the FCT program for testing items from South Korea that have high technological readiness levels that may meet our modernization priorities. Locating world-class products like these in technologies built by allies contributes the defense of the United States and increases our partnership. This testing program is one small example that’s allowed the United States and the Republic of Korea to demonstrate next-generation technology across a broad variety of critical new techs, including artificial intelligence, robotics, and communications infrastructures.
Looking into the Indo-Pacific to enhance the defense industrial base of both the United States and the ROK, respectively, there are ongoing in-depth discussions by the Department of Defense for executing the recently published Regional Sustainment Framework to facilitate logistics in a contested environment, as well as cooperation to distribute maintenance, repair, and overhaul capabilities in the Indo-Pacific. Aligned with the National Defense Strategy and the National Defense Industrial Strategy, this regional sustainment framework underpins the Defense Department’s effort to develop distributed MRO capabilities closer to the point of need by collaborating with allies and partners, such as the ROK, as well as U.S. and international defense industry to come up with joint solutions.
This effort requires significant additional resources from both governments and members of each of our respective defense industrial bases, but ROK efforts to collaborate on MRO initiatives affirms that such cooperation is in accordance with the direction of enhancing alliance posture and capabilities. The defense industrial base is a shared interest, and ongoing collaborations truly highlight opportunities for new and additional industrial cooperation beyond what I’ve mentioned. Strong, secure and resilient industrial bases are vital to both our nations. 
We will succeed together. Through close military and industrial cooperation, we can continue increasing interoperability, strengthening our industrial bases, and then, through that, our collective war fighting capabilities to defend our people. Thank you, and I look forward to today’s discussion. (Applause.)
And, Minister Seok, please. (Applause.)
Minister Seok JongGun: Honorable President Hamre, thank you very much for your warm welcoming remarks. My special thanks must go out to the Director Cynthia Cook for introducing me to the distinguished audience. Also let me express my deepest gratitude to Assistant Secretary Douglas Bush for accepting our request for the keynote speech and attending here today out of your busy schedule. I would like to express my appreciation to all the distinguished guests joining us today, and all the staff members for putting together today’s meaningful event. Last but not least, let me confirm my gratitude to all the audience joining us in real time through an online platform.
Since the initiation of CSIS conference with DAPA in 2016, DAPA and CSIS have been holding this annual event to continue our in-depth discussion on defense industry cooperation. In particular, as the recent exchanges such as the presidential summit between the two countries, elevated the relations of the two countries to a higher level. Today’s conference is being held under the theme of the potential for expanding defense cooperation with the ROK-U.S. alliance. Last year was the historical year that marked the 70th anniversary of alliance between the two countries. And our exchange is becoming more vibrant in various areas, such as defense and diplomacy, including the presidential summits between the two countries.
Against this backdrop, I highly anticipate that today’s gathering will be the catalyst for discussing the ways to shore up defense industry cooperation further down the road. When the very existence of Korea was on the brink of collapse due to the – due to the invasion from North Korea, a great number of the U.S. soldiers sacrificed their lives for the country that they had unheard of and they had never been to before. Throughout the journey, I was surmounting the deep scar and ruins of war to eventually achieving prosperity and standing tall. There always has been the U.S. beside us.
Once again, I would like to express my deepest gratitude for your longstanding support. The ROK-U.S. alliance began with the Korean War and marked this whopping record of the 70th anniversary last year. And it has continued to grow in a mutually beneficial manner. In addition, the presidential summits in April 2023 further pushed the two countries to elevate our relations to global comprehensive strategic alliance. This is the optimal level in relations between countries. And for Korea, United States is the only country that shares the relations of global comprehensive strategic alliance.
As a result, the scope of cooperation expanded from defense cooperation to economic, critical technologies, and supply chain. And the two countries are materializing alliance in action towards the future to ramp up the peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region, going beyond the Korean Peninsula and sharing the value of free democracy.
The global geopolitics are continuously changing. The Ukraine-Russia war and Israel-Hamas war continue to pose threats to the global security. And the peace in the Pacific region is also hung by a thread. In particular, the Ukraine-Russia war has renewed the importance of defense and security to the global community. Arms building is accelerating with the European countries at the center. And as the unity between the allies and friend countries is strengthening, the conflict between the regimes are exacerbating at the same time.
In the past days, during COVID-19 crisis, the global pandemic undermined the industrial capabilities of countries around the world. And the recovery effort is still ongoing. Looking at the defense area especially, requirements for capabilities are soaring in Europe and the Middle East. However, the speed of recovery in production capability in defense industry is slow. So many countries around the world are putting their utmost effort to secure the required capabilities in a tiny manner. As the outbreak of Israel-Hamas war is adding to the threats on the global peace and security, it is expected that the trend of arms builder will continue for a while.
In addition, significance of the Indo-Pacific region has been underscored by the power competition between the U.S. and China, arising from the dramatic rise of China and conflicts in Europe and Middle East. Following the U.S.-Indo-Pacific strategy, countries like Korea and Canada have announced their Indo-Pacific strategies to further shore up cooperation between their allies and friends. Furthermore, as the first industrial revolution brought the era of advanced science and technology to full view, its utilization as a military purpose is becoming more common.
Since the effectiveness of drone and satellite communications has been proven in the Ukraine-Russia war countries, with advanced defense industry such as United States are witnessing the increase in R&D and investment in order to apply these advanced technologies, such as drone, unmanned technologies, and AI, into weapon systems and capabilities. Since the Korean War, Korea has put a lot of effort to enhance national defense capability to maintain peace on the Korean Peninsula. And as a result, we can build the capabilities that we see in our defense industry today.
As such, we wish to further expand cooperation with allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific regions, as the global comprehensive strategic alliance, and participate in the supply chain of global defense industry so that we can make a contribution to sustaining the global order and promote the global peace. Honorable President Hamre, do you remember the concept of the generation three partnership? DAPA members have handed down this concept of generation three partnership that you have proposed.
Generation one partnership indicates the one direction cooperation, where Korea has received capability from the U.S. through military aid. Generation two partnership indicates the cooperation that we have received technologies transfer through offset program or supplying the U.S. with Korean parts and equipment. Generation three partnership means the expanded cooperation that ranges from joint development to joint production and joint market.
In the presidential summit in April last year, the two heads of states agreed to further expand cooperation in in the field of security, industry, science, and technology, culture, and information, based on our alliance in values. In particular, when it comes to the – comes to the defense area, defense industry supply chain sharing, joint R&D for defense, science, and technology, and MRO cooperation have been well ongoing between the two countries.
If we integrate the critical source technology from the U.S. and Korea’s advanced production capability, along with the expansion of joint R&D for defense science and technology, a great synergy will be produced for the regional security. In order to respond to the global geopolitics mentioned at the outset, the U.S. Department of Defense has announced the first of its kind National Defense Industrial Strategy in this January. Also, RSF, Regional Sustainment Framework, was announced in May as well. These two policy updates in the U.S. Department of Defense have the respective purpose of achieving stable defense industry and robust operation and sustainment of the U.S. capability.
But its building block is the cooperation with allies and partners. Considering the current global situation, I would like to propose generation 3.5 partnership, which is the concept that includes joint operation and sustainment to generation three partnership that President Hamre proposed. So to speak, generation 3.5 partnership is the cooperation that the two countries jointly conduct, development, production, marketing, operation, and sustainment. In acquiring capability, Korea has proactively introduced the U.S.-origin capability, considering the ROK-U.S. combined training and its required interoperability. As a result, our accumulated know-how has reached a considerable level. And some of the common capabilities between the two countries are sustained and retailed in Korea.
The maintenance capability in Korea defense companies has been developed in accordance with the time spent for capability operation and our military’s requirements that always pursues the optimal condition expedited the modernization of facility and infrastructure. Adding to that, the application of cutting-edge technology, such as automation, AI, unmanned technology, is enhancing efficiency, reliability, and speed of procedures. As the significance of the Indo-Pacific region on the global stage is ever growing, Korea is ready to make a contribution to peace and security of the Indo-Pacific region, going beyond the Korean Peninsula.
Honorable President Hamre, Honorable Assistant Secretary Douglas Bush, all the distinguished guests and audience, this conference, cohosted by DAPA and CSIS, is the meaningful event where we cherish the ROK-U.S. alliance that has lasted for 70 years, based on our mutual trust, and discuss defense industry cooperation between the two countries. I truly wish that this conference will offer the perfect venue for defense industries of both countries to explore and implement ways to continuously sustain and develop the cooperation between the two countries for the sake of global peace and freedom.
Thank you all for being here today and taking the time to patiently listen to my speech. Thank you. (Applause.)
Dr. Cook: Thank you both for those inspiring remarks, which are really terrific in terms of setting the stage for some questions we have today, to really draw out some of these themes of cooperation that you have raised. I’ll start with a question to Secretary Bush, really focused on the current fight. We’ve seen that Russia’s war in Ukraine has dragged out over two years, and the lessons about challenges to the United States’ industrial base are still being learned. The Army has heavily invested in revitalizing its 155 ammunition production capacity. Can you share an update on this? What other investments is the Army making to modernize for future warfare, with the lessons from Ukraine?
Hon. Bush: So really there’s two efforts underway broadly. One is, as you mentioned, Dr. Cook, the effort to mobilize our industrial base to increase production capacity in order to support Ukraine, but also position us to replenish our own stocks quickly and also support our allies. Many of whom we – of course, our production flows to them, including Republic of Korea.
That effort – we are 6 billion and counting into just industrial investments by the U.S. government to allow for continued and expanded production capacity. That 6 billion’s flowing through the system. About 4 billion has been for 155. Two billion has gone to other things though that also are really important – Patriot production, GMLRS production, Javelin missiles, Stinger, and other precision munitions. So that effort is underway, on track, but is taking time but is broadly going well.
The other aspect of what we’re trying to do in the Army that especially contributes to supporting allies like Korea is our overall modernization effort to improve our Indo-Pacific capabilities, relevant to any fight where we will be supporting Korea. You know, we are already on the ground in Korea. We’ve been there for 70 years. And the U.S. Army is right there, shoulder to shoulder, the U.S. Army and our Korean allies.
But we are also improving our air defense capability across the board. We are improving our long-range strike capability across the board, new systems, our ability to fire ground launch Tomahawks, SM-6, our new PrSM missile. And then improving our ability to do air defense, both more flexibly for ourselves but also with our allies. So I think all those efforts meld together to position us to be able to do more fighting right there with our allies, like the Republic of Korea. But now we have to carry through on it. It’s going to be a multiyear effort. And it’s got to be sustained over time.
Dr. Cook: That last point is very important. And I appreciate your description of systems that will play in the Indo-Pacific region, which is not always seen as the Army’s fight, but it’s clear that it is.
Hon. Bush: Well, in the Republic of Korea it is absolutely the Army’s fight. We’re the ones on the ground right there. And if we go to war, our armies are going to be fighting right there together, like we’ve always prepared to.
Dr. Cook: Yes, side by side.
Hon. Bush: That’s a ground fight.
 Dr. Cook: Yeah. Thank you.
Minister Seok, I’d like to follow up on that question with some reflections on your part. The Republic of Korea is half a world away from the European theater, from Russia’s war in Ukraine. To what extent are insights from Ukraine’s self-defense relevant to you, with the nuclear-armed threat on your own northern border? How are you translating these lessons into guidance for new capabilities, for ongoing acquisition programs, and for other related defense planning?
Minister Seok: (Through interpreter.) Korea is always trying to respond to the threats of North Korea. In order to do that, we are trying to have stable defense industry in order to secure advanced weapon system. And also, we are upgrading continuously our capabilities to improve our security capabilities. The recent Ukraine-Russian war has once again highlighted the importance of being ready and just in time defense capabilities. As a result, South Korea is promoting establishment of a global supply chain and expansion of strategic security partnerships with allies and friends as a way to build a more stable and comprehensive defense supply chain. And such efforts will be improved going on.
Dr. Cook: I appreciate your comments with regard to the global supply chain, and we’ll follow up on those in a bit. It’s clear that the industrial base is not just about the production of weapons, but the entire supply chains that go into ensuring that we have the capacity to deliver support to the war fighter that they need. So thank you for raising that, and we will get back to that topic.
Secretary Bush, along with Russia’s war in Ukraine there are a number of other global strategic concerns. China has been referred to as the pacing challenge. Along with your work in Korea, or with Korea, how are you preparing the army to deter any fight in the Indo-Pacific region? This is a big question.
Hon. Bush: It is. And it’s a big effort across the whole United States Army, of course, and the Department of Defense. It’s outside of acquisition – just acquisition. But one of the aspects of this production surge we’re trying to accomplish is to increase deterrence. We need bigger stockpiles of weapons. Our potential enemies, like North Korea, they need to know we have them, we are ready to use them, and we can mobilize our industrial base, working with our allies in an integrated way, to rapidly respond if aggression comes to our doorstep.
I think my hope is that in addition to just providing more weapons, this effort we’re working through, including with our allies, will help strengthen deterrence by showing that, you know, our industrial bases, when mobilized by appropriate political will and provided sufficient resources, are unmatched. The combined resources of the United States and its allies should deter anyone from taking us on. But we have to show we can do it. We have to show we’re prepared. And we have to show that we are tightly integrated with our allies so they understand it’s not just the United States being the arsenal of democracy, but working with allies so we have an arsenal of democracies – all of them with their own strong industrial bases that are fully integrated with ours.
Dr. Cook: Yeah. That’s a really great point. And I’m going to follow that up with asking Minister Seok to reflect on that a little bit. If the United States should find itself in an engagement with, or even really very, very focused on deterrence, in the Indo-Pacific region, working with allies in the region is going to be critical to success. There’s so many clear benefits to the war fighter, including the maintenance and repair of platforms in theater rather than sending them back to CONUS, to the United States. Where do you think cooperation is most promising, in light of the Republic of Korea’s foreign policy goals and very many industrial strengths?
Min. Seok: (Through interpreter.) In December 2022, South Korea announced the Indo-Pacific strategy on its own as a comprehensive diplomatic strategy to defend and promote universal values. This is in line with the U.S. strategy. The ROK Indo-Pacific strategy has nine major goals, of which the goal of expanding comprehensive security cooperation is to expand security partnership through defense cooperation. Like you said, specific areas for expanding defense cooperation are there. That include shipbuilding and MRO.
South Korea, as you know, is a powerhouse in the shipbuilding technology. It is excellent technology in vessel building and also maintenance. So based on this, we are going to continue to expand cooperation with our allies and friends in this field. This can also be applied to cooperation with the United States, which is promoting RSF policy, which is expected to open a new chapter in bilateral defense cooperation in this regard. And like you mentioned before, fighter jet and others, we can leverage – or, we leverage the technology from the United States already.
So the, for example, middle-grade fighters, such as trainers, on them we can continue interoperability. So I think we need more consideration in this regard. And also in a lot of field ground equipment we think that there’s a lot of room for cooperation. So vessel area is the top priority, and then aircraft, and also ground equipment. These are the diverse areas that I can mention in terms of the potential for future cooperation. And we’re also going to make efforts in this regard.
Dr. Cook: Support your statement that Korea has very strong shipbuilding industry, and is able to produce at scale, and has capabilities and capacities across a wide range of other weapons systems as well.
Secretary Bush, the U.S. Army plays a critical role in cooperation between the United States and the Republic of Korea, as mentioned – as you mentioned, on the ground, right there, right now. This partnership was forged in blood in the Korean War, which ended 71 years ago today. The war in Ukraine has highlighted the ongoing relevance of ground forces and artillery. It’s not just about space and aircraft and ships. It’s also about traditional ground warfare. What are Army acquisition priorities relating to the peninsula? And do you see any particular promising areas for co-development or co-production to support this generation three partnership?
Hon. Bush: Yes, absolutely. So and if you think of first in kind of traditional areas, that would be for the Army, you know, our helicopter fleet, our ground vehicles, our tanks, our, you know, artillery systems, infantry systems. In all those areas, Korea has a – Republic of Korea has an advanced, very technologically capable defense industrial base that can clearly support us logistically, including through maintenance of aircraft, for example, where we share fleets already. We already operate similar aircraft. That would make a lot of sense. But also in working overtime on production, cooperation, and sharing of resources.
However, thinking of future tech – it’s not just old tech, its future – this is where there are many areas for potential cooperation. Unmanned aircraft. We are trying to go as fast as we can to take advantage of drones and new unmanned aircraft technologies. We could obviously work together there. Also ground robotics, an increasing area of interest for the United States because of what we’re seeing in Ukraine. We want to make a major effort to have more ground robotics in our formations. And those two technological areas, undergirded by things like AI and advanced communications networks, those two together could both be critical areas of cooperation with Korea.
Ms. Cook: OK. I want to pull the thread on artificial intelligence and uncrewed systems. Oh. (Background noise.) OK. Tech break.
Min. Seok: (Laughs.) Go ahead.
Dr. Cook: So I’d like to follow up with just a little bit of a detailed question there, Minister Seok. If you could talk a little bit about how Korea is thinking about uncrewed systems, and any investments you care to share in those, or areas of potential fruitful work together?
Min. Seok: (Through interpreter.) Because of the equipment failure, I couldn’t hear the question. Can you repeat that, please?
Dr. Cook: I was following on Secretary Bush’s questions about uncrewed systems on artificial intelligence. Really, I wanted to ask you if you had any thoughts on how Korea viewed the future of these technologies. You are both responsible for production but also for identifying investments in new technology for DAPA. So how are you looking at uncrewed systems as sources of opportunities?
 Min. Seok: (Through interpreter.) So for Korea, we’re faced with many different situations. We’re facing North Korean threats and we have very low birth rate. So it’s hard to have enough force, human resources. And with the fourth industrial revolution, we have to apply that to the weapon system and use that as a gamechanger in our battlefield environment. So that will help us deter wars, and that’ll guarantee our victory if there is a war.
So as of now, many – a portion of our budget goes to the unmanned weapon systems. And we also need a great deal of R&D in this sector. And we are making great deal of efforts in this sector. However, in the military science and technology, U.S. is very much advanced. And applying this science technology to produce weapon system, we need to be able to share it and use it together with the U.S. That’s why we need co-R&D, co-production, and co-sustainment, and cooperation. So we need to be able to cooperate in various sectors.
So all these manned and unmanned systems will replace our traditional systems. And in this sector, we don’t still have a lot of specific areas. But we need to still explore areas that we can cooperate, and we need to have great plans for this. Then, we will have very stable supply chains in that sector.
Dr. Cook: Thank you. Before – I do have another question for you, but I want to give Secretary Bush a chance, if you want to add on to any discussion of uncrewed systems.
Hon. Bush: Yes, of course. I think – working together, I think there’s a lot we could do there also, since we’re on the ground there together already. That would allow for our two armies to, you know, conduct experiments, try new technologies, and do other work that would let us get there further. I think, to the minister’s point about, you know, generation 3.5 and moving to a new level of interoperability and working together, if our defense industries can cooperate, and they are, even if they’re just teamed together closely, for example, on a new robot or a new UAV, that would be another way to, on the commercial side, advance sharing among our two defense industries on these critical areas.
The two together. You need the government and the commercial. Both have to proceed at the same time to have true interoperability. But I think there’s great potential for that. Chief of Staff of the Army General George has made networks, advanced communication networks, and unmanned systems his two lead areas of change for the U.S. Army right now. So that’s where we would be very interested in working more.
Dr. Cook: OK. Thank you. Minister Seok, we’d welcome your comments on that. I also have a question on the global value chain 30, which is the Republic of Korea’s new industrial base policy. A policy reflective of Korea’s role as a – really, a global defense industrial powerhouse. Can you talk a little bit about the goals behind this policy? Has your thinking about the global defense industrial base and defense industrial cooperation changed more recently, given Russia’s invasion of Ukraine?
And in terms of areas for cooperation, one clear lesson from Ukraine is the importance of fires, including self-propelled howitzers and towed artilleries. Do you have thoughts regarding the direction for the development of artillery capability in the two countries, and whether this could be a good opportunity for cooperation? I recognize that’s a very large question, so please take it in the direction that you think would educate the audience the most.
Min. Seok: (Through interpreter.) So GVC 30 and its main goal is to uncover technological edge and advantageous SME countries in Korea, and nurture them into global supply component supply. And Korea’s SMEs can participate in the global supply chains and grow. And the global systems company can expand their own component supply chains and have a stable production capacity as a result.
And the Ukraine-Russian war has reminded us of the uncertainty of the international security environment. And if we don’t have enough combat readiness, it’ll be hard for us to have a stable operations, in that sense. That’s why many of the allies are supplying with multiple support, including munitions. So we have to take lesson from that situation. And we need to have a very stable supply chain amongst multiple allies and partners. And we need to be able to share or produce necessary supplies if there is a need. In that sense, Korea and U.S. need to cooperate in multiple sectors.
And in particular, the ground fire power area has great potential. Korea already has K9 artillery and Chunmoo. And these weapons are – thinking of purchasing these weapon systems, and some already purchased them. And U.S. is interested in this self and towed artillery. And they’re already modernizing this weapons system. But regarding K9 artillery, we already started upgrading our process so we can share our know-hows and experience with the United States. And if that happens, U.S. can save costs and can achieve the level of modernization in this weapon system.
So some of the projects that Korea is already doing in U.S.’ interest, we have many of these items outside of K9 and Chunmoo, so we can sort of have mutual awareness as to what we have and what we need, and we can think of how to cooperate in these areas, then it’ll help reinforce our defense posture and we’ll be able to contribute to stable supply chain establishment.
 Dr. Cook: Secretary Bush, you have any follow-up comments there?
Hon. Bush: So I, first of all, yes, acknowledge actually the K9 system is a 52-caliber, 155-millimeter system, which is very advanced. In some ways more advanced than our systems, because, for example, it has an automatic loading capability. The U.S. Army is going through an evaluation of partner nations with systems that we may be interested in procuring ourselves to advance our goals. We still need longer range. The U.S. army needs range. We want to get that through weapon systems and potentially munitions.
And speaking of munitions, the Republic of Korea is one of our few allies that has the ability to do end-to-end production of artillery ammunition – the whole thing. Which is extremely important. They have it for their own defense needs, but we need to work together more to make sure we remain compatible and cooperate as we ramp our production up, that we are working together, for example, on, you know, making sure that as we ramp up we don’t interfere with Korea’s production for their own needs. These kind of lower level down cooperation things can make a big difference. And I think those efforts are underway, we just have to do it the right way.
Dr. Cook: That’s an interesting point. We think about cooperation as this big picture topic between senior leaders, but it also has to happen on the ground between, you know, majors and more junior civilians.
Hon. Bush: Absolutely. Often those conversations between the majors and lieutenant colonels and their civilian equivalents are actually more productive than the ones we have way up high.
Dr. Cook: (Laughs.) Minister Seok, you spent a number of years in the army yourself, or Major General Seok in this case. Do you have any thoughts on – from your career in terms of these conversations on a working level, and how those contribute to cooperation?
Min. Seok: (Through interpreter.) It’s not easy to answer your question that was just posed, but to be honest we have strategies and policies. And for strategy and the policies, we need to be able to agree on the big direction, then working levels can talk about it. For K9, for instance, that needs to be discussed at the working level. But at the higher level, or senior level, when we talk about that at the senior level, maybe co-R&D of the weapon system and how we can cooperate in that sector, that can be discussed at the senior level – the big picture sort of co-R&D.
So basically, from the perspective of Indo-Pacific strategy, we share values between the two countries. And these shared values need to be materialized and specified. And we need to have a task that can materialize these values. And we need to be able to agree on these specific tasks. Then we can have a specific roadmap that can be discussed at the working level. And we can discuss that and we can explore that more. Military experience is important, but U.S. and ROK militaries and defense industrial bases, we have so much potential for cooperation.
So we can further specify these areas and hopefully draw some road map for future cooperation amongst the two parties. Then that’ll help reinforce the defense posture of the two countries. And in a crisis, we’ll be able to have a stable fighting power, and we’ll have a great environment for our victory. So through these conferences, I hope that we can resonate and come together on these agreement, and that’ll be reflected on the policies. And then those tasks from the policy will be shared and supported at the senior level. If we can have that chain, then bilateral relation between the two countries will further advance.
Dr. Cook: I appreciate your remarks about this conference and other senior leader engagements as important to strengthen the alliance and set the stage for every member of our communities to work closer together and follow this guidance to enhance cooperation. One of our – one of the United States’s new policies that highlights cooperation is, of course, the National Defense Industrial Strategy.
Secretary Bush, we know the NDIS highlights the importance of working with allies and partners as an important line of effort in one of its four lines of efforts. And the goal is to ensure that the industrial base is robust enough to meet the nation’s and the warfighter’s needs, and to allow us to fight together with our allies. How is the Army taking this advice, this guidance from the Office of the Secretary of Defense to the service, to the Army, which is more directly related in industrial base and acquisition planning? How are you working to make sure that the goals of the NDIS come to fruition in your Army acquisition program?
Hon. Bush: Sure. So I’ll give you two kind of lines of effort. One is thinking about the security of our supply chains. And security comes in many forms. One of them is, you know, we have global supply chains for our defense industry. And we need that. And it needs to be, though, shifted in some cases to ensure that it’s from our allies.
So we need not just the best, perhaps lowest cost source of a material or an item, but it needs to be from an ally we can trust, like the Republic of Korea, and that takes appropriate measures to secure that, and is also taking measures to protect their companies, to make sure their key defense industries are healthy and supported. So there’s a security aspect of what we’re tasked from the NDIS to do, which the Army is moving out very quickly on, particularly in the areas of munition production, but also electronics – two sensitive areas and important areas where we want to make sure that we are only buying components and supplies from locations and allies we can trust.
The second part of it is the business-to-business, I would call it, aspect of working together. And this is where us acquiring Korean systems would pay a huge benefit. You know, us buying their systems and incorporating them into our weapon systems, or buying entire weapon systems, is enormously – helps, because it strengthens those supply chain bonds. And also being a good partner when Korea decides to procure our systems, such as helicopters or CH-47 helicopters, for example, that we deliver on time, on cost, you know, on schedule. We work with our defense industry to make sure the business aspects of our relationship are fruitful. We can’t just source that out to a defense industry. We have to actively manage that to make sure we’re being good partners.
So the two together – security and just deepening our ties – are probably our two main efforts right now. And our work with Republic of Korea, we are already deeply integrated. So we’re starting from a strong place. I think we can just only get better as we adopt more systems they have, or source key things from them, to help us be a more productive industrial partner.
Dr. Cook: Thanks. I’m going to ask Minister Seok about the same question. And then I think we should touch on the regional sustainment framework and sustainment as well. So I’ll give you that hint so you can think about that.
Minister Seok, the National Defense Industrial Strategy, as Secretary Bush was discussing, it supports a global production web concept that strengthens relationship between the United States and its allies and partners. The ROK is also exploring cooperation, including with Japan, and building on relationships with other southeast island – Southeast Asian and Pacific island nations. So can you talk about the role for partnership and sustainment in these relationships? You know, both with the United States but also with other allies and partners in the region? How are you working to build on the fact that Korea is such a strong defense industrial producer and such a strong democracy in the region, to bring these capabilities across the across your borders to the region?
Min. Seok: (Through interpreter.) Republic of Korea, as you know, since the Korean War from United States we got a lot of military aid. So we do have the self-defense will. Based on that, we have established our capabilities. Korea is surrounded by not only North Korea, but also other powerful countries. So we always need to have this readiness to respond to any risk. So in order to do that, we on our own need to have the defense ecosystem related to military procurement. That was important for our survival. And as a result, recently, as you saw from the Ukraine war when there was a lot of crisis surrounding that, Korea – such country that has this defense ecosystem. Now they all recognize that Korea has such ecosystem, because of such crisis.
So what we see is that when a certain country – it is very difficult for a country alone to deal with everything that’s required. When you have this weapon system used in the battlefield sometimes it can be broken, sometimes it can be destroyed, sometimes it requires maintenance. And to support that you also need ammunition and so on. So especially during the battle time, it is difficult to support all of that. So in case of U.S., not only in Atlantic area but also in Indo-Pacific area, this country is doing a lot of growth. So the U.S. has established a lot of military capabilities for that.
So under such circumstances, in order to have such capabilities to be exercised, you also need some MRO capabilities, and so on, to support that. So under such context – well, as Soviet Union collapsed, well, there was some peace era. And much of the defense ecosystem has evolved in a different way or weakened. But now we have this new kind of threat. And the role of the United States is expanding. And also other powerful countries are also trying to improve their defense capabilities. And they’re also taking on defense industry very importantly now.
So, you know, for the United States to play such diverse roles in this area, having such weapon system and to support the United States to do that, I think such a stable supply chain and component supply are very important, mostly coming from many allies and friend countries. That’s very important. But in this regard, I think we are now just beginning our discussion on this. And so, like, the vessels, or aircraft, or ground equipment in many diverse areas, I think, we need to explore options for cooperation.
And we need to move quickly on that, I think, because recently, as you see, Russia, North Korea, they had a summit talk. They met in Pyongyang. And also – that also has a lot of implication to Indo-Pacific area. Meaning that Russia is paying more attention to the region. So I think – and Korea is also feeling a lot of threat. And we need to prepare a lot for that, to respond to this. So in this regard, Indo-Pacific – in the Indo-Pacific region I think our two countries need to cooperate further. And among such cooperation that, I think, will include defense industry cooperation, like because we share a lot of ecosystem based on such interoperability.
I think on key components and others, we can do more mutual support going forward, and we can have a sharing system. And also on diverse weapon system, Korea has a lot of advantages and benefits. And also U.S. has its own benefits and advantages. We can combine these benefits so that we can go for a success in this area. So more than ever, such a stable cooperation in defense industry and also stable supply chain establishment are important. And cooperation of the two countries in this regard is very important. And we need to find out areas for potential cooperation going forward. And I think this conference will be the beginning point for that.
Hon. Bush: So, Dr. Cook, if I could, and Minister Seok, that last point about working together more on maintenance and repair. So that’s not the part of acquisition that often gets as much attention. It’s not as flashy as buying and developing new weapon systems. But it’s actually where the big money is. For the United States, 70 percent of the cost of most weapons systems is in sustainment, repair, and maintenance over time. Anything we can do in theater with the Republic of Korea to reduce those costs for the United States is, of course, beneficial from that regard for the U.S. Army and our other services, but it has that terrific side benefit, though, of increasing our depth of commonality in terms of repair parts, being able to work together, battle damage and repair, as the minister was stating.
So I think that’s an area that probably needs more attention. And it’s an area where it’s in some ways easier to cooperate, because you’re doing maintenance on new weapon systems – or, maintenance on existing weapon systems, often when we’re operating the same ones. So there is great benefit potentially there, both to save money but also to achieve all the goals that the minister was outlining.
Dr. Cook: Can you offer any sort of broader reflections on that key point, with regard to the regional sustainment framework and that new policy?
Hon. Bush: Absolutely. So where we’ve done it successfully around the world the benefits are manifest. First of all, local defense industries and our partner nations benefit from having work experience fixing U.S. equipment. All that sets the stage, for example, for being ready for war. We have a lot of those arrangements in Europe. For example, with Poland, one of our big allies there, and with Germany. But we want – we should be able to clearly be able to do more of that with our allies in the Indo-Pacific, in particular with Republic of Korea.
So that’s why I wanted to emphasize that that point is probably really ripe for more work. Because you get kind of best of both worlds and you’re really preparing for combat. If we are fighting there, we are going to have to repair equipment in a sustained conflict. Being able to do that and having practice doing it – from ship repair to aircraft, for example – is really kind of a combat rehearsal. That increases deterrence and increases readiness. So there are – there are many benefits, not – including saving money.
Dr. Cook: So I am tracking 100 percent. I have appreciated that, you know, as unfortunate as Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine is, it has illuminated and resulted in investments in some industrial base challenges. Are you seeing any insights – similar insights with regard to logistics, with regard to maintenance, repair, overhaul, et cetera?
Hon. Bush: Well, the importance in a – I really am not a fan of the term “contested logistics.” I would just call that war. (Laughter.) The importance of having things forward with our allies on the ground in place, rather than having to rely on very long supply chains back to the United States – especially in a conflict. Building up those stocks, repair parts, repair capability, ammunition stores is both deterrence but also would help overcome fighting a sophisticated enemy who attacked our supply chains and our – and our supply routes.
So, again, it’s really a win-win. And it helps ensure that we have things right there where we need it on the ground, not kind of just in time arrival, you know, kind of – you know, a concept that we should just wait to do it till the conflict starts. You can’t wait. You have to do it now. You have to practice it. And that logistics cooperation is as essential a part of preparing for war as training together on how to fight.
Ms. Cook: Minister Seok, I’d like to open the floor to you to follow on with any thoughts on sustainment, on logistics. You have your threat, your clearest threat, right at your northern border. So, you know, the supply chains are not quite as long. But there may also be some insights and lessons that you have from that, along with thoughts on the RSF.
Min. Seok: Well, thank you. Well, actually, Republic of Korea and United States are strong alliance partners. And so far, it was mostly about, like, combined forces, like, training. And so it was, like, a limited time for joint training. So we didn’t really pay attention to maintenance. We didn’t have time, and, you know, space to do that, because it’s a very short period of time. We are starting with this prepared weapon, prepared resources, prepared military forces. We do this joint training. So we didn’t – we’re not really prepared for this long-term war, like Ukraine war. And we couldn’t really foresee that there can be this kind – we knew theoretically, but we couldn’t really feel that there can be such difficulties in maintenance and repair and operation.
But through the experience of Ukraine war, we now know that we do really have these local problems. So when we do have this combined operation, what are the things that we need to prepare? We’ve got a very important lesson on that. And also, each country, while they are all, like, are being ready with resources and other things in response to potential war, but when you actually have a battle the companies that are local cannot be fully prepared. They can be destroyed. They don’t have the full capability. So maybe it may not go as expected.
So as a result, what we see is that we have limited combat power in the end. So we have such challenges in the field. So this is not something that one country can handle alone. So maybe friend countries, allies, if they can share that together I think that way we will be able to complement our vulnerabilities. And also, I think we need to be quick on preparing such system. Like you said, well, United States armies and other forces, they come to Korean Peninsula doing the training when there is no, like. equipment or resources. Then if we can locally manage that MRO locally, then we can do it right immediately, begin that again.
However, if we need to – if you need to put that back to the United States and repair that and come back to the Korea, that would take a lot of time. So well, like, in terms of this protracted war and everything, I think we understand the importance of such, like, local MRO and other things. However, in this – like so far, however, I think it was kind of dwarfed by joint training and other important issues so far. So I think now on Indo-Pacific area and then also the Korean Peninsula, to make it more stable and safe, I think other than the joint training we also need to focus on, like, securing stable supply chain and cooperation system.
And for the security in the Indo-Pacific area and Atlantic region, it cannot be separated, according to our president. So Korea’s capability can contribute to the security in the Atlantic region, and exporting our weapons to Poland and et cetera is to prepare against a possible crisis in terms of a crisis there. And those materials can flow back into Korea later on. So the entire area in the world is networked. And if we can send intensive supply and support to the region that has a need for it, then the area will be further advanced through the cooperation of the ROK and U.S. And both country need to feel the sense of urgency in this area and need to make more effort. Thank you.
Dr. Cook: Direct response, Secretary Bush.
Hon. Bush: I would say I couldn’t agree more. I think the more American allies and the more of democracies that have advanced production capabilities and advanced systems they can share with our other allies – the minister mentioned Poland – that’s only a good thing. We need, again, an arsenal of democracies where everyone has advanced capabilities and we all can share in the burden of collectively defending our values. It has to be now shared. It’s not just the United States, nor should it be. It needs to be all of us working together, all of us with advanced capabilities. That’s success. That is – that is an opportunity. That is not a problem for the United States. That is only a benefit.
Dr. Cook: So that production web is key here, where it’s not just the U.S. at the lead, but it’s our allies and partners working together.
Hon. Bush: Absolutely.
Dr. Cook: Yeah. Minister Seok, I just want to applaud you for recognizing the new challenges that we see based on Russia’s war in Ukraine, including the unexpected length of the war and the fact that Russia is targeting Ukrainian weapons manufacturing locations. So this is a bit of a sobering thing to reflect on for a future fight. And it does remind us of the importance of this production web.
I’d like to follow on something that was raised in opening remarks about the Security of Supply Arrangement, which the U.S. and the Republic of Korea recently concluded. Are you starting to see benefits of that agreement for enabling cooperation and for the balancing of both countries’ immediate needs, that both of you highlighted? How are you seeing that in your – in your work? Has it realized itself yet, or is it a work in progress?
Min. Seok: (Through interpreter.) Yes. Earlier, Russia is attacking Ukraine’s manufacturer facility to weaken Ukraine’s operational capability. So it is natural for Russia to go for that. And that was very expected behavior by Russia. So these production base, when these are destroyed we need to have a sustained production base to replace that. And we need allies and partners. We need to talk to them in advance, to share their supply chains before this crisis happens. And we can complement our vulnerabilities that way.
Regarding SOSA, so far we don’t have any specific or tangible results. And we need to work on it more going forward. In order to implement the arrangement, Korea is explaining more to our defense industrial bases, so that they can take advantage of it more going forward. At this stage, though, we don’t know what tangible benefits we are seeing. And it’s hard to answer that clearly. But we agree on the overall benefit and direction of the SOSA. And we just need to have a more implementation sort of strategy on that. Thank you.
Hon. Bush: So I think what that agreement – it’s the kind of framework agreement that highlights the deeper cooperation. One thing that comes to mind, though, and why you have to have such agreements, is fundamentally being able to do more between our defense industries requires sharing more information about our systems with each other. So the United States needs to be more open, frankly, with our key allies. That agreement is a part, an example of trying to do that, to where we are more comfortable sharing detailed information about our systems so we actually understand them fully and can cooperate more.
We are trying to – Department of Defense is trying to move from a, you know, approach where it’s kind of withhold information first, as our first instinct with our allies, to share information first. That needs to be where we start, and then we adjust from there, because this detailed information about our weapon systems is really the only way to actually get to the work on the ground, people turning wrenches, people repairing aircraft, building ships, working together. You can’t do that without a level of trust and an ability to exchange information. So I think that agreement is a part of a larger department effort to position us to share more information with our allies so we can do more things like this.
Dr. Cook: OK. Thank you. Minister Seok, I hope you are seeing an increase in these signs of trust from the United States when you work with us. So we just have a couple of minutes left. And in order to leave time for a round of applause, I would like to ask both of you if you have any final reflections, additional thoughts, comments on where you see the future of the partnership, and how you are working to help nurture it and make it grow.
Secretary Bush.
Hon. Bush: Sure, I can start. I think – so, you know, I am here just representing the U.S. Army. But we are already, again, deeply integrated already on the ground. Our industries need to be more integrated. Kind of like our militaries are very integrated, we need our defense industries to be integrated in the same way. I believe there is going to be more of that, simply kind of based on the power of the market. There are advanced companies in the Republic of Korea that have technology that we want to incorporate into our systems to make them better.
There is also, for example, manufacturing technology. You know, one of – you know, the Republic of Korea remains one of the world’s powerhouses of manufacturing. We need in the United States to learn from that. And as we try to rebuild a lot of our manufacturing capacity, we need to learn from and share technology from our allies who already are really good at that. So I think it’s not just buying each other’s things. As Dr. Hamre said, we got to move to the next level. I think the government role there is to facilitate cooperation. But at the end of the day, often our defense companies have to cooperate.
So that’s where us pushing from the government, creating forums for cooperation, letting our respective companies and defense industries just do what they do best, which is develop new technology, manufacture things at scale, and then do it in closer cooperation with each other. I think that will bear even more fruit than the existing strong government relationship. So I think – I think that is really the unexplored, or less explored, area that Dr. Hamre’s referring to, and Minister Seok was referring to, where we need to push more. But we need – we have a role in government in facilitating those things. We have to help our defense companies work together to do more, from production to maintenance and repair, as the minister stated.
Dr. Cook: Thank you.
Minister, you have the last word.
Min. Seok: (Through interpreter.) Based on a very strong alliance between the two nations, we share many values and we agree that we share those values between the two nations. So for us, we need to think about what we need to specifically do to materialize those values. Of course, as I mentioned earlier, either with combined exercises or supporting for our companies, we need to have stable supply chains. And that is important. And we need to push for that direction. However, in doing so we still have subtle policy and cultural differences between the two nations. And we need to make compromises in those sectors for bigger cooperation. If we can do that, we can easily push for what we’ve envisioned.
As I said during my keynote, we always had the U.S. by our side, and we were able to achieve the free democracy thanks to the U.S. And as a member of global community, we would like to do our responsibility. And we would like to contribute our capabilities to U.S. strategies and materializing those strategies of the United States. So in that sense, all the discussions we had will be able to materialize what we think. But time is not on our side. So we need to really move fast.
And I’ve been talking about the U.S. systemic issues and our differing opinions, and how to eliminate these obstacles between the two nations. And if we can discuss more and compromise more, and we can think of each other more, then we will be able to achieve what we want to achieve. And if we can do that, we’ll be able to materialize our Indo-Pacific strategies, and both nations will be able to play a proper role in the region. And I really hope that we can cooperate together in that aspect. Thank you.
Dr. Cook: Thank you very much for that inspiring statement.
We are now at time. And I would – we have a short break coming up. First, I would like to ask for a round of applause for our panelists. (Applause.) Thank you.
(Break.)
Gordon Lubold: Good morning, everybody. Hi. My name is Gordon Lubold. I’m a reporter with The Wall Street Journal. I cover national security and foreign policy here in Washington. And I’m delighted to moderate today this great panel. I think what we’re going to do is have some brief opening remarks from the two good folks on my left, and then presentations kind of a little bit more from the other three. We’re here really to talk about, broadly, U.S.-ROK relations, but particularly in terms of aligning industrial bases and kind of maximizing the alliance to help both sides in this age of competition. We can get into more stuff later. And I think we’ll have some opportunity for questions from the audience later, and I have some questions. But I think we’ll start here.
Jed, yeah.
Jedidiah P. Royal: Gordon, thank you so much. Hopefully the mic is working OK, you can hear me all right. Thank you, first, to CSIS and to DAPA for continuing this relationship, continuing to bring us together to talk about these really important issues. We really appreciate that in the Pentagon. We get a lot of insights out of these engagements. And so I’m sure we’ll have much to take back after hearing from my panelists – my fellow panelists today. Great to be here with all of you.
Earlier this month at the Shangri-La Dialogue Secretary Austin talked about a new convergence in the Indo-Pacific that’s leading to a more resilient and more capable network of partnerships. This developing network of partnerships is emerging in a deliberate and purposeful manner that is all about solving key problems.
In some cases, we may face an interoperability problem, so we’re designing exercises to improve the connectedness of our militaries. Or it might be a problem of awareness, so we are fielding equipment and software to our partners so they can better see what is moving in and out of the exclusive economic zones or their own territorial waters. Or it might be a problem of capacity, so we’re looking to improve co-production with partners, and we’re designing our security assistance programs to close key military gaps. So what you are seeing with this new convergence is a very practical, tactile implementation in the form of force posture agreements, multilateral exercises, improved interoperability, and beyond.
At the very core of this is a foundation and a commitment to collaboration. We know that collaboration is the answer, and the defense industrial base is no different. Strengthening resilience in our supply chains collectively will undoubtedly further invigorate the potency and durability of our defense relationships. So one thing you may have heard in Secretary Austin’s speech at Shangri-La is the U.S. endorsement of a multilateral statement of principles for Indo-Pacific defense industrial base collaboration. The principles that he sketched out have some really defining characteristics.
One, we need to put resilience at the top of the list. That maybe has not been the frame that we have used in recent years past, or even recent decades past. That needs to be at the top of the list going forward. Two, we need to understand and empower the comparative advantages of those who desire to partner together for this goal of defense industrial resilience. Our partners have a lot to offer, and it will be important to tap into those natural advantages they have. So we need to explore those, understand them, and then employ them. And three, we need to capture the incredible opportunities associated with developments in academia, commercial enterprises, and scientific advances. This approach will guide future bilateral and multilateral defense projects, including through greater research and development collaboration and by finding new sources of materials, processing, refining, assembly, and even maintenance.
Twelve nations have now endorsed those very same principles, and they’ve also agreed to establish a contact group for defense industrial base resilience focused on the Indo-Pacific. My team and our partners in the acquisition and sustainment group at the Pentagon have been working closely together on this project. We’re calling it the Partnership for Indo-Pacific Industrial Resilience, or PIPIR for short. Always need a good acronym. And we’ll be sharing lessons learned and best practices with one another on this multilateral level. But most importantly, we will talk about emerging opportunities to improve the strengths of our industrial bases.
Our goal with these efforts is to unlock these new sources of supply, as well as manufacturing and engineering talent of this pivotal region in ways that will support the United States, our allies, and our partners. This will increase purchasing power of the U.S. defense budget, provide greater assurance in critical supply chains, and drive improved readiness. And just as importantly, it will further embed the new convergence already happening in the Indo-Pacific in increasingly practical ways.
That’s a bit of a long wind-up to make one key point: The U.S. and the South Korean partnership is absolutely foundational to the success of the entire region. And that’s true both on a bilateral and on the multilateral level. Both are critical to meet our own military requirements and to improve the conditions for security in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. And the U.S.-ROK alliance has made recent strides in this effect, particularly with the security of supply arrangement that we signed last year. The SOSA, as we call it, will help mutually reinforce our supply chains to get defense resources that our forces need very quickly and very efficiently.
Streamlining close industrial cooperation and enhancing the alliance’s standing as a high-end security partnership also allows us to support the ROK’s vision to increase its contributions in the Indo-Pacific and as a global pivotal state. Sustained partnership with a technological and manufacturing powerhouse like the ROK allows us to sustain our domestic defense production here in the United States.
And the work we’re doing with the ROK exemplifies how we are working hand in hand with allies and partners across the Indo-Pacific and beyond to build a dynamic, innovative, resilient, and productive defense industrial base. For decades, the United States has been the world’s most dependable partner of choice for defense development. Work like this is about keeping it that way and improving the Indo-Pacific for future generations across the board.
Gordon, I’ll leave it there. Thank you very much. Look forward to our fellow panelists.
Mr. Lubold Thanks, Jed. Thanks so much.
Stacie.
Stacie Pettyjohn: OK. Thank you so much to CSIS for inviting me here, and Dr. Cook. It is a pleasure to be on this panel.
I’m going to step back and sort of broaden the aperture a little bit in terms of explaining how we got in this situation where we are today, where industrial base cooperation is so important and so critical, and why we’re unprepared for the threats that we face in the modern world. And part of this is we ended up being lulled into complacency in the United States, I think, after the Cold War ended. And we ended up not producing as many weapons as we needed, and we underestimated the intensity of modern warfare.
And what we’ve seen with Ukraine and in other places in the world is that high-intensity conflicts consume an enormous amount of material, especially munitions. As the international community has tried to support Ukraine, it’s become clear that our existing stockpiles are too low and that our defense industry cannot surge to meet the demand, even collectively. Therefore, one of the areas that I’m going to argue that we need to really focus on is precision-guided munitions, and munitions more generally. The other is drones, which is another topic near and dear to my heart. I just released a report last week, “Swarms Over the Strait,” and had one previously on Ukraine. And I think these are two areas where our industrial bases could collectively work together to help to improve both countries on the commercial technology side, as well as the military-specific technology side.
So how did we get here? You know, the Cold War ended. We had the brief, brilliant war in the Middle East with Operation Desert Storm against Iraq when it invaded Kuwait. And this convinced everyone that we had technological superiority, and that you could use better capabilities, these precise weapons, to have outsized effects. And that we’d be able to win very quickly. And that you could win without actually having to defeat another country’s army. And that’s proven not to be true. If countries decide to fight, they can dig in for a long time, especially if they’re great powers. And that is what the United States is focused on preventing from happening by preparing for it today.
So as the U.S., with the 2022 National Defense Strategy, really highlighted the threat from China and then the acute threat posed by Russia, while recognizing persistent challenges like North Korea, Iran, terrorism. And is centered on finding a way to deepen integration, not just across domains and within our own forces, but with allies and partners. And a key part of this is industrial base cooperation. And I think it needs to go beyond where we have been in the past in terms of simply having co-production agreements where we assemble weapons in each other’s countries. We need to think about how we can leverage each other’s strengths, compensate for each other’s weaknesses, and also strengthen our supply chains instead of stretching them.
And this will deepen our interdependence, but we’ve seen that we need to do this. You look at the world today – my boss and a colleague, Richard Fontaine and Andrea Kendall-Taylor, had an article in Foreign Affairs recently about the “Axis of Upheaval.” You’re seeing that aggressive states like Russia, North Korea, and China are cooperating. And that they are supporting each other in ways. So we need to actually – those who are opposed to aggression – support each other in very concrete ways.
We need to revise our planning assumptions in terms of what our requirements are for weapons going forward, whether they be PGMs, whether they be drones. And we need to really begin investing in them, because one of the things that we found that we need to be able to do, and where weapons technology has moved, is that precision – let’s see if I can talk – precision is now widely available. That’s what you’re seeing in Ukraine with drones. Cheap commercial drones are allowing the Russians and the Ukrainians to have very precise effects with unguided artillery. This is true across the world. We face problems with the Houthis in the Middle East and the Red Sea and the Iranian attacks. And these allies are trying to sap our inventories of air defenses, which are another type of key missile that we need to be investing in.
So going forward, I really like this PIPIR, this resiliency idea that Jed mentioned. I think there’s a dramatic need for deepening co-development of new technologies, co-production of existing weapons, so that we can meet the demand for countries in the world right now, spanning different regions for weapons that are being used in Ukraine, but also the types that might be needed in the Indo-Pacific, and then shared sustainment. This is an area that’s getting increasing attention but is incredibly important when you think about increasing the availability of different weapon systems. And also really strong signal of combined resolve that will strengthen deterrence and give any of the states that might aggress pause to think about it, hopefully so they never go down that route.
So I’ll end there.
Mr. Lubold: Great. Thanks for those framing remarks. It really does help us to kind of get our heads around why we’re here today, and what we want to talk about.
Scott, I believe you have your – our first presentation. You could get the clicker and I guess – yeah, so we can look at it over – OK, hopefully.
 Scott A. Sendmeyer: First, thank you for the opportunity to come today and speak about our department’s first National Defense Industrial Strategy. I think my colleagues did a great job setting the stage for why we needed this document and the need for, as we’re saying, just establishing a guiding vision for our national defense industrial base. I worked in the office that was responsible for publishing and drafting and then – drafting and publishing this document. It was a pretty ambitious endeavor that we set out on last summer and we were able to publish this January. And we currently are working on the implementation, which I’ll talk about a little bit later on.
So as I mentioned, you know, really all about taking the things that we were already doing, guiding those things that we’re going to be doing into the future when it comes to the industrial base, and then setting out what we thought were the most important aspects that we needed – the most urgent need of attention in our – in our defense industrial base. Intended to be very comprehensive in nature, in that it’s not just the department. It is the entire enterprise.
We’re looking at this to be a three-to-five-year timespan for this document, roughly. Of course, aligned well with our budgeting and resourcing processes. I will say also nested very well underneath the National Defense Strategy, especially in the building enduring advantage portion. Really put lots of thought into how we enable those enduring advantages that are identified there, and then build on the idea that we can’t do this alone. It’s going to take cross government, cross international partners, our allies and partners, Congress, to accomplish the goals that we set out here.
And part of it was also really trying to change the dynamic of the relationship between the department and industry from a very transactional. Say, this is about a partnership amongst us in industry. It’s a partnership between our partners and allies’ industries. And that’s the way we can receive the – we can reach the point of resiliency, capacity, and responsiveness that’s needed in our defense industrial base. As I mentioned, I’ll briefly talk to implementation at the end of the brief.
Quickly, just to take you through. You know, Stacie did a great job highlighting some of the growing challenges that we’ve identified and the atrophy that occurred to our defense industrial base over the past several decades. And that was really the focus of where we ended up on the four priorities that we did – namely resilient supply chains, the workforce readiness, flexible acquisition, and economic deterrence. From there, I’m going to take you through each of the priorities, but the idea was then to identify what actions are needed in the near future to counter those challenges and reduce that risk, and then also how we would then go forward in identifying what are the most pressing matters to inform resourcing decisions for the department as we move forward.
So, quickly, just an overview of the four priorities. I’ll give you a moment to read that. But while you’re doing that, what I’ll say is these are in no specific order. We kind of see these as equally and – equal in importance. However, we’re very cognizant of the fact that achieving effects in each of these priorities is probably not operating on the same timeframe. You know, probably can make relatively quick progress in resilient supply chains. A lot of work to be done there, but action being taken already is making progress there.
Whereas workforce readiness is probably more of a generational problem. It’s going to be needing to be solved both domestically for us but also, as you heard our Republic of Korea counterparts say this morning, they have their own workforce challenges. And transitioning that workforce of the past, of those dirty, dark and dangerous jobs to the high-tech, high-end needs, the STEM needs that we have in our defense industrial base today.
So as I mentioned in each of the priorities we broke it down into discrete actions that were identified as needed in our – needed to achieve effects in these priorities. I will say, as – especially when it comes to resilient supply chains, as you heard Honorable Bush say this morning, you know, the Republic of Korea already is a substantial – is very substantial in its own right when it comes to its defense industrial base. And the contributions that we can make collectively between each other in this priority are probably the most applicable between the U.S. and the Republic of Korea.
One, just an extra capacity in that we can identify gaps in our – each of our supply chains, that we potentially could fill for one another. Two, Korea is unique in that it’s one of the other nations that has a national stockpile of strategic materials. So joint or combined planning, at least considerations for that stockpile planning. When it comes to diversifying the supplier base, especially on new production methods. You know, we need to take advantage of each other’s advantages in advanced manufacturing and apply those advantages across both of our defense industrial bases.
On the leveraging data analytics, I can tell you the department is extending substantial resources and time and doing a deeper dive into our supply chains. And there’s probably an element of collaboration and cooperation that could be gained there by shared understanding of each of our supply chains and the global supply chain writ large. You heard a lot of talk this morning between Minister Seok and Honorable Bush about the importance of our partnership, the expansion of production, and the increased resiliency across our defense industrial base and our military weapon systems.
I would argue you can almost – it would be rough to – it would be tough to find a more compatible, more interchangeable, more interoperability between your services and our services. And I think the opportunities to expand that even further are easily there, which goes into the foreign military sales process. You know, great, great opportunity for expansion of that, both from foreign military sales perspective, but also in direct commercial sales.
On the workforce readiness, won’t spend a whole lot of time here, but what I will offer is, you know, although this is very much domestically focused in our strategy, there’s nothing to be said that we could not take lessons learned, best practices across both of our industries, and apply those into each other’s defense industrial bases. Just to highlight a few of the items that we’re looking to do internally, you know, really a promotion of those industrial careers, making people understand that, you know, to be successful you don’t necessarily need a college degree.
And there’s great opportunities in our defense industrial base. And that’s at the manufacturing level, but also all the way up to the advanced engineering and innovation levels. And that’s where that requirement for those STEM requirements comes out. So great efforts being done in terms of increasing our apprenticeships, both from the department perspective but also working with industry to support and expand their apprenticeships programs. And then really focusing on nontraditional communities and recruiting into the defense industrial base to meet the workforce needs of the future.
Moving over to flexible acquisition, I think there’s opportunities for collaboration and cooperation here, especially when you look at the strength and requirements and process curb at the top. So discussions on our part, in terms of as we develop our requirements for future weapon systems, or even modifications to existing ones, making sure that we’re bringing our partners and allies in early and that we’re building those requirements into that at the start rather than after the fact, where it’s much more difficult at times – and much more costly, for that matter.
It also then, on the back end, as you heard Honorable Bush say, when it comes to sustainment, building that in early also enables future sustainment of that. You heard me briefly talk about data – data analytics and expansion of data. So a lot of that is reliant on or dependent on the increased access to that data. It also goes to the point that they made earlier on intellectual property. And our ability to share and license that property is the only way we can really reach the production goals that are needed. (Coughs.) Excuse me.
And the last one I’ll speak to just briefly is on broadening the platform standards. This is really focused on the innovation side of the house, and very early on opening up the sharing of information and incorporating the best technologies into our systems as they’re being developed. And that can only be done through more collaborative intellectual property sharing and open architecture frameworks. Lastly, another area of relative opportunity when it comes to Republic of South Korea and the United States, and that’s on our economic deterrence front. What I also say on this priority is this is one that the department really sees as we are probably more reliant on our other partners than internal to the department ourselves.
Yes, we can do things internally, and are already doing things internally, but we’re really reliant on the interagency and then those collaborative efforts across our allies and partners to ensure that we’re, you know, establishing enforcement standards when it comes to adversarial capital, potentially adopting shared prohibited sourcing policy. As you heard them speak this morning, none of us want to have adversaries on our supply chains. And we need to reinforce that mutually between us. Really trying to press for greater involvement of the U.S. in standard setting bodies, especially when it comes to AI, space, and communication. And then lastly, you know, expanding on our agreements when it comes to economic security agreements. You know, the SOSA that we discussed earlier is just the start of those opportunities.
So as you heard me mention earlier, this is really all focused on the idea that we’re trying to buy down risk in our industrial base. We’ve identified 25 actions against the four priorities. And if you’ve read the strategy, there are a multitude of risks that we’ve identified that are threats to our industrial base. And as we develop our assessment framework for the strategy, that’s what this is really focused on, is how do we mitigate those risks and what are the measurements of both performance and effectiveness that we need to look towards to make sure that we’re making progress towards these priorities?
And as I mentioned before, on implementation. So we have been working since publication on developing implementation for the strategy. In the very near future, you’re going to see a release that basically looks from time now backwards of the things the department has been doing already and is continuing to do that support the strategy. Following that, later this summer you’ll see a version – an unclassified version of the implementation plan for the strategy that takes all the efforts that are ongoing across the department, the services, the interagency, and industry, and demonstrates how they are complementary to one another while also identifying how we’re going to assess that progress moving forward.
So, again, thank you for the opportunity to talk about our strategy. I look forward to your questions.
Mr. Lubold: Tremendous. JinA, please.
JinA Park: Good morning, everyone. I’m JinA Park, director of Defense Industry Advancement Support Division at DAPA of ROK. I didn’t expect to visit Washington D.C. again after my family trip about two years ago, but I’m thrilled to be back in this gorgeous city, even though this is for a different purpose this time.
It’s truly an honor to be here today and give a presentation. I will discuss the measures for Korea-U.S. cooperation to stabilize the supply chain of weapon system parts. The presentation will cover the following topics: Trends related to supply chain stabilization, and mutual efforts between Korea and the U.S. to stabilize weapon system supply chains, and, lastly, enhancing support for the entry of Korean SMEs into the global weapon system supply chain.
The first part is trends related to supply chain stabilization. OK. In recent years, the stabilization of global supply chains has become a critical issue, due to various factors such as COVID-19, the Russia-Ukraine war, and Israel-Palestine conflict. In high-tech fields like semiconductors and core materials, we are experiencing competition in technology and production capabilities, so we often face supply demand instability or imbalance in this advanced technology sector. Additionally, there is an emerging need to build environmentally sustainable supply chains as a measure against climate change. For these reasons, supply chain issues are increasingly becoming a matter of national security, beyond just the economic necessity.
The United States, under the Biden administration, immediately implemented measures to inspect the supply chain of core manufacturing industries. The report concluded that resilient, diverse, and secure supply chains are necessary for national security across several major U.S. industries. Based on these findings, the U.S. is promoting various supply chain policies to expand the supply bases domestically and with allied countries for advanced technology industries.
Since Japan’s export restriction on semiconductor materials to Korea in 2019, Korea has been continuously strengthening the competitiveness of materials, parts, and equipment industries. We have enacted laws such as Basic Supply Chain Act and are managing items essential to economic security. In addition, the government has selected 12 national strategic technologies for intensive investment. These are semiconductors and displays, secondary batteries, advanced mobility, next-generation nuclear power, and so forth. The government plans to invest a substantial budget in these fields over the next five years. On the defense side, we are also fostering companies in these high-tech, strategic industries as well. I will provide more details about this later.
The next part is mutual efforts between Korea and the U.S. to stabilize those weapon systems supply chain. In November last year, Korea and the U.S. signed SOSA. We have agreed to mutually prioritize and support industrial resources for the stabilization of supply. chains between the two countries. If one country requests a priority for a specific contract, the other country will directly grant priority or ensure that the contracting company fulfills the priority request. Korea is also taking necessary measures to implement the SOSA agreement with the United States.
Moreover, following the joint statement of the RDP-A MOU in May 2022, Korea and the U.S. are discussing the signing of RDP agreement. This agreement is expected to lead to rationalization, standardization, and improvement in interoperability through mutual opening of Korea-U.S. defense procurement market. Despite concerns in Korea about opening our defense procurement market to the U.S., which is superior defense technology, cooperation is needed in a way that can expect fair mutual benefits, not only through mutual trade but also by promoting joint development and production to form a reliable supply chain.
Furthermore, we are continuously working toward the third-generation defense cooperation, which include joint development, production, and marketing between Korea and the U.S. An example of this cooperation can be seen in the development of a hypersonic missile defense system in the United States, while Korea simultaneously develops related materials and component level products. Together, we can produce an integrated system and even conduct marketing efforts to third countries. As I know, we will propose another project of this type of cooperation in the next session, to be held in this afternoon.
Korean companies are also participating in the U.S. foreign comparative testing, FCT program, with recent selections, including LIG Nex1 guided rocket for a manned surface vehicle in 2022. We hope to see more Korean companies in high-tech strategic industries, including in the FCT program through ongoing collaboration. This picture shown here is from the 2022 FCT team to Korea. DAPA is strengthening the investigation and management of the weapon system supply chain, so we implement annual investigation of weapons system supply chain and build an alarming system based on the information of parts supply chain.
Also, we are promoting the cutting-edge industrialization of the defense industry to prepare for the future battle environments. We have selected AI, drones, robotics, semiconductors, and space technology, as the five major fields of high-tech strategic industries for intensive cultivation. We provide systematic support from entry into the defense field to product development, certification, testing, and marketing, aiming to develop world-class defense SMEs. This picture describes five major defense high-tech strategic industries to prepare for the future battlefield. And the next picture shows the support measures by the Korean government for each stage of business growth of defense SMEs.
Lastly, this diagram illustrates various support programs by the Korean government to assist the defense SMEs in entering domestic or international weapon system supply chains. The last part is enhancing support for the entry of the SMEs into the global weapon system supply chain. The Korean government is supporting the enhancement of technical capabilities and product competitiveness of SMEs, so that technologically advanced Korean parts or component can participate in the supply chains of global system companies. Then SMEs can export their own products worldwide. Meanwhile, the government provides SMEs with information about global system companies and utilizes the offset obligation of foreign system companies contracted with the Korean government. This would also help our SMEs enter global supply chain.
The GVC 30 project is a new initiative being undertaken by DAPA and carried. We analyzed the competitiveness of Korean SMEs weapon system parts, components, or equipment in 15 technological field, while also examining the supply chains of global defense companies to support the matching of mutual cooperative companies. By utilizing the Global Biz Matching System developed by KRIT, we will analyze and match companies and then create opportunities for Korean companies and global system companies to meet and conduct detailed discussions through events like Global Matching Day.
Based on this, we aim to support the development of parts or components by Korean companies and facilitate their participation in the global supply chain by utilizing the offset trade system. The Korean government plans to assign a higher value multiplier to the offset trade in this case, compared to others. A considerable number of U.S. companies would be included in these global system companies. Through this project, we expect to nurture globally competitive parts companies and contribute to stabilization of supply chains in both countries. We request your interest and support for mutual cooperation with the GVC 30 companies supported by the Korean government.
We seek your assistance in reviewing the technologies or products of GVC 30 companies and arranging opportunities for discussions on their participation in the supply chains of U.S. defense companies. Additionally, we request that Korean companies be considered for participation in the U.S. Defense Industrial Base Consortium, the IBC, to undertake joint project. We hope that the partnership between companies from both countries will enhance mutual defense capabilities and contribute to strengthening supply chains. Furthermore, if you could set up a Korean pavilion and provide promotional opportunities, such as participation in the local programs at AUSA, for introducing the GVC 30 project and enhancing defense cooperation between our two countries.
This is a diagram of showing the booth layout at Sea Air Space Exhibition, to show the Australian booth as an example. And these two pictures show many programs run at AUSA. We hope to see many Korean and U.S. companies meet and communicate in this wonderful setting, fostering close cooperation for a stable and resilient weapon System supply chain. It’s all I prepared for my presentation. Thank you for listening.
Mr. Lubold: That’s tremendous. Thank you so much, JinA. Han, if you would then go. And just please, and I think just so we have enough time to get a few questions in, if you could try to keep it a little bit short, and so we can get through it and make our 12:30 deadline. Thank you.
 Han Seung Jae: (Through interpreter.) Thank you. I am Sung Jae Han. As many people have emphasized, cooperation and resilience is very important. Because of the Ukrainian war, that requires a lot of consumption of weapons, and fast delivery was more difficult than expected. Well, historically, when there’s a collision among powerful nations, usually the war was very protracted. The First World War was more than 50 months, and Second World War also was 60 months and over. So if we predict such warfare, I think the bottleneck will only intensify. On the other hand, China and Russia, these rival nations of the United States, they are also going through similar pain points. So if – in this liberal bloc – if we do have enough stockpile, and if we are ready to use them, I think we can have deterrence effect. So in a nutshell, I would say that capacity equals deterrence.
If I talk about Russia-Ukrainian war, advanced weapons, including drones. are actively leveraged. But you can also see that not just advanced technologies from new technologies, actually the production capability is becoming more important. In the beginning, Ukraine seems to be on the superior side because of the technological advantage. However, as time goes by, Russia also fastly adopted drone technology. As a result, now the two sides are having drone production capability competition. So the production capability, having advantage on that, is still very important under this era – in this era of advanced technology.
At the same time, for the security of the United States going forward, we think production capability will stay important. Republic of Korea, we are aligned with such strategic interests of the United States. In all areas, we are one of the partners that have the interoperability. So I think it is time for us to improve our cooperation between bilateral industries, going further so that we can close the gaps in security. For this goal, the two countries, I think, have some potential ideas.
First idea is having institutional cooperation. In 2023, we signed SOSA. So we need to designate the companies that will implement that. And also, secondly, I think we need to have more customized G2B cooperation. So RDP-A or SOSA, through such we can have more fast and effective implementation of that. Recently, the two country FCT program, we have cooperation projects to intensify the depth of our cooperation.
However, I think we have room for further intensification. Recently United States, DIBC OT system and also the DIO and Singapore Defense Ministry arrangements are good cases in point. And also Korea, DIBC OT is – wants to be one of the DIBC countries. And also we are willing to cooperate – intensify our cooperation in this regard. Such system will exempt Korean companies from some barriers in participating in this market.
And also, lastly, we can have more cooperation fields. I think ally is about friends indeed and in need. So if you know what your friends are in need of, then your cooperation can intensify further. I think Republic of Korea, like I mentioned, there are five new areas that the Korean government is focusing on. Especially we have the Defense Company 100 Project, where we are nurturing more defense companies. NDIS by U.S., or NDSTS, if you look at those documents you can see that it overlaps a lot with the five major areas that Korean government is focusing on, which includes robotics, drone, and semiconductors.
The two countries, in order to have better cooperation, we need to expand our spectrum of cooperation. Recently, DOD NDS or NDIS, through such documents in defense cooperation, it emphasized the importance of partner and allied countries. I think that will be the foundation of national competitiveness. And also, it will be a good way to have deterrence against risk from enemies. Like President Roosevelt said, every machine, every arsenal, every factory. He said that. So all the defense companies need to exercise its full potential, so that the United States can play the role of arsenal of democracy.
I think we need to add every alliance as well to his saying. Alliance is, I think, similar to football games. You need to play your role sincerely. Only then you can have success. I think the ROK-U.S. alliance, through such close cooperation, like in football, like Jerry Rice and – (inaudible) – you know, we need to have such co-working. If we can do that, I think we can have stronger alliance even. Our institute will do our best so that the bilateral industries can be flourished, based on our support. And also we’ll make sure to have the supply chain that is reliable and trustworthy, based on which we hope that our alliance will go – become more robust. Thank you.
Mr. Lubold: How about we – I would like to just kind of ask a broader question that touches on everything that I think everybody’s talked about a little bit, but Stacie and I were talking a little bit earlier. Is, how do you – how do you deepen the defense and industrial base relationship between the two countries, but also allow competition to flourish? As some of you alluded to, you know, obviously South Korea has a robust competition and sells a lot of exports, a lot of weaponry and the like. The U.S. needs some of that, as we saw with the purchase of the ammunition for Ukraine recently. But basically, how do you deepen and also navigate competition?
Dr. Pettyjohn: Oh, I didn’t realize I set myself up for that.
Mr. Lubold: You did. You totally did.
Dr. Pettyjohn: But it’s not an easy question that I have a clear answer to. But I think, you know, we both have, and fully support, having the private sector being strong. And competition is a key part of that. I do think there needs to be some discussion at higher levels of government about whether there are different roles and responsibilities, like we were talking about in certain areas, and maybe aligning certain markets and certain capabilities, and saying that’s going to squarely be the focus of what you’re doing, and we’re going to focus over here, so we don’t duplicate too much.
Though resilience is important and does require redundancy, right now, it just seems like the need is so great that everyone can actually do well because there are so many countries out there who are trying to bolster their defenses because they realize that they hadn’t prepared adequately, given the magnitude and scale of the threats that we face globally.
Mr. Lubold: JinA, do you want to try to answer the same question? How do you navigate – how do you deepen the relationship, while also navigating natural competition between the two countries?
Ms. Park: (Through interpreter.) First of all, in order to do cooperation, I think it’s important to know each other. While in Korea, with GVC 30 project, we are leveraging Global matching – Biz Matching system developed by the Institute. Through that, we are trying to see the competitiveness of our companies and evaluate that. And we’re also trying to see what the global weapon systems are in need of. So we’re analyzing the needs as well. So we’re looking at two pillars together to match the supply and demand. So our government is trying to do that. So the two sides need to be able to know what are each other’s competitiveness and what are the needs of each other. Only then I think we can have more proper direction in our cooperation.
Mr. Lubold: Jed, can you just kind of give us a couple, like, practical examples of what you see as more of this deepening relationship? I’m really kind of struck by the opportunity potentially for American ships to get more maintenance there. The tyranny of distance is very clear in that region, as you well know. But that’s just one example. But what should people think this looks like, as it deepens?
Mr. Royal: Yeah, thanks. Maybe I’ll just touch on the previous question briefly as well, which is that I don’t think we want at all to minimize the – all the benefits we get through competition, fair market competition. That will continue to be the case. I think the question for us is, has that fully provided for all of the requirements that we have, given the recent history of international insecurity that we’re facing? And there, the question is, can governments apply the same level of organization, and orchestration, and commitment that we that we have in the strategic space, in the political space, and the policy space, to the defense industrial space?
And I don’t think it’s actually much. I think a little bit of organization and orchestration actually has a – goes a very long way to simply accelerate what will naturally happen in the market anyway. And so if we get after these comparative advantages, understanding where one nation has a real opportunity to provide and where others have real needs, we can actually accelerate the way that that that marketplace naturally works over time. That’s really, I think, what we’re talking about here.
On the practical examples, thanks for bringing up sustainment. This is going to be a really important area going forward, in my opinion. Kudos and hats off to our acquisition and sustainment colleagues who have built a new regional sustainment framework. We know from working with U.S. Indo-Pacific Command that in this region we have a real operational requirement for forward sustainment. That’s on a variety of platforms and systems. And as we think about the character of competition as it unfolds, and also as we think about planning for crisis and conflict, where do we want hubs for sustainment of critical systems that will, in the very first case, impact deterrence – that’s what we’re after – but in the event of crisis or conflict, how are we able to rapidly sustain U.S. allied and partner systems that might require that?
So think ports of entry, embarkation and debarkation. We need to make sure that they have the kind of capabilities necessary for rapid sustainment. Air hubs, missile hubs, for sustainment. All of those things require a collective thinking and a mapping process of where physically, geographically, do you want those areas? And we know that Korea has some tremendous capability in this regard, that I don’t think the United States has fully taken advantage of. We need to be better at doing that and thinking our way through what Korea provides, again, not just for us and for Korean systems, but for others in the region as well. And vice versa. There will be other areas where we need to sort of think our way through this. So I think that’s a great area to think practically about this issue set.
Mr. Lubold: Han, do you have any view of, from your standpoint, about what this looks like? Kind of basically the same question I just asked Jed.
Mr. Han: (Through interpreter.) I also want to take one example. One of the thing I saw in the presentation is that the Korean companies, they have this unmanned rocket system developed. So we participated in the FCT program. I think LIG is participating in that. If you look at that background, you can see that in order for the United States to counter Chinese, you also need this unmanned version, so that they can respond to the firearms of Chinese, so then we can also counter the main vessels of China later on.
Usually, they call it, like, distributed maritime operation. I don’t know exactly in English. So you see, I think you need a lot of unmanned watercraft. It’s not only just to consume that. It also needs to have some power to combat LIG 2.75, this ground rocket is now – can be embedded in this unmanned watercraft and supplied to United States. I think that kind of cooperation is possible bilaterally.
Mr. Lubold: In a few minutes, I want to grab one or two questions from the audience. But, Scott, just I wondered if I could ask you to expand a little bit more on the resiliency issues. Nobody knew anything about this until COVID hit some years ago, and now we’ve got supply chain issues because of all these different conflicts, or whatever. But could you give us one example of a challenge in this regard? Like, I guess, kind of a specific example? And then how you briefly see kind of the road ahead to kind of deepen or strengthen that supply chain?
Mr. Sendmeyer: Yeah, I’ll try. So and I’ll try and incorporate a couple of the different priorities in, because I think it’s a decent example and it gets at the adversarial sourcing – the fact that we have global supply chains. We saw the challenges that came out of COVID-19, whether it be because of distribution or production. And frankly, as you just alluded to a few minutes ago, the demand is such that lead times are just growing longer and longer.
So a good example that we’re working through right now is, you know, we look to try and remove – a good example is rare earth element magnets – as we try to remove them out of our supply chains. An area that China has a dominance in the market on, low cost, relatively low risk to our systems in terms of integrity or confidentiality. But when it comes to availability, you know, at time of crisis – and you’re already seeing it now with some of the tariffs that they’re putting in place, or export restrictions – we’re being faced with greater supply chain restraint. And leveraging all those capabilities globally amongst our partners, who have some of the processing capabilities, potentially have existing mines that they’re already drawn out of that maybe those materials are being sold to China for processing.
You know, these are – these are long solutions that have to be put in place. But it gets to the solutions that we’re getting after, as Han mentioned, in terms of DIBC OTA, and that investment vehicle, to be able to target those investments towards the capabilities that are required to fill those gaps in the supply chain. Whether it be way down – way upstream in the supply chain, at the raw material, or even, as we were discussing earlier, at the component or part level and coproduction. It doesn’t have to be, you know, end-material, end-item coproduction. It could be component, where we have, Stacie mentioned a great example earlier, solid rocket motors. Where we have a clear need and a greater demand than we can meet. It’s a great opportunity for our partners and allies to fill those gaps. And, you know, the Republic of South Korea is well-postured to do so.
Mr. Lubold: Great. Can I open it up to the audience in our last few minutes here, or whatever? Who’s got a good question? Sir.
Q: I am – (off mic). I am the director of the North America cooperation division for the DAPA.
So, actually, the NDIS – I have a question for Scott Sendmeyer. Actually, NDIS is focused on the global resilient supply chain stability between the allies and friendly countries. So, as you mentioned in your presentation in advance, the U.S. will announce the NDIS implementation plan in summer. So I’m just wondering that you can find some detail, the specific area, the cooperation – industrial cooperation area between the U.S. and South Korea, or another country, in in the implementation plan.
Mr. Sendmeyer: I could try and point out few areas without, you know, letting the cat out of the bag. You know, of course it’s going to be organized under the framework of the strategy. So really working towards showing the complementary effects across these multiple programs that are ongoing in the department, and the demands that we’re putting on both industry and our partners and allies. The other aspect, I will say, is – and not giving it all away – but there are six implementation initiatives that the secretary and the deputy secretary have identified as the items that they see most pressing, urgent, must be addressed, and they expect our components to come back and tell them how we’re addressing them and how do we address them in the future.
To not go into strict detail, but you can, you know, understand that one of them would be focused on the INDOPACOM region, and what are the aspects and this the operational requirements that are needed – adjustment in the defense industrial base to meet those pressing needs? Areas that you see in the strategy but are echoed in the implementation in terms of greater cybersecurity of the defense industrial base. And not only our defense industrial base, but our partners and allies because if we expect to share greater intellectual property, we got to make sure that it’s assured protection of it. So those are just two examples that you’ll see. But honestly, within days you will probably see the – as I mentioned – the backward-looking report. No promises, but it’s already in staffing. And then towards the end of the summer, you’ll see the unclassified version published.
Q: Thank you.
Mr. Lubold: Anybody else have something burning they’d like to ask?
We’ll wrap up here in a minute. But I’d just – it’s kind of an obvious question – but I am interested in maybe brief responses from anybody who wants to jump in, but just, you know, the subtext of all this, as I say most recently, are of these conflicts, particularly Ukraine but also in Gaza. (Coughs.) Excuse me. What has – what has South Korea learned from those conflicts, in terms of the need to strengthen all the stuff that we’re talking about today? But what is – what have you learned in Seoul, in the context of those conflicts? JinA, go ahead.
Ms. Park: (Through interpreter.) Based on the recent conflicts, like, through relationship among allies and partners, we understand now that securing supply chain is very important. And also, at the same time, like, technological control among countries are also on the rise. We also realize that, and we now learn that we also need to be prepared for that. So among the allies, in cooperation of course they’ll put their interests as top priority. However, at the same time, we also need to share their own strength with each other, so that they can contribute to each other’s growth and development.
And under such circumstances, we think that we can have more synergy. And also we can have more broader perspective in this cooperation, to have more effective and faster progress. For example, in case of United States, in advanced areas United States have strength and South Korea not only technology, but also we do have strength in our production capacity. And also we do have some areas with technological strength. So if we can share that together, and for our cooperation, I think that will be great for our success. And I think that will be the right direction for cooperation. And we also need to be prepared for that. That’s one of the lessons we got.
Mr. Lubold: That’s actually a great way to conclude, but, I mean, anybody else want to jump in along those lines? Yeah, please.
 Mr. Sendmeyer: Maybe I’ll just endorse – fully endorse this comment. (Laughs.) Which is that the greatest lesson coming out of the conflicts we have is that friends matter, alliances and partnerships matter. Aggregation of political commitment all the way down to materiel issues, operational understanding, matters. And that has to be shared fluidly, quickly, responsively to any of the emergent crises that we face. And there’s a ton of lessons. Maybe just one more lesson, which I think came up earlier, maybe, Stacie, in your comments, was that mass still matters as well. So in the age of precision, in the age of innovation, mass still matters.
And so, how do we couple those that the – the precision and the mass – in a manner that really complicates the adversary’s defense calculations? And I think that’s really where we’re on the cusp of right now. When you combine the alliance and the partnership aspect with mass and innovation together, I think the opportunities are just really terrific – particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. And so we’re going to do everything we can to try and generate this in Washington’s instruments of power, the ability to go and prosecute those opportunities and get after them as quickly as possible.
Mr. Lubold: Sounds great. Please join me in thanking our panel. And everybody have a great day. (Applause.)

37,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/karim-elgendy-climate-diplomacy-middle-east,Unknown,"June 25, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"Jon Alterman: Karim, welcome to Babel.
Karim Elgendy: Thanks, Jon. Thank you for having me.
Jon Alterman: What role do you see climate playing in regional conflict? Peter Schwartzstein, the journalist, has a book coming out in the fall with the subtitle On the Front Lines of Climate Violence. Do we have to think about climate in terms of contributing to instability in the Middle East?
Karim Elgendy: Climate has been considered within academic and policy circles as a threat multiplier. However, this conversation has reached no conclusive evidence that climate is intrinsically a cause of conflict. In other words, there's no causality between climate change on the one hand and violent conflict on the other. The example that is often cited is the conflict in Syria. There's certainly no doubt that an increase in temperature and a drought in Northeast Syria led to the migration of subsistence farmers away from areas like Al-Hasakah and Raqqa towards the main urban areas further to the west in Homs, Halab, and Daraa.
This forced rural to urban migration resulting from the drought—which anecdotally was the worst drought Syria had experienced in the last 800 years, according to some estimates by NASA—has done two things. One, it has obviously relocated 800,000 people into new areas where they have no jobs. They have no skills. There are no services for them, and they also lost all their wealth because 85 percent of all privately owned cattle reportedly died.
Now, does that lead to conflict? Does that create enough instability? Does it create enough social discontent within those cities that they have moved to the outskirts of? That's still subject to debate. I would say there is some correlation between the currents of climate change impacts, specifically for the most vulnerable amongst us, but there is no causality.
Jon Alterman: How should we think about climate as an international threat to stability? Certainly, there's been increasing criticism of Turkey building dams and causing some of the drought in downstream areas, including Iraq. Is climate creating a Middle East that is more likely to have international conflict?
Karim Elgendy: If one looks at the literature from the last few decades in terms of the historical record of cases of collaboration between nation-states within the MENA region, and cases of conflict between them over those resources, one finds more cases for collaboration than cases for conflict. That suggests that there might be hope that nations in the region will come together and perhaps collectively overcome this particular challenge.
Climate change impacts will admittedly get worse, and this ability to collaborate in the face of such challenges will be something that we will have to wait and see. The other issue is that conflicts between nations are slightly different than conflicts within certain nations. Conflicts can sometimes overlay with certain schisms between sectarian parts of a country, say for example in Iraq or Lebanon where those sectarian fault lines do exist. Any overlaying of climate impact differentiation across those dividing lines could result in worsening sectarian relationships within those countries.
Jon Alterman: Do the different aspects of climate change, like water shortages, rising temperatures, and increasingly strong storms, including dust storms, affect things in similar ways? Do they work the same way and provide the same accelerant to alienation as well as possibility for international coordination, or are they different?
Karim Elgendy: It really all depends on how they affect specific economic sectors. The main challenges from climate change aren't always the primary impacts of climate change. It's sometimes the secondary and even the tertiary impacts of climate change. If you look across the MENA region, the main impacts of climate change are an increase in the maximum temperature in the summer and an increase in the variability of rainfall. In other words, you get longer droughts, but also, when it does rain, it will rain more intensely and lead to flooding. There is also a reduction in overall precipitation where it does rain, as in the Levant and in parts of North Africa like the Atlas Mountains. While in the Gulf, you get slightly more precipitation from obviously a very low base.
That means certain impacts on certain economic sectors. Tourism, for example, will be hit pretty badly because less water for tourist activities and worse environmental conditions, in terms of increased temperature, will not draw as many tourists. But the sector that will be affected most in terms of productivity is agriculture. Agricultural productivity dropping will be a real issue, not just in terms of food security, but also because a lot of countries depend on cash crops. They export high-value produce to other countries and then import their main staples in order to feed their own populations.
Those sectors being affected will lead to two things: obviously, it will lead to a loss of jobs, but it will also lead to a reduction in GDP. This is where it gets really interesting in terms of how these socioeconomic impacts then translate into political impacts within the same nation.
I wouldn’t look at them as one primary impact and how it can lead to conflict directly. Rather, I would look at this cascading of impacts altogether. However, having said that, there is one climate change impact, albeit very long-term, that could independently disrupt a few things. The rise of sea levels globally could potentially create some disruptions in terms of coastlines and island disappearance, and it could force certain countries to redefine exclusive economic zones.
So that could lead to potential disputes overfishing, mineral resource extraction, et cetera. The one example I would give here is from the Gulf. It has hundreds of small islands and if they disappear, then a re-delineation between the countries might be in order.
Jon Alterman: On the global side, you've written recently about the role that the Great Powers are playing in dealing with climate issues in the Middle East. How are they engaging in climate issues?
Karim Elgendy: So Great Power competition is certainly rising and in the Middle East specifically, there's this ""perceived"" withdrawal of the United States, and that has led to a number of players seeking more influence within the region. Whether that withdrawal is true or not, at least there's that perception.
Those Great Powers, specifically China and its Belt and Road Initiative, are trying to make forays. They're trying to have more influence within the region and in other regions around the world. And they do this by investing, providing technical support, and providing financial support for projects. As the project flows and finance flows have shifted towards less development aid and more climate aid or climate support, we're finding that climate has become one of those pawns and an infrastructure investment tool.
That is becoming more obvious in the case of the Global Gateway, which is a new infrastructure investment initiative by the European Union (EU), and the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), which is a U.S.-led G7 initiative. They both have climate at the core of what they want to do. They have it as one of their guiding lights, if you like.
However, after 10 years of operating the Belt and Road Initiative, last year there was a rethink. One of the current guiding principles of this new vision for the Belt and Road Initiative was to have a greener Belt and Road Initiative, which means more renewable energy projects and more investment into greener infrastructure.
I think that creates competition between those major players in areas that are currently devoid of any collective action, any partnership, or any shared vision over what climate action looks like and could result in more fragmentation because it leads to more fragmented action rather than collective action. If China comes in with its own tech, its own standards, and its own workers, then it will produce something in one country that is significantly different, and certainly not coordinated in any way, from a similar project that is done in the country next door and funded by the PGII or by the Global Gateway.
Jon Alterman: Certainly, you could have some countries building gas power plants, which are better than coal but do not have a much higher carbon impact than solar, wind, or something else.
Karim Elgendy: Absolutely, and we saw that initially before China did that revision in that some countries were inclined to follow where the money was. If China was providing a vision with no strings attached and with minimal climate action, then there were countries being forced to make that choice. If there was financing available from the Belt and Road Initiative and the terms were agreeable, then the question was, “Why do we bother with all these issues in terms of emissions associated with the projects and commitments by the EU or the U.S.-led PGII?”
However, now I think all of the infrastructure investment initiatives are basically moving in the same direction. They all see that the finance flows are going in that way, and many of the development projects now have a green color of some sort. 
Jon Alterman: You've been around all these climate conferences and seen climate diplomacy. Is climate statecraft different from regular diplomacy in your mind?
Karim Elgendy: Yes. In climate negotiations, statecraft is very present. Countries are there to protect their own interests in this new world and in this new economy which is being forged as we speak. But at the same time, this is a collective challenge, so there is a constant reminder for all of us that we're doing this for future generations. I don't think any of those who are in the negotiation rooms will live to see the impacts themselves.
But there's this higher responsibility that some of those countries and some of those negotiators do have towards future generations. We saw that when John Kerry, during the signing of the Paris Agreement, brought his granddaughter who sat on his lap as he was signing it. I think that was a gesture for all of us that this is for them.
Having said that, diplomacy and the use of climate to advance national interests are also always there. Countries use the goodwill that climate does provide to win friends, and you see that sometimes in certain investments. Even by medium powers trying to invest in more developing economies to advance their own interests and increase their influence.
Jon Alterman: But it also feels to me that in climate diplomacy the blocs are very different. There's a near-term cost and a long-term benefit. It feels to me like it requires a very certain kind of diplomat who won't be able to harvest the fruits of his or her efforts.
Karim Elgendy: The blocs are largely along the lines of developing versus developed, and the developed economies have always argued that they recognize that they have a bigger responsibility for historical emissions. But at the same time, they argue that if we don't work together, there's no way that climate action by only Europe, North America, and others can reverse the increase in carbon emissions in the atmosphere.
The emissions from China, for example, are too high for West-led action to be sufficient. However, on the other hand, the developing economies are arguing, ""Well, we haven't created this mess, and it shouldn't be upon us to bear the load when, in fact, we're trying to get to a kind of basic economic development that the West has enjoyed for decades, centuries.""
Jon Alterman: To the contrary, in many cases, they're arguing for loss and damage. That they be compensated for the consequences of climate change in their own countries, and that their transition to more environmentally sensitive technologies be subsidized by other countries.
Karim Elgendy: This whole argument over the delineation between the developing and developed was largely put to rest when the principle called the “common but differentiated responsibilities” was agreed to within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. What was agreed is that we will all work together, but we will work together in a voluntary way, as you can see in the Paris Agreement, where we collectively make sure that the temperature doesn't exceed two degrees, but ideally not 1.5 degrees—a goal which there is no chance we will meet at this point.
But at the same time, each and every one of us, countries or parties to the agreement, will do what we can. So, you add it all up and it doesn't add up right. It comes to three degrees. You add it all up and it comes to 2.7 degrees, and it has never bridged that gap between the collective action and the individual country action. This is the conundrum at the heart of climate governance today: that we can’t force any nation to do anything. We failed miserably in doing so in Copenhagen a few years ago. The Paris Agreement has got this fault at the heart of it, and it relies on shaming countries and lobbying.
One more point I wanted to mention, in addition to these two main groups, the developed economies and the developing economies, there are the low-lying islands. They are often a collective of countries that is deemed most at risk and that is lobbying for the highest level of ambition.
They, in a way, represent our conscious because they argue, for example, for the 1.5-degree limit rather than the 2-degree limit, because they are the ones who will see that impact most and will suffer from the consequences most. As a matter of fact, many of them will have to move. Kiribati recently bought land in Fiji for that reason.
Jon Alterman: But the third group of countries are energy producers, many of which are not in the Western-developed economy camp. Countries like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Middle Eastern countries that arguably have a greater interest in stability in the region but have their own view about how long the world should be using carbon fuels. How do they see climate diplomacy? How do they see regional diplomacy as it connects to climate diplomacy?
Karim Elgendy: On the Gulf producers’ position, there is a recognition that the world has decided that we move away from fossil fuels. Now, what does that transition look like? What does the curve look like in terms of demands and reduction of demand past the 2030s and beyond? That's subject to debate between the International Energy Agency, OPEC, et cetera. But certainly, the producers would like to make sure that there is a market for fossil fuels for as long as possible, and they make a strong economic and moral case for that.
They argue that their oil and gas is the cheapest per barrel for extraction. They also argue that their own extraction has the lowest carbon footprint compared to any other extraction, which is about a seventh of the total emissions of any given barrel. So, in a way, they would argue that they should be the last producer standing.
But from a diplomatic position, those countries place themselves within the context of the Paris Agreement and say that they're going to do their part. They have net-zero carbon goals by 2060 and 2050 in some cases. But at the same time, they want to make sure that they will continue producing. So, in a coincidence that can only happen in the Gulf, we have internal decarbonization, which releases more oil and gas that would have otherwise been consumed internally and is made available for export to the global market. It's being made available and pushed out, essentially, as fast as possible.
The other twist to this is that the money that is generated—this extra cash which is generated by releasing a few million extra barrels of oil from the Gulf into the global market—is then pumped back into the economy to fund a move away from fossil fuels. In other words, diversification and decarbonization.
So, we have this race against time where countries in the region are trying to decarbonize and diversify but pumping every drop of oil to fund that. In other words, oil has become a necessity and an urgent one to facilitate the existence of this region in a world where no oil is required.
Jon Alterman: The head of Aramco said last month that he expected that 80 percent of Saudi Arabia's markets will be in the Global South in 2050. Does that sound right to you, that the Western world is likely to decarbonize, but most people in the world will still have very carbon-intensive lives?
Karim Elgendy: There is that too, of course. So, on the one hand, demand from the Global North will decrease because there is a need for higher energy independence, as you see, for example, in the EU, which has reduced its use of gas significantly—20 percent in one year. But there's also an increase in population, urbanization, and standard of living expected in Africa and Asia. That might also contribute to this increasing demand for fossil fuels.
What those regions should really do is leapfrog this entire process and achieve energy security and greener growth by skipping over the fossil fuel stage, and moving directly into development that is built around renewable energy and energy efficiency.
Jon Alterman: Are Middle Eastern countries uniquely willing to sacrifice for climate goals because the region is more susceptible to climate change? Or is the Middle East typical in that, at this point, no government is really willing to make big sacrifices for climate goals?
Karim Elgendy: I would argue that there is no government in the world that is willing to make significant sacrifices for climate goals. The way climate governance works is every nation for itself. Only when countries realize that it's in their interest to join that bandwagon and to shape new rules for the global economy, rather than become a rule-taker a few years down the line, do they actually take real action. It's not a sacrifice. It's actually for their own political, geopolitical, and economic gain.
With the minor exception of some Scandinavian and European countries that consider their historical responsibility to be an additional driver for climate action and for fighting climate change, no nation actually does that. Despite the dire future that faces the Middle East and North Africa, the region has too many challenges that prevent it from actually sacrificing anything at this point. It hardly can make ends meet, let alone sacrifice current standards of living for future standards of living. There are too many fires in the region for it to think in that mindset.
Jon Alterman: Do you think there's an incident that could provide an inflection point for the region, or is that just unlikely?
Karim Elgendy: The more we see extreme weather events and the more it hurts, the more this could lead to an inflection point. For example, the economic calculation for investing in stormwater management in some Gulf cities was entirely revisited after an actual flood and urban flooding did happen, and it led to significant economic losses. So, this is when you start thinking about it. Perhaps we should consider climate more seriously because this is actually in our economic interest.
Jon Alterman: Karim Elgendy, thank you very much for joining us on Babel.
Karim Elgendy: Thank you.

Max Bergmann: Understanding the growing collaboration between Russia and Iran. That's the topic for today's conversation. I'm Max Bergmann, the director of the Europe, Russia, Eurasia Center and the Stuart Center here at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. And with me to discuss this incredibly important and interesting topic are two of the foremost experts. First, we have Dr. Jon Alterman, who I have the pleasure of being right next to and being an office mate right down the hall for me. And Dr. Hanna Notte is a senior associate nonresident fellow with the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program.
And Dr. Jon Alterman is the senior vice president for the Zbigniew Brzezinski Chair in Global Security and Geostrategy and director of the Middle East Program here at CSIS. I should also say that Hanna is in town. She's normally at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey, California but is based in Berlin. So, Hanna, let's jump into the conversation. Why don't, if you could maybe outline Russia's strategy toward the Middle East and maybe Iran specifically.
It seemed that over the previous decade, Russia had played a productive role when it came to the JCPOA negotiations that were trying to constrain Iran's nuclear program. Russia had a solid relationship, if not warm relationships with Israel. It wants to have positive relationships with the Gulf states. But since the war in Ukraine happened, there've been shifts. Maybe you could outline those.
Hanna Notte: Sure, happy to and it's great to be here again, Max. So first of all, I would say that Russian interests at large in the Middle East have not changed so much with the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022, I would argue. Russia has consistently pursued certain interests in the region, security interests. Russia is present in Syria since intervening in September 2015 in that country and is still present there and uses that presence as a platform to project power into the eastern Mediterranean, but more broadly into the Middle East. That remains an important interest of the Russian Federation to stay in the region.
Russia has a number of economic interests in the region, thinking of arms sales, where we've seen somewhat of a decline, arguably, but also building nuclear power plants in Egypt and in Turkey. Coordinating with the Gulf states in the OPEC+ format on the international oil markets. Grain, those interests stay constant and if anything, I'd argue given this harsh decoupling of Russia from the West in light of the invasion of Ukraine, those economic interests have only become more important. Now, having said that, some things have changed over the last two plus years. And that gets us to the topic of Russia-Iran relations as well.
The first thing I'd say is that Russia now really formulates its approach to the region through the prism of confrontation with the West over Ukraine. I would actually argue it's a confrontation over global order. So, it's not just about the territorial configuration of Ukraine, but that now dictates Russia's approach to the Middle East. Now, what does that mean? If you look at the period before 2022 there were still dossiers where Moscow would be willing to coordinate or cooperate with Western states. Syria, the Iran nuclear dossier that has largely fallen by the wayside. Turning to Syria, Russia is no longer cooperating when it comes to humanitarian access to the northwest of Syria. It is no longer supporting that through the Security Council, that has fallen away.
Russia has become, I'd say, more brazen since 2022 in pushing back against the U.S. presence in northeast Syria, so a more confrontational stance over Syria. Certainly, Iran and the JCPOA is another example where, before 2022, when the Biden administration tried to find a pathway back into a restored nuclear deal, Russia was quite helpful, I'd say, still quite constructive in working with Western counterparts on that. And now that has fallen by the wayside, and we can have a deeper discussion as to why that is. I think it's both a function of Russia no longer be willing to do that as sort of a de-prioritization of the issue, but also perhaps having lost some leverage over the Iranians. I think that also plays into it.
But more so, the one broad dynamic is just more confrontation. The logic of confrontation with the West is really dictating Russia's approach to the region. And the best example of that is how Russia has navigated the post-October 7th Middle East and the war in Gaza and we'll talk about that later. Now, a second dynamic and that is very much related, is that I would say we see a growing Russian tilt towards anti-Western forces in the region. Meaning Iran, but also Iran's partners and proxies in the Axis of Resistance. And we can talk about how that has manifested. Now, I think Russia still cares about pursuing certain balancing acts in the region that have been characteristic of its approach to the region for a long time.
And Russia still cares about, for example, its relations with the Gulf Arab states, in particular with Saudi Arabia and the UAE, because that is important to Russia economically. But I think Russia has been willing to somewhat sacrifice its relations with Israel since October 7th. We've seen this quite stark pro-Palestinian posturing over the war in Gaza. So, I think there is this pro-Iran, pro-Axis of Resistance tilt. And one way in which that manifests very much, and we can talk about this more, is in a growing Russian-Iranian military defense relationship, which goes far beyond the drones that Russia has procured from Iran for its military campaign against Ukraine.
And I think we should be looking at how that relationship is going to evolve into the future.
Mr. Bergmann: Maybe, if I could just follow up on that last point. Because it strikes me that in Russia's role in the Middle East prior to the war there was a large military component of Russia being an arms provider of S-400s to Iran. Support for Assad in Syria, but also potential arms sales, or arms sales to the Gulf States. But now Russia needs to absorb arms, it's not exporting as much. It needs countries to provide it with aid. It's getting that from North Korea in particular, but also Chinese support. But Iran has been really helpful here and maybe you could outline what is the nature of this military relationship now. And also, what is Russia providing back to Iranians?
Dr. Notte: Sure, happy to. I would say that the Russia-Iran military relationship was one, I mean, it's long-standing, it goes back decades. But until 2022 there was what one could call a patron-client dynamic in that relationship where, really Iran was on the receiving end hoping for certain systems from the Russians, which were not always forthcoming. If I think back to 2010 when the Russians, under President Medvedev did not provide the S-300 system to Iran. But we didn't really see Iranian support to Russia in any sort of a meaningful scale. What have we seen since? Since 2022 of course, the UAVs, the Shahed drones, I mean different types of Shahed drones.
But not just complete systems, importantly also Iran sharing production technology for those kinds of systems, enabling the Russians to effectively indigenize the production of those drones in Russia, in Yelabuga and in Tatarstan. The Iranians providing training on how to operate those UAVs and that training has happened in various countries based on what we know from reporting. Actually, including in Syria, where according to Ukrainian military intelligence, Hezbollah have trained Russian officers on the use of Iranian drones on Syrian soil. So, quite a sort of convoluted situation there.
But the Iranians have also given support to Russia for their ground war with ammunition, with shells. I think that's sometimes less talked about because we pay so much attention to the drones. So, that's what Russia has gotten from Iran. We can also have a separate conversation about learning on techniques how to overcome the effect of sanctions and sanctions evasion. There might be a lot of knowledge diffusion going on between those two partners in that area that's obviously harder to study from the open source. But certainly, they have come to agreements in that domain that they're going to work together on countering or mitigating the effects of Western sanctions.
If we now look at what the Russians have given the Iranians in return, you know, there's certain things that the Iranians have wanted for quite a long time that they haven't gotten yet. For example, the Sukhoi 35 fighter aircraft, even though there's been sort of intermittent talk about deals and delivery forthcoming, but we haven't seen those systems delivered. We've seen trainer aircraft, we've seen increased collaboration on electronic warfare, which is having the Israelis very worried in terms of what the Russians give the Iranians in terms of support in that area. We have seen Bill Burns, head of the CIA, state on multiple occasions this concern of Russian engineers supporting Iran's missile and space launched vehicle program.
So there's different areas in which the two sides are probably working together. And then one final point, I think that's important to mention here is that we've also seen indications of Russia passing captured Western origin technology captured on the battlefield in Ukraine to Iran. Which is probably studying those systems, and possibly using them for the purpose of reverse engineering or sort of looking into those systems. And of course, the Iranians are probably getting a lot of operational insights and sort of learning from how their own systems fair against Western air defenses or other technologies on the battlefield in Ukraine.
So, I think we need to not just look at hard systems and hard technology that is passing past both, in both directions but also the area of knowledge diffusion and intangible assistance.
Mr. Bergmann: That's a great point, because we often talk about the lessons learned that Western militaries are gaining from the Ukrainians engaging with the Russians. But it's definitely a two-way street and the provision of a lot of advanced technology to the Ukrainians will fall out of Ukrainian hands just due to the nature of warfare. And that's getting not just to Russia, but also to Tehran and potentially Beijing. Jon, I want to bring you into this to maybe offer the perspective from Tehran, from Iran. We'll put your Iranian hat on. But how does Iran view Russia, its potential, its relationship there.
And maybe you could also speak to how Russia is viewed more broadly within the Middle East and how that role evolved since the war in Ukraine.
Jon Alterman: Thank you. First, Max, it's a delight to be six feet away from you once again the way it's been most days. Hanna I thought did a wonderful job, but maybe made this very complicated relationship seem less messy than it really is. I mean, let's remember there were five Russo-Persian Wars, the Soviet Union occupied northern Iran. This is a relationship that has been troubled through the years, it's a relationship that was troubled where they were sort of aligned, not really aligned in Syria, and had very different goals, very different relationships with Turkey and so on. This is really, really, really complicated. There's a way in which the Ukraine war was clarifying for both the Iranians and the Russians. It gave them a strategic opportunity to work together.
It was, I think, very important for Iran, which really felt completely reliant on China, which gets 90% of Iranian oil. It represents more than 30% of Iranian trade, although Iran represents us in 1% of Chinese trade. And so, there's this strategic Iranian need not only to find ways to dismantle this international order the United States is trying to build. Common ground, undermining U.S.-led sanctions. Common ground, supplying weapons to Iran, bringing hard currency to Russia, bringing hard currency into Iran. This is a relationship which I would argue was deeply, deeply, deeply troubled and complicated, and there's a way in which the Ukraine war has clarified it and provided some really clear opportunities.
And what the Chinese like to refer to as win-win solutions that really advanced Iranian interests, advanced Russian interest, because the world they're trying to move toward is a very similar kind of world. I think the Chinese are largely aligned with this as well and I think that's part of why you see an effort, or you have seen an effort to portray the Gaza war as sort of the West against the Global South. There really has been this effort aligning Russia and China and Iran and Hamas, not in any positive vision but in a vision to undermine US hegemony. Now, from a regional perspective, there's not a lot of love for the Russians, there's not a lot of great sense that the Russians provide things.
The Russians, in their regional behavior, tend to be bottom feeders. They tend to go into places like Libya and Syria that are falling apart. They make marginal investments, derive marginal benefits. I don't think anybody, except maybe the Egyptians and maybe the Algerians are really enthusiastic about a Russian relationship. But there is this sense that the Russians provide a way to escape American hegemony. There's a sense the Americans come in and they want to change the world, they want to make everybody democratic, they want to impose their will. And what a lot of countries in the region would like is A) they'd like more control of what happens inside their own country without pesky people telling them how to run their lives.
And they want to be able to bargain for better deals. And there's a sense that by being non-aligned, by not taking a stake in these Great Power conflicts, we'll have a relationship with Russia and with China and the United States. We'll have good relations with Russia and China and the United States and we'll benefit from that and they can work out their own problems elsewhere. And the UAE is an example of a country with an increasingly strong relationship with the United States over the last three years, at the same time that they got a lot of Russians and a lot of Russian wealth that came out of Russia, went to the UAE, protected from sanctions.
And there's a sense on the UAE side that we don't have a dog in this fight. I was in Egypt right after the invasion, about a month later, and one of my Egyptian friends looked at me and gave me an expression that I'd never heard in Arabic, which is apparently a medieval phrase that means, I don't have a dog in this fight, except it involves camels. And which is true, of course, Egypt was profoundly hurt by the war in Ukraine, but there was this sense and I think there's a broader sense in the Middle East that “this isn't our fight, that's their fight. That's them fighting about their things. If you want to talk about sovereignty, let's talk about the Palestinians,” which in the eyes of many Arabs, the United States has never really cared about. And so, let them work their things out and we'll live our lives. And the Russians help them gain independence from this sense of an overweening United States.
Mr. Bergmann: So, it sort of seems that the relationship between Moscow and Beijing has become a partnership with no limits. This is, in some ways, a partnership with limits, or maybe it's not even right to call the Moscow-Tehran relationship a partnership, but it's a more transactional way of engaging. How would you think of that partnership?
Dr. Alterman: Well, look I think it's friends with benefits.
Mr. Bergmann: Yeah, friends with benefits. 
Dr. Alterman: There is a deep and messy history, which is really deep and really messy, it goes back a long time. But right now, from a strategic perspective, there is this alignment because for both Russia and Iran, the principal security threat they feel comes from the United States and its partners and allies. And there's both an urgency and a necessity to undermine that. An urgency and necessity to undermine sanctions, an urgency and necessity to rally forces around the idea that the United States can't boss everybody in the world around. And I think they say there's the history, but there's the present and we're going to deal with the present. 
Mr. Bergmann: The transactional nature of Russia's relationship, especially with Gulf states, strikes me as potentially problematic. That if Russia begins to provide Iran with more advanced weapons technology, will that receive pushback from the Gulf states? Or is Russia just sort of seen as a very transactional actor throughout much of the region?
Dr. Notte: I mean, just perhaps a quick note on transactional, I'm not entirely sure that I would characterize the Russia-Iran relationship as transactional today. Because to me, transactional implies a quid pro quo engagement, one party gives something and gets something specific in return. And I think there is a perception in Tehran, from what I understand, that one has already gotten a lot of things from this relationship over the last two plus years that one would have not gotten before they go beyond some military hardware. I mean, the Iranians have now acceded to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.
They are more aligned with Russia in various multilateral institutions. And they are also, for instance, making forays into Central Asia, enhancing their bilateral cooperation there where there's a sort of understanding that probably wouldn't happen if the Russians were opposed to it. So, sort of a broader perception that one gets sort of more and more from this relationship. Now, having said that, I completely agree, first of all, on the importance of historical mistrust that hangs over that relationship. Though I do wonder, building on years of working together in Syria and now since 2022 whether the importance of that historical mistrust, at least when we look at the Russian leadership and the IRGC, is becoming less important as an inhibitor of cooperation.
But certainly, there are constraints, and you just asked about the Gulf states. I think one explanation as to why Russia has not given certain systems to the Iranians might be in order not to antagonize, in particular, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. I mean, I was in Saudi Arabia a few weeks ago. I took up that issue of Russia-Iran cooperation and the sense that I got was, yeah, this is a problem for us and we do take it up with the Russians at the highest level. And you know, given that coordination in OPEC+ is very important for the Russians. And I mean President Putin, where did he go in the region after October 7th? He went to the Gulf, he didn't go to Iran, he went to Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
I do think that they care about this relationship, and so that might act as a break in terms of how far the Russians are willing to go.
Dr. Alterman: Absolutely true. And part of the reason why the Gulf states want to maintain a good relationship with the Russians is partly to drive resources, but partly to constrain what Russia does with the Iranians. Because the Gulf states are pretty transactional, and they believe in transactional relationships. And the Gulf states' relationship with China is enhanced by the belief that one of the ways to get greater Gulf security is by ensuring that Saudi Arabia exports more oil to China than Iran does. Because then, when the Saudis tell the Chinese, “we really need you to stop doing this,” the Chinese are more likely to listen than if there's a lesser sense of stake.
So, just as the Gulf states, in many cases, want to buy elaborate weapon systems from the United States to get the United States committed to their security, I think the Gulf States want to develop relationships with countries that are aligned with Iran to have all these countries go through a balancing act when they're thinking about the relationship with the Iranians, so they have a voice. And this, I think, is a very Gulf response and for Americans who are used to the bifurcated map of the world—remember the maps of Europe, there's the red side, there's the blue side—that's not the way they see the world.
They see Iran as a permanent reality, they see a relationship with Russia as an important way to constrain what Iran has. And I think on the one hand, they say we're not going to be able to cut off Iran, but we can certainly influence what people give to Iran, and that's why Gulf leaders are working closely with the Russians, not because they're going to walk off in a fit of pique, but because they say we're going to co-opt the Russians to some degree to constrain the Iranians when it comes to our interests.
Mr. Bergmann Hanna, you mentioned the kind of lessons learned on both sides reacting to Western sanctions. And I was wondering if we could maybe unpack this a bit. Right now, there's a huge effort to sanction the Russian economy but also to deprive Russia, especially the Russian defense industry, of crucial parts and components and technology. There are new sanctions that were just announced today by the United States that really goes after the banking sector to try to hopefully enforce sanctions, or to put the onus on banks to essentially help enforce a lot of the sanctions and export controls. What lessons learned, and this is question for both of you, is Russia taking from the Iranian experience and perhaps vice versa?
Dr. Notte: That's an excellent question and I think it's maybe hard to answer it with a great degree of specificity, because it's an issue that's very hard to study or get by through the open source. I mean, what do we know? We know that various Russian officials, including at the highest level have repeatedly stated that they see Iran as this model of perseverance, having persisted under sanctions for a long time. And that it's a model that one can look towards, actually, President Putin said it last week at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. He sort of applauded how the Iranians in certain industries and high tech have performed under Western sanctions, and that the Russians are sort of studying this closely.
And we've seen those Russian statements repeatedly over the last two years. And then this agreement that I noted that was concluded, I believe, in December of last year, to work together in that area. We've also seen certain Russian companies, I think there was a report in the Russian press that Pobeda, the Russian airline, should look towards Mahan Air, for example, in terms of studying how they've existed under sanctions. But let me make a suggestion in terms of how we can think about this issue more broadly. I think when it comes to potential Russian learning from Iran in the area of sanctions, I think there is learning in terms of how to evade sanctions.
And that gets us into the area of illicit procurement strategies, how to get stuff from abroad using front companies, hiding end users, those kinds of strategies which I think the Iranians have honed over decades, so sort of evading sanctions. And then there's the whole issue of overcoming the effects of sanctions, which is slightly different, which has more to do with strategic adaptation in your military industrial complex. How to simply make do without certain components or technologies coming from abroad, how to reverse engineer systems, how to domesticate the production of certain systems.
And I would say that in both areas, Iran has honed its skills and expertise over decades. And so, those are two slightly different types of learning. I would also say, though, that there are those who would argue that actually when it comes to strategies for evading sanctions, there's not so much that the Russians will be able to learn from the Iranians, because they themselves have honed those skills over decades, thinking back to Soviet times. So, it's perhaps also early days to see how all of this shakes out.
But there seems to me to be a bit of a debate in the expert community in terms of the extent to which the Russians will really learn from the Iranians or will need those kinds of skills.
Mr. Bergmann: Jon, I’m curious for your take on the sanctions back and forth. And you know Iran has had domestic turmoil, protests that erupted recently or last year. And is that sort of a warning sign to Russia about the impact of sanctions, or does it have nothing to do with sanctions?
Dr. Alterman: No, I think, you know, frankly you have two rotten regimes that are shot through with corruption. I think you have a lot of public despair at the nature of daily life. You have governments that try to use an external enemy to rally people. But a lot of people look around and say, ""What is this and what's the future of this?"" You also have these corrupt networks and I think in many ways, the corrupt network is even more robust in Iran than in Russia. But there's a plenty strong corrupt network in Russia, and that's part of the sanctions busting.
So, I think there is a way in which on large scale movement of financial flows, on engaging with the Chinese, on finding ways to hide oil shipments and things like that. I think there's a lot of learning that is going on, a lot of cooperation. There is this profound strategic alignment in undermining the U.S. ability to shape the world through the U.S. connection to global financial markets. And this is both strategic and urgent for Russia and Iran, strategic but not urgent for China. But you do have this growing movement to say the United States shouldn't be able to shape the world, and for Russia and China this is urgent as well as strategic.
Mr. Bergmann: I want to turn to October 7th in a second. But first, I want to ask you, Jon about the recent death of the Iranian president in a helicopter crash. Ibrahim Raisi died last month. What impact might that have on the bilateral relationship with Russia, if at all? Or will that upend Iranian politics? Is that something that, as Russia watchers, we should be paying attention to?
Dr. Alterman: No, because the president and the foreign minister aren't the ones driving the foreign policy. They're the ones executing it, but it's conceived and controlled by the Supreme Leader's office, and the principal instrument is the Revolutionary Guard Corps, and not either the conventional Iranian Army, the Artesh or the foreign ministry, or anybody else. What this means for the future of the Supreme Leader, the current Supreme Leader is 85. Although I have to say he looked very sprightly at the funeral for Raisi. He seemed to be doing pretty well, but he's 85. Raisi was perceived by some people to be a potential successor.
I think that's the space to watch, is the succession in the actual leadership and not the political leadership. They'll have an election in a few weeks there are, I think, several virtually identical candidates, one reformist, who I'm told is not likely to do well at all. The alienation of the public will mean turnout would be profoundly low. I think Iranians have decided this doesn't matter and I think Russians should also decide this just doesn't matter.
Mr. Bergmann: Let's turn to October 7th. Hamas' attack on Israel and Israel's response, going into Gaza has obviously been a global focus here in the United States, in Europe, and all around the world, especially in the Middle East. It also strikes me as sort of a pivot point for Russia in some ways in the region, particularly with its relationship with Israel, which had been, maybe characterizing it as warm is incorrect, but they had a working relationship between Moscow and Israel.
So, Hanna, maybe, if you could outline how has Russia approached the war in Gaza. And have they made inroads, at least from a kind of public diplomacy perspective. Have they made any gains in the region because of October 7th? And, maybe you could just describe their approach to this.
Dr. Notte: Yeah, happy to. I think at a broad level, I would say that Russia has used October 7th and events subsequently in order to denigrate the United States and the West more broadly. Both in terms of blaming this new outbreak of violence on past U.S. foreign policy, on the U.S. monopolization of the of the peace process and how we got here. But also in terms of how the United States and Western countries have navigated the scene since October 7th. And to tap into these powerful, not just regional, but global grievances over the Palestinian issue.
We know how that issue has played. There's perceptions of Western double standards in terms of how Western governments have dealt with the war in Gaza compared to the war in Ukraine. We have some left-leaning Latin American government severing their ties with Israel, we have the South African case against Israel. And I think Russia looks at all of this and understands it very well, and sort of taps into that and benefits from that, actually, without having to do very much. Now, does that score Russia points in the region? That's a whole different question. And my sense, and I'm very curious in Jon's points on this because he also speaks a lot with folks from the region.
There might be a bit of a bifurcation, perhaps, between just sort of average people and elites. I mean, certainly my perception has been that when you speak with Arab elites about how Russia has navigated this, there is no illusion about Russia being cynical and instrumental and exploiting this. And, you know, we haven't forgotten Russian bombing of hospitals in Aleppo and what Russia has done in Syria. And so there is, on one level, I think, that perception that it's a cynical approach to what is happening. But then, on the other hand, you do have this perception that, well, at the end of the day, the Russians are our guy on the UN Security Council.
They are the ones who are standing up for the cause of the Palestinians, and not just since October 7th, but also prior to that. And so, that does seem to score Russia some points, but I find it so hard to pinpoint to what extent that really translates into any meaningful Russian gains. Something that we've seen is Russia using the UN Security Council and the UN in particular, in order to use that as a platform to make its points on that conflict, facing off with us over various draft Security Council resolutions. What we're not seeing is Russia actually active as a diplomatic force to try to defuse this crisis.
So I don't think that if you go to the region, you will actually see anyone seriously looking towards Moscow or towards Beijing, for that matter, to actually get us out of this crisis. So, it seems to me that the United States is in the non-enviable position of simultaneously being the most hated power in the region right now, but also the one that everyone actually looks towards when it comes to being a diplomatic heavyweight and having leverage over the different parties. I mean, the Russians hosted intra-Palestinian meetings in Moscow, but from what I understand, that was also not a really serious undertaking. That was something that built on their previous engagement with the Palestinians, but not a serious effort.
Dr. Alterman: I think Hanna has it exactly right. There's a way in which I think a lot of people see Russia as a cynical actor in the region, but they see the United States as a sanctimonious actor in the region. And given a choice between cynical and sanctimonious, a lot of people in the Middle East say, ""Well, it's a cynical world out there, and why are the Americans consistently so sanctimonious."" I hear that in foreign ministries in the region, people watch RT and not CNN. There really is this sort of sense that the Russians can tap into the sense of unease which the region certainly feels since October 7th. There is a profound sense of U.S. double standards, a profound sense that the United States is standing by while tens of thousands of civilians are slaughtered.
And the United States could stop it and isn't stopping it. And therefore, I think the Russian cynicism feels right for the moment to a lot of people in the Arab world. As Hanna exactly correctly said, when you're looking for somebody to actually move a solution to the problem, the Americans are moving a solution. Tony Blinken is on his eighth visit to the Middle East, and every time he goes, that's where the diplomacy goes, that's where the solution set is. Still far away? I think we have a long way to go, but there is a sense that Russian and Chinese diplomacy, for all that people talk about Russian and Chinese influence in the Middle East, when there's work to be done, people turn to the United States.
But realistically, people also look and say, ""When's the last time the United States actually fixed the problem in the Middle East?"" Iraq has been a disaster and there's sort of this cascading sense that there's not really an alternative to the United States when it comes to threats from Iran, all those things. There's a sense the United States has to do it, but there's also this constant reinforcing of the inadequacy of the United States. That wasn't the feeling after 1991 when the US pushed Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait with a coalition of more than three dozen countries.
But I think that the Middle East looks generally at the United States and says, ""Your batting average is really low, and we need it to be higher. We need you to be more effective than you've been."" I'm happy to talk about the US-Russia relationship, or maybe Hanna wants to comment on this.
Dr. Notte: I mean, just two things to add to those excellent points. Because you asked at the outset whether this was a turning point for how Russia navigates the region. And I would say not quite, because Russian affinity with the Palestinian cause, and those contacts and hosting Hamas in Moscow, that all goes way back. And, you know, it goes back to Soviet times, but I would say that the Russians have, in previous instances of violence breaking out, been much more evenhanded in terms of how they would comment on the role of Israel and the Palestinians.
So, there is this sort of willingness to be quite harsh in terms of commenting on Israel. And I think one interesting question to watch going forward is, what does that mean medium- to long-term for the Russia-Israel relationship? It's my sense that both sides probably don't want that relationship to go south completely. They do still need to de-conflict in Syria, and I think that's something that the Russians want to continue to do. They do maintain contact, at least at the level of deputy foreign minister, ambassador in Moscow. I believe the Israeli ambassador attended Putin's inauguration a few weeks ago.
So, those contacts continue and perhaps neither side is prepared to let it go completely. Though I also hear from my Israeli contacts that the disappointment with how Russia has played this crisis runs really, really deep, and there's a great sense of frustration. The other point I wanted to make—
Mr. Bergmann: Hey guys, just quickly, just on that one thought, is that, you know, prior to October 7th, there was a lot of annoyance with the lack of Israeli assistance to Ukraine. Now, after October 7th, given Israel's at war, that's not really expected. But I do think that, you know, we're expecting a long war in Ukraine and hopefully the war in Gaza would come to an end relatively soon. I think that is one thing that will be sort of interesting. Where are we in 2025 and 2026 when it comes to the Israel-Ukraine relationship? At least on the military assistance side, where perhaps the Israelis might be willing to do a bit more when they weren't prior to October 7th.
Dr. Notte: Well, that's a great point. And the only other thing I wanted to add to what Jon said in terms of, you know, the Americans now have their work cut out for themselves, and that's who everyone's looking to in the region. And Russia has no interest in seeing US diplomacy succeed, I think, in diffusing those tensions. But Russia also can only go so far, I think, in throwing wrenches. And I think earlier this week was an interesting example where we saw that play out, where the UN Security Council passed a resolution to endorse this three-phase ceasefire plan. And everyone voted for it, and the Russians abstained rather than vetoing it.
And if you look at the Russian talking points explaining that decision, they are aware that there was Arab consensus behind that resolution. And so, they don't want to antagonize the Arabs on that issue, either. And so, they have to be, I think, careful how far they play that game of potentially torpedoing U.S. efforts.
Dr. Alterman: And I think Hanna is exactly right, that the Russians have too much stake in maintaining some sort of Israel relationship in the longer term. There is about 10 percent of the Israeli population of direct Russian descent, a lot of Ukrainians as well. There are economic ties which the Israelis have boosted through the years. There is this interest in deconfliction in Syria, they sort of have a similar view of the region, partly their skepticism of U.S. efforts to spread democracy. I think both Russia and Israel think strongman regimes provide security, it is a way to keep Islamists at bay.
Like the Gulf Arabs, the Russians are interested in maintaining a sort of balance. That balance has shifted away from Israel recently, but not irrevocably so. And it seems to me that we will get to a point in the not-too-distant future when the Russians and the Israelis will try to build back. I think as the Russians think about their global role, the Russians would like to be present at any sort of reconstruction project for Gaza as an issue of prestige, as indeed the Chinese will. Their instinct to undermine, to foil, to complicate will be there. And I think they will see people's desire to move forward, both the United States, Israelis and the Arab states, that'll be a way for Russia to get things, to get prestige, to get concessions.
And it all seems to me that this fits into the fact that Russia is a bottom feeder in the region. It is not wealthy, its reputation as a fighting force completely fell apart with Ukraine. It had been elevated a little bit by its performance in Syria, but Russia ultimately wants to be treated as a superpower in the Middle East. But it's a country with a GDP the size of Spain, smaller than Italy, right? And this is not a major force, they want to be treated like a major force. And I think countries in the region see an attraction in dealing with the Russians as a way to shape some of their relations with the United States.
But I don't think anybody in the region is under the illusion that we're back in the Cold War and you have a reasonable choice and you can do well with one or the other. Everybody is instead thinking, “What's the balance I have to strike between these two adversaries?” Except, I think that the Syrians and the Iranians are all in on Team Russia. But I think for most countries in the region, it's really a question of, “How do I strike that balance? What level of Russia, China, the United States do I want to have?” I think the bets, the core position is going to be a U.S. position. But there are hedges with Russia and China as a way to enhance leverage with the United States, where everybody feels much, much weaker.
Mr. Bergmann: Maybe I could just follow up on that a little bit, because it strikes me that the Russians are our prime diplomatic opportunists and like to see themselves as a global power and playing a big role in the world. They have a very large foreign ministry, Sergey Lavrov can be very active on the global stage, you know, during the Obama Administration, negotiating over Yemen, negotiating over Syria. And in some ways, it does strike me that the Russians could come in and say, ""Look, we're sort of a balanced broker here, we have a relationship with the Hamas, we have a relationship with Israel.""
Have they not tried, or is that just a completely ridiculous concept that they would even try to enter into a peacemaking role? Or is it just, they're very happy that the bag is sort of being left with the United States to try to resolve what seems like a very intractable conflict.
Dr. Alterman: I mean, my view is they were delighted to be part of the quartet when that was the thing in the early 2000s. Their problem is, when I was in Beijing in the early 2000s, all the Chinese were saying, ""We'd like to be part of the quartet."" And partly I wondered what the quartet was actually going to get done. And partly, I wondered, so you want a quintet? I'm not really sure how this works, but it'll be interesting when the dust starts to settle. Not only what role the Russians play, but what role the Chinese play, and where there's competition between the two over their future roles in the Middle East. It could work out the way the JCPOA worked out.
And what happened at that point was the Russians were active in a constructive way, and the Chinese kind of followed through. And the Russians would say something, the Chinese would nod. But part of me wonders if the way this is going to play out, is the Chinese aren't going to be content to just hold the Russian coattails. And instead, are going to envision themselves with a more central role and how Russia would respond to that. Again, it depends on things that haven't happened yet, and I don't know when it's going to happen. But I could imagine that this one ends a little bit differently than the last one did.
Dr. Notte: A few thoughts on this. So first of all, I would say that already, for years prior to October 7th, I think the Russians understood that when it comes to convening power on the Israel-Palestine file, their leverage was always going to be much more limited than that of the Americans. Which is why they lamented the Abraham Accords or the diplomacy leading up to that and the U.S. diplomacy on that file. And try to really carve out a niche for themselves in order to stay relevant with intra-Palestinian meetings in Moscow that were convened, not just since October 7th, but also prior to that.
On the other hand, I would say, when it comes to Russia and China and the potential competition here, I'm not quite sure. It's possible but so far, it seems to me that looking at Russian reactions to Beijing playing a role in Iran-Saudi rapprochement, or even now Beijing hosting an intra-Palestinian meeting subsequent to the one that happened in Moscow. I haven't seen a whole lot of criticism coming out of Russia. The sense that I get is that right now, as long as it's not the Americans, as long as it's China, that's in the broad scheme of things good for us. Whether that turns into greater competition down the line, I think is an open question.
Dr. Alterman: Right. But it's going to be the Americans. I mean, there will be a central American role in the reconstruction of Gaza, and there will be a central Arab role. And the extent to which the Chinese seek to assert themselves, the extent to which the Russians are going to feel comfortable with the Chinese asserting themselves or overshadowing the Russian role, I think is a potential friction point to watch.
Dr. Notte: Yes, possibly. And I think what you see Russia calling for now is international conferences that involve all P5 and regional countries on that particular issue. Because they also know that, when it comes to Israel, they've sidelined themselves as a viable mediator for the foreseeable future.
Mr. Bergmann: I want to maybe bring this back to Iran a bit. I think there's sort of growing concern about Russia's use of proxies, both using hybrid tactics in Europe. There's been lots of incidents of sabotage and arson and potential attacks on critical infrastructure. Basically, Western concern about Russia's response to the West. And there's been concern about in the Sahel in North Africa, where there's been a number of military coups where Russia has been seen as supportive in playing a role, sort of boosting these regimes militarily.
And so, if you kind of view Russia-West through the lens of “We're kind of in this proxy struggle,” it strikes me that the Middle East is a potential place for that kind of U.S.-Russia-Western proxy struggle to take place. Now, maybe you could talk a little bit about Russia's relationship with a lot of Iran's proxies, whether it's Hezbollah, whether that's in Yemen. And does Russia potentially play a role in potentially either stoking conflict, or does it have an interest in trying to sort of facilitate a larger conflagration in the region? Or potentially Iran-Israeli conflict that we seem to be on the cusp of.
So, how do you kind of see Russia's role in the current strategic problems I described, or the security problems in the Middle East right now?
Dr. Notte: I mean, I would answer that question in two parts. Enhancing its ties with Iranian partners and proxies somewhat? Yes. Stoking a regional escalation or regional war? No. So, I think what we've seen over the last two years and then certainly since October 7th is perhaps a greater Russian willingness to embrace some of Iran's partners and proxies. I mean political contacts with Hezbollah, with the Houthis, with Hamas go back many years. I don't think that we've ever had something that you could call systemic security assistance by Russia to those actors. And I don't think that that's what we're seeing now, I haven't seen any evidence to indicate that.
Though you see more reports of the odd weapons system, perhaps being passed by Wagner or by Russia to Hezbollah, for example. Certainly, at the political level, I think Russia has been quite vocal in defending taking the side of Hamas and the Houthis on the UN Security Council. And it has hosted delegations from both Hamas and the Houthis in Moscow, which is also, I think, quite an interesting signal. So, the way I would put it is there's somewhat of a greater desire or willingness to egg on the Axis of Resistance and use its potential to sort of be a spoiler in regional affairs than perhaps was the case prior to the war in Ukraine.
Having said that, when you ask me about Russian calculus regarding an escalation in the region, whether that's a war between Israel and Hezbollah, which is having a lot of people concerned now. Or even some confrontation between Israel and Iran, it might be tempting to think that that would be in Russia's interest, because you could sort of say, well, if that happens, then U.S. military resources and bandwidth is going to be even further averted away from Ukraine and towards the Middle East. After October 7th, we saw the United States moving Patriot batteries to the region. Then in mid-April, when we had the recent exchange of strikes between Israel and Iran, the United States also came to the defense of Israel.
And so, if we have a broader war, there might be further resources going to the region that could be good for the Kremlin, as could an increase in oil prices that might result from such an escalation. I think the World Bank said in late April that if there's a serious escalation in the Middle East, then the oil price might go above $100 a barrel. Now, having said that, I'm not so convinced that it would be really beneficial for Russia, because if we see escalation, there are certain risks for Russia. And let me name three that I can see. If you have a war between Israel and Hezbollah, it's hard for me to see how such a war would not make Syria a secondary arena for that confrontation.
I mean, already since October 7th, we've seen Israel step up its strikes on Iranian partners on infrastructure that the Iranians use in Syria quite a bit. You know, Israel has really stepped up a notch. And if we were to see a proper war, certainly the effect on Syria wouldn't be anything like the effect would be on Lebanon but still, we could see a scale up in Israeli operations. And I'm not sure if you're Russia and you continue to care about your assets and your influence in Syria, that is something you want to see. So, that's a first thought that I would have.
The second is that, depending on how such an escalation shakes out, it could decimate Iran's defense infrastructure, at least to some extent. If there's a war between Israel and Hezbollah, the Iranians would be quite preoccupied supporting their partner with missiles and drones. And if Iran is attacked, then depending on what is being targeted, I think that could also be quite painful. Now, if you're Russia, do you really want to see that happen to your partner? You could make the argument that the Russians have already become somewhat less dependent on the Iranians because they've indigenized some of that UAV production. They're also getting shells from the North Koreans.
Okay, fair enough. But I still think that for as long as the war in Ukraine is ongoing, and you sit in Moscow, you don't want to see that happen, especially if you don't know how it's going to shake out. And the last point I make is that Russia has really benefited from Iranian-Gulf Arab rapprochement and Iranian-Saudi rapprochement. Because it makes it easier for the Russians to thread that needle between accruing geoeconomic benefits from dealing with the Gulf States while also dealing with Iran. Now, depending on how regional escalation shakes out, and I'm curious as to your thoughts on this, it could put Iran-Gulf Arab rapprochement at risk. And it could then make Russia's own balancing act between those different actors somewhat more tenuous or precarious.
So, I think my point here is that Russia would have very limited control over how things shake out, and it certainly doesn't want to get involved in any regional conflagration with its own military assets, because the priority is the campaign in Ukraine. So, Russia would also certainly stand to lose. Regional war might be bad for Russia's enemies, but it could also be quite painful for Russia.
Dr. Alterman: I think Hanna has it basically right. I think we make a mistake when we project American ambition onto the Russians. I don't think the Russians think that they can remake the region. You know, we invaded Iraq to remake Iraq, we invaded Afghanistan to remake the greater Middle East, we had a global war on terror. There was really this sense, we had the forward march of freedom and we had all this sense that we're going to reshape things, and by dint, both of military efforts and political efforts and assistance and all those things, that we can change the region.
I think Russia makes small bets, really small bets, with very limited tools, very limited risks. And they try to get small gains from small bets, and they will react to whatever opportunities they have without taking large risks. It seems to me that on the issue of proxies, the Russians aren't really as comfortable as the Iranians are with proxies. The Iranians love the sort of deniability, what some of my friends call implausible deniability, right? We don't really control them. I think the Russian use of proxies is Wagner, which they obviously control.
I don't think they like the idea of guys with beards running around doing what they want to do, attacking things. To my understanding, the Iranians love that. I don't think that's where the Russians want to go, and that is a barrier to the Russians being all in with the Iranian strategy, partly because of some of the risks that Hanna was talking about.
Mr. Bergmann: No, I think that's a great point. And the only thing I think I might add is that I do think that the Russians do have an inflated view of themselves. And as a revisionist power, I think might see real opportunity in an Israel-Iran conflict. And I think in unpredictable ways perhaps, but it's not as if they necessarily have the ability or power to actually stoke that on the sideline.
Dr. Alterman: And it's not like the 1973 War where they see themselves as sort of right there at the table. I think again, their engagement was with Libya, their engagement was with Syria, their engagement is in places that are completely falling apart. And then their investment in Syria: fewer than 5,000 troops and I think fewer than was it two dozen fixed wing aircraft?
Mr. Bergmann: Mm-hmm.
Dr. Alterman: Maybe one dozen.
Mr. Bergmann: Yeah.
Dr. Alterman: A tiny investment changed the course of the war, got a permanent naval base, I mean all those things. It's a remarkable economy of effort. You don't have the ambitions the United States has, you don't have the outcomes the United States is seeking. But you're making progress in a world that you're convinced is stacked against you. And the Americans have an optimistic world, an optimistic view that we can make this all work out. And to my mind, I'm not a Russia expert, to my mind, the premise of the Russian stuff is, “It's all miserable let's make it a little better.”
Mr. Bergmann: Yeah. Final question because we're at time. Do you see the Russian-Iranian relationship staying where it is, or on an upward trajectory to become closer and to get stronger? Hanna.
Dr. Notte: I see it on a slight upward trajectory, not going towards a full, I don't know, military alliance. But certainly moving past some of the transactionalism that we've seen in the past. Because again, to come back to Jon's point, I think they just fundamentally united in a common purpose, which is to undermine the United States, the West and what they see as an unjust and stacked against them global order. And that's a very powerful uniting factor that perhaps overcame some of that historical mistrust and the other breaks that we saw and that we still see in the relationship.
Dr. Alterman: Exacerbated by the persistence of the current government in Iran and the ongoing nature of the Ukraine war. If either one of those things change, I could see a shift in the relationship. But as Hanna says, as long as we have that logic, the strategic alignment, it seems to me that we'll have a gradual increase in integration.
Mr. Bergmann: Well, we're going to have to leave it there, unfortunately. Hanna, thank you so much for joining us, for being here in D.C. from your home in Berlin. Jon, thanks so much for joining us. And a massive thank you to all of you who tuned in to watch this event. And if you did, I suggest taking out your phones right now because you should subscribe to our podcast. We have Russian Roulette here and also Jon's podcast, Babel: Translating the Middle East. And you can get those wherever you get your podcasts. Thank you so much for joining us, and have a great afternoon.

39,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/jonathan-rynhold-israels-divided-politics,Unknown,"June 11, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"Jon Alterman: Professor Jonathan Rynhold is the head of the Department of Political Studies at Bar-Ilan University in Israel and a senior researcher at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies. Jonathan, welcome to Babel.
Jonathan Rynhold: Thank you. 
Jon Alterman: Where is Israeli public opinion now? How has it changed since October 7th, and how has it changed in the last 10 years? 
Jonathan Rynhold: At the beginning of this war, there was a very strong, unified sense of purpose. It was very clear to all Israelis, not only Israeli Jews, but also Israel's Arab citizens, what Israel needed to do. It needed to defeat Hamas and it needed to use a lot of military force to do that. That kind of bound the country together. The horizon of what you do afterwards was a long, long way off. Over the last few months, we have approached the critical elements where there is more disagreement. For example, whether getting the hostages back is more important or whether bringing Hamas down as the governmental authority in Gaza is more important. That begins to have a stronger impact in the debate. 
It's also become intertwined with the end of this unity government that the center and the left are looking to leave. The third element I would say is that Israelis are becoming somewhat more tired. Our younger members of society, who are between 18 and 25, are carrying the bulk of this. Many of them have been fighting in Gaza since October with only maybe a week off here and a day off there. That's it. That's very, very tiring for a lot of people. Under those kinds of circumstances, the criticisms of the higher echelons, be they the political or sometimes the military, but mainly the political, become sharper.
In terms of the last 10 years, I think that what we've seen is two things. One, we've seen a hardening of the opinion that there is no partner for peace on the Palestinian side. Even if Israel were to give more than the Israeli public believes is correct to the Palestinians in the form of a state, certain borders, and half of Jerusalem, Israelis wouldn’t believe they would get the minimal level of peace that they would want, which they would think of in terms of “when my daughter goes to eat pizza in Jerusalem, she won't be blown up”—the very, very minimal. This lack of faith has destroyed the peace camp. It has also destroyed the centrists because they said, “Well, look, we can't have peace, but let's disengage from Gaza. Let's disengage from Lebanon.”
When the disengagement from Lebanon and Gaza led to lots and lots of missiles landing on Israel, then most Israelis said, “Don't talk to me about the longer-term problems of a two-state solution, Jewish majorities, and all of that. Just stop the missiles. Make sure they don't land on my apartment.” While that's how most of the public sees it, that created an opening for the more ideological right in the Knesset. People have not suddenly become en masse ideologically right-wing, but the solutions that were offered by the center and left are seen to have failed and the right has managed to gain a foothold. People on the far right, particularly in the last four or five years, have an unprecedented level of influence on Israeli politics, which doesn't really reflect the breadth of attitudes in Israeli society. 
Jon Alterman: It feels like there are contradictory instincts. One is “we're tired of what we're doing.” A second is “there's really no alternative to what we're doing.” As you said, it's a lot of young people engaged in the war. A lot of your students and former students who are in the middle of all of this. What is the mood on campus among these young people? Is it different from what we hear about the Israeli public at large? 
Jonathan Rynhold: Israeli campuses tend to be much quieter places than American campuses politically and a large part of that is because Israelis study later. They've been in the army for two, two and a half, or three years. Perhaps even more interesting is that in the last decade or so the number of Arab students at my university has gone up from about 1 percent to about 14 percent. You hear a lot of Arabic; you see two women speaking Arabic between them. One with a head covering and one without. Yet, it's very quiet on our campus. There is no palpable tension. The university president says he keeps quiet about it because he knows that if he was to say something positive, someone would make sure that the atmosphere suddenly became a lot nastier. 
It's not that we don't know that in the background there are a lot of stresses. At the beginning of the war, Arab students didn't always turn up to class. I think they were concerned about the response. But now they do. It can be a difficult thing to navigate, particularly in the politics department. I have to say however, so far, it's been very impressive. I think the students who are fighting are mainly wrapped up in either fighting, or making sure that they get the allowances that they need in order to pass the exam. But it's all really very practical.
Jon Alterman: Getting back to the broader climate in Israel, it seems to me from where I sit that there's very little reporting in the Hebrew language press about the humanitarian conditions in Gaza, which is a real difference from both the international Israeli press, which is in English, and international newspapers, like the Washington Post, New York Times, and others. Is it accurate that the Hebrew language press really isn't covering issues of civilian conditions in Gaza? Is it changing? What other kinds of sources are Israelis plugging into, or does it just not matter? 
Jonathan Rynhold: There's no doubt that we see less of the suffering in Gaza than you would if you were in London, New York, or Los Angeles. But we do see it. We know it's there, and actually, in some ways, we see it more. That's because when you have 300,000 young Israelis in Gaza, and they come home for the weekend, that's what they talk about. From their perspective, they've got a split second to decide whether this is a woman or a child, or a young man or a youth. Someone who is 15 or 16 years old—has he got a weapon? For them, that's how they are processing it. There's a lot of stress. I can't tell you that every soldier cares about it, but I hear these stories regularly and those are the things that they will talk about, or they'll talk about the risks that they had to take. 
The child of a friend of mine, she's the medic for three tanks. That means she has to get out of the tank if there's someone injured in the other tank. But because she's small, she can fit in this little space at the back of a tank. And she saved four soldiers' lives because she could get in this space and give them first aid. Why do I tell that story? Because that’s where the Israeli public is. It feels like it can't allow itself to be too emotionally engaged in the suffering on the other side because it needs to win. Afterwards, I would imagine that in time that will begin to look different, at least for some Israelis. But for the public at large, I think they are extremely focused on either the hostages, winning, or both. 
There are Israelis who do care a lot about this. Quietly and behind the scenes, Israeli organizations have actually been facilitating aid going into Gaza. However, the ability to do that, given the type of government we have, requires keeping quiet about it. The government knows, but if it was to become public, that would create a political problem. So, what you read about is all the attempts of the far-right to block aid, and that is also a political problem because the prime minister feels his government will collapse without these extremists. 
Jon Alterman: I want to come back to hostages, but I just want to pick up on the thread you suggested that there are some soldiers who care a lot about the rules of war and differentiating victims. It's also clear there are some people in the Israeli military and Israeli society who say, “Look, they're all terrorists, or they support them, and we're going to win.” Does the fact that the military itself has a strong split on these issues manifest itself in any visible ways? Are there people who say that “this is making our job so much harder and it has to stop”? 
Jonathan Rynhold: The irony is that the civilians tend to be more gung-ho than the high-ranking officers, and that's for a number of reasons. First of all, the social background of a lot of the intelligence officers and the strategists is more ‘small-l’ liberal. The fighting soldiers and elite units may sometimes be more right-wing and more religious, but they are very disciplined; that military discipline can constrain things. It tends to be non-elite units of people who are sort of less committed. That's usually where the bad stuff happens. There are officers, obviously, who take a less humanitarian view, but I think that division is usually more subtle in the field. The question is “what degree of risk?” There's no doubt that in general, the rules of engagement of the IDF have been loosened in this conflict, and that's because the level of threat is far greater, and the losses are far greater. 
The IDF will always think about, “Do we use a one-ton bomb, or do we use a two-ton bomb?” They don't move without lawyers because, in practical terms, it's not only a moral issue, but it's also a political issue with the ICJ and ICC. There's an understanding within the hierarchy that fighting the war according to the rules as best you can is important to being able to do the job. On the other hand, sometimes they just want to get the job done. The way the Israeli army works is that our offices in the field have a huge amount of leeway in deciding things. That's why it can look very different in different places and at different times. Still, I think the emphasis remains on getting the job done. 
Jon Alterman: Have you seen a change in the way Israelis are talking about the war because of the ICC and ICJ actions? 
Jonathan Rynhold: Yeah, there's no doubt that has helped Netanyahu and the right. All the polling shows that the ICC and ICJ actions, and the recognition of a Palestinian state by Spain, Ireland, and Norway, have, from the Israeli perspective, fit into Hamas' strategy. Their strategy is: you put your fighters protected underground, and you put your civilians and your weapons above ground. Either Israel kills your civilians and has huge diplomatic and political problems, and perhaps will be stopped from destroying you, or Israeli soldiers get killed because they're careful with civilians. That's the Hamas strategy. The sense that it doesn't matter what we do and that we'll never have the level of understanding from the rest of the world for the type of dilemmas that we have feeds into the right-wing narrative in Israel that the world is against us. President Biden bought a hell of a lot of credit at the beginning of this war, but it is running down. Although he didn't really stop much of the weapons coming to Israel, and Israelis are not fully aware of just how much weaponry America has supplied and just how critical that's been. So, the public tends to be lessening their thankfulness to the president, and Netanyahu has been rising because of these things.
Jon Alterman: You talked about the military being concerned about the ICC and ICJ issues, but your feeling is that is part of the growing divergence between the military and the civilians. The political leadership has been using it to make hay. The military leadership has found it increasingly constraining. Is that how you see it?
Jonathan Rynhold: Yeah, the political leadership is using it to make hay, but it's not hard for them. Listen, if the president of the United States says it's outrageous, then Israelis are only going to feel it's extremely outrageous. So, that's the first thing. I don't think they have to work very hard to make political hay out of it. The second thing is, it is not so much that the military doesn’t feel that sense of outrage. It's that their main concern is, “We need to be able to do what we need to do in Gaza, and therefore we look at the ICC and ICJ from a practical point of view. How do we navigate this? How do we keep the Americans on board?” It's just a professional view. They share the same gut instincts, but they have to actually think, “What do we actually do about it?”
Jon Alterman: You talked about Hamas putting its fighters below ground and leaving civilians and weapons above ground. Of course, hostages are also below ground, and it seems that there's a rising debate in Israel about the priority that freeing hostages should take vis-a-vis militarily defeating Hamas. Has the hostage issue become a game changer in the way Israelis are thinking about this? Do you expect it to rise or fall in importance as Israelis think about the strategy for going forward? 
Jonathan Rynhold: There are two elements to this. There's the atmospherics, what happens on the streets, and demonstrations. In that sense, you very much see the hostages issue becoming more important. But when you start to look at the polling, it’s not clear that there's that big a change in the priorities. If you say to Israelis, “a complete ceasefire in exchange for the hostages,” the majority will be against it. If you say, “a six week pause and then we can start again, and we get the hostages,” then you'll get a majority in favor. Obviously, the president deliberately kept that very vague. So, you can have a debate in Israel. It's a bit of shadowboxing because we haven't seen an offer on the table that the majority of the Israeli public would support. That's why Netanyahu always says, “but we are not giving up on destroying Hamas.” In other words, “I'm prepared to make some concessions.” 
More terrorists can be released and the ceasefire can be for a bit longer, but it's hard to see just a complete ceasefire. The public might go along with it because they will think they can restart the war in six weeks when they’re actually entering a track that they can't deviate from. That's possible. But if you tell them up front, a majority will be against it. But it's also interrelated with the discontent with Netanyahu. The strongest feeling in Israel is that Netanyahu does what's good for Netanyahu politically, and that he is unable to distinguish between what's good for Israel and what's good for Netanyahu. It's what's good for Netanyahu that defines what's good for Israel. As a result, people say that he doesn't want to compromise on the hostages because he wants the war to go on as long as possible so he can stay in power. 
Now one can believe that and believe that he is that cynical, and still believe that he's not wrong about not ending the war until Israel has brought Hamas down. As General Petraeus said, you can't really put out 80 percent of a fire. You've got to put the whole thing out. I think there's confusion there because of two things coming together, and the lack of clarity about the president's latest plan only adds to that. When the president says, “I don’t trust Netanyahu,” a lot of Israelis will agree with that—and probably a majority—but that doesn't mean they're going to agree with everything that he said.
Jon Alterman: You've written very thoughtfully about the future shape of politics in Israel and what coalitions can look like. I've seen a number of accounts that suggest that even if the government fell, new elections were called, and a new government was formed, Netanyahu would be in power for the next five months because of the time between now and the elections, and then the time of government formation. How does that affect any sort of end game going forward?
Jonathan Rynhold: A Netanyahu in power with the war going on in a serious way is one scenario, and a Netanyahu in power where the war has more or less ended is a different scenario. If the war has more or less ended, there would be massive public demonstrations in Israel against Netanyahu, but there could also be a reaction to that with major demonstrations in favor of him. The dynamic in the war itself, I don't think will be critical because even if Israel continues this war on a lower flame and wants to get rid of Hamas, it's going to take a lot, even when the big fight ends. Let's say Israel takes Rafah, it's still going to be months and months of establishing order so that somebody else can take over.
The issue would be more about how that would be synchronized diplomatically. It would distance what the Saudis and the Biden administration want, which is to link a resolution to Gaza with the normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, and a defense treaty or guarantee between Israel and the Saudis. However, the only thing given, I think, the rightful cynicism Israelis have towards the prime minister, is that it's not impossible that he might end the war and blame Biden and the Americans for not allowing Israel to finish the job, and then take advantage of that to then do a deal with the Saudis. That is not impossible. He could do that. It wouldn't surprise me because I'm not sure that in his heart of hearts he thinks that getting rid of Hamas is such a good idea. 
He obviously has to be publicly committed, in every way, to destroying Hamas. But at the end of the day, this is someone who is cautious, who intrinsically believes that there is no political solution on the horizon, that a Palestinian state is dangerous, and that the Palestinian Authority (PA) is not an alternative. So, the more the Palestinians are divided, and the more chaotic and weak things are there, that's not necessarily bad. He just can't be the author of it. A lot will depend on his political standing. One of the advantages of an interim government is you can't bring it down. That means, paradoxically, he's under less pressure from the far-right, and therefore, moving to the center might make sense. That's where he has lost mainly. It might make sense. It's not impossible to imagine that scenario. 
Jon Alterman: You talked earlier about how Biden got a lot of credit for coming to Israel in October. There is a sense that the value of that is diminishing over time. Increasingly, it feels to a lot of people, like the Israeli leadership is just waiting out President Biden with a sense that he may not be there after November, so it won't really matter. Do you sense that the United States has a window to act under Biden, or do you think that the United States is going to be relevant anyway because the United States is relevant to everything Israel does? 
Jonathan Rynhold: I think the latter. American presidents occasionally think they can walk away from the Middle East and then it just comes back and hits them in the face. I'm sure that President Trump would like nothing more than to walk away from the Middle East. Being a sort of belligerent isolationist, he's very happy to smash Iran if it does something directly against an American citizen or America, but he doesn't respond if it's against the allies. From an Israeli perspective, it's by no means clear that waiting things out is a good idea. 
Jon Alterman: Although Israeli public opinion is much more favorable to Trump than Biden right now. 
Jonathan Rynhold: Sure. In terms of public opinion, you're right. But that's the Israeli public. They look at the symbolic, the grand gesture, and Trump's very truculent language towards the Palestinians or Israel's enemies. That's the thing that they remember. But the IDF and the security establishment will look at the amount of aid, a $14 billion dollar package that Biden has given, the amount of military equipment, the support at the UN, and Biden sticking his neck out many times. They will value that, and they'll worry that President Trump says he doesn't want to give Israel aid, he wants it to be loans. Will he be willing to send two aircraft carriers to deter Hezbollah and Iran? President Biden did it quicker than any American President has ever done. That commitment was much quicker and much more complete than 1967 or 1973. It's unprecedented, really.
Now the public doesn't know that. Right? They think America has always been very supportive. The defense establishment does know it. So, while it might hope that a Trump Administration might be more assertive towards Iran, it's more the public that sort of thinks Trump's a good thing. And I think that those people who think strategically are not sure exactly what's better and value President Biden more. Right-wing politicians are with the public.
Jon Alterman: I'm wondering, based on all of that, if you feel that Biden really has an opportunity to shape Israeli public discourse. Or is it more like a rugby scrum where you're just all sort of locked shoulder to shoulder and trying to push inches one way or the other?
Jonathan Rynhold: I think there is something he could do, but I don't think he will do it. That is to allow Israel to bring down the Hamas regime by destroying the remaining armed forces in Rafah, and coming to an agreement with Israel that it will establish order there over a few months. At that point, he can pivot to, ""Now I want the Palestinians to take over. I want a reinvigorated Palestinian authority."" And particularly at that juncture, when for Israelis it becomes a choice between our children are doing 60 days reserve duty every year in Gaza or the Palestinian Authority, and then we could get in return something with the Saudis.
At that juncture, if he can do that pivot, then that would make a difference. If he was to choose a governor of Gaza so it's under the PA, and you have Salam Fayyad as prime minister. Now Salam Fayyad is a Palestinian leader who has credibility with the Israeli public. Not because they love him, but because he can point to the fact, ""I made it better, I'm not corrupt, and security was better."" It's just the only guy who delivered. The Gulf Arabs like it for the same reasons. So that would be my grand strategy if I was advising President Biden. 
You could do this but there is this mistaken belief that Israel's involved in counterinsurgency when it's actually fighting a war. We're not doing Afghanistan, and we're not doing Iraq. We're destroying a conventional force, and we're bringing down a government. We understand that we can't destroy Hamas as an idea and that there will remain an insurgency. But we're trying to create a different base in Gaza. I think that if you consent to part one of what Israelis want, then you will have a lot of leverage over part two.
Jon Alterman: But it almost sounds like a one-two punch, that the first is to become more permissive of Israeli military goals and then become much less permissive of an unwillingness to move toward American-Arab political goals afterward.
Jonathan Rynhold: Absolutely. That's exactly what I'm saying. I'm saying the bottom line for Israelis is the security stuff. So, if you're very good on that, and your demands are in areas that don't directly affect security, it will be a lot more difficult for the right in Israel to make their case. And a tired Israeli public will potentially remember Joe Biden and what he has done in this war. It will offer them some hope because the Israeli public right now doesn't see any hope that things could get better. If you can allow them to say to themselves, ""Well, we've got rid of the main problem and here is a potential way forward, which is not that dangerous. We'll control the security situation on the outside. We control the border with Egypt. Let's see if Fayyad can do what he did in the West Bank in Gaza. Then we don't have to worry about all the extra extremism that's happened in the West Bank.""
And if I'm Palestinian, I can still say, ""It's the Palestinian authority."" I could still say that ""Abbas and Ramallah, they decide all the foreign policy. They do all the negotiations.” And, the Biden administration has always said, “We want you to recommit to a two-state solution, but we see it as over the horizon, not in the next five minutes.""
So that's something I think the Israeli public can hear, but only after Rafah is done because otherwise, the feeling is that this is ‘instead of.’ And the overwhelming feeling in Israel is, ""First we have to win this.""
Jon Alterman: How would an American government hold the Israelis to phase two after they complete phase one, especially if Biden may not be there to enforce adherence to phase two?
Jonathan Rynhold: If it's Biden, what he has done, that I thought was really smart, is that he made the distinction that I'm talking about by continually supplying Israel with the weapons that America thought were needed. Some that they thought were too much, they didn't supply, but that didn't stop Israel from being effective. On the other hand, he sanctioned the most extreme settlers. That was very smart because what it said is, ""I'm helping you on security, the thing that most of you care about. But we're a democracy, and the reason that we're supporting you is because you're a democracy. That's the reason we're supporting Taiwan, that's the reason we're supporting Ukraine. That's the reason we're on your side against Iran. So, you need to understand we're not going to indulge you on that stuff, but you also need to understand we're going to protect you whatever on the other stuff.""
It's like saying, “We want to make sure the Palestinians have a decent life."" This is not a problem in Israel. Nobody is going to say they shouldn't have a decent life. The problem is always the fear of them building up military power and then attacking Israel, eroding the Israeli public's morale, or creating a sense of a war every day and a threat around every corner. I think that strategy of saying, ""A two-state solution but only one that's safe for Israel. We're only asking you not to have more settlements, and we’re supporting you on the security.” I think that strategy is the sweet spot.
What you have in President Biden and indeed President Trump, should he want, is a president with about as much capital in the bank as you can have. And a prime minister, if it's Netanyahu, who is shaking on these things. And the fact that this current government is offering the ultra-orthodox exemptions from the army is making mainstream Israel extremely angry at this government.
If they don't have an enemy to punch, people start looking at what they're doing and then they don't look quite so good. The ability to play that, I think, is the best way for America to influence what goes on in Israel.
Jon Alterman: Jonathan Rynhold, thank you very much for joining us on Babel.
Jonathan Rynhold: My pleasure, thank you very much.

Runde and Ilya Timtchenko,"June 5, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"The world’s economic leaders—the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom—will gather in Italy from June 13–15, 2024, for the 50th G7 summit to discuss, among other pressing issues, Russia’s war against Ukraine and how to enable Ukraine to win the war while sustaining international support for full compensation from Russia to Ukraine for damages and for Ukraine’s reconstruction. The transfer of Russian sovereign assets to Ukraine is on the agenda. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky will participate. The G7 should seize the opportunity to act with urgency on two critical issues: (1) the creation of an international claims mechanism that will hold in trust for Ukraine Russian sovereign assets intended as reparations for Ukraine and (2) an international claims commission to adjudicate allocation of these funds as compensation for damages or reconstruction.
Ukraine will be the G7’s biggest test during the summit: will the G7 countries announce agreement on a consensus approach to utilizing frozen Russian sovereign assets to support Ukraine? If so, what will be the details of the G7’s strategy? This paper seeks to outline the critical questions that must be answered in formulating the G7’s strategy to ensure Ukraine’s survival and economic recovery.
Ukraine’s Funding Needs Are Enormous and Immediate
Just as delay in the U.S. emergency supplemental appropriations package has had grave consequences for Ukraine, any delay in transferring frozen Russian sovereign assets to Ukraine will hinder Ukraine’s prospects to be victorious in its ongoing battle against Russia’s illegal aggression and rebuild its economy for a peaceful, democratic future.
The financing of Ukraine requires large sums of money to cover both military and civilian needs—well beyond the recent emergency supplemental package passed by the U.S. Congress. Ukraine’s military alone likely requires $130 billion annually to ensure a victory on the battlefield. The World Bank estimates that as of December 31, 2023, the total cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine will be at least $486 billion over the next decade, and some experts estimate the cost may run as high as $1 trillion. To ensure that Ukrainians are justly compensated for their losses, the international community should establish an effective international claims mechanism, which requires a compensation fund that holds and distributes the money and an international claims commission to adjudicate claims—and importantly a consensus approach for utilizing the immobilized Russian sovereign assets held by the G7 and by Belgium’s Euroclear.
Russia Should Pay
There is broad international agreement that damages by wrongful state actions require compensation from the aggressor state. Despite this unified legal opinion, the G7 is divided as to whether confiscating Russian sovereign assets is the right approach to compensation. Hesitancy, particularly in Europe, appears to stem from concerns regarding Russian retaliation and from worries that confiscation might undermine the international willingness of nations and investors to hold assets denominated in the currencies of G7 countries. The retaliation fear appears unwarranted as Russia has already taken actions against investment holdings of G7-based companies within its jurisdiction. Concern about the long-term strength of the major reserve currencies is countered by the reality that central managers and investors have no significant alternatives. The long-term price may be higher if Russia is not held accountable.
REPO and PACE Taking the Lead
The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) is out front in calling for the creation of an international claims mechanism. Indeed, pursuant to its action, a registry has already been established in The Hague. In April 2024, PACE passed a unanimous resolution and recommendation calling for the seizure and transfer of Russian sovereign assets to a new Ukrainian compensation fund and the establishment of an international claims commission to adjudicate claims for compensation. Moreover, the U.S. Rebuilding Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act (REPO for Ukrainians Act, Public Law 118-50) has placed a mandate on the president to coordinate an international claims mechanism consisting of a compensation fund and a claims tribunal. When they meet in Italy in mid-June, the G7 leaders should endorse the rapid creation of an international claims commission building on the work of PACE.
Establishing a concrete mechanism that determines how the funds will be used may seem to be a daunting task. The good news is that the G7 leaders do not have to start from scratch as there are sound precedents in terms of the structure and operation of a compensation fund and claims tribunal.
Options to Make Russia Pay
The most direct approach is to confiscate all Russian sovereign assets, transfer them to an international compensation fund, and allow the fund to be allocated to approved claims. This is the approach contemplated by both the PACE actions and the new U.S. REPO law. An alternative option is for Ukraine’s allies to lend money to Ukraine and in return Ukraine would pledge as collateral a portion of its claims for war damages against Russia. Since Russia will likely decide not to cooperate, the syndicate of lenders (Ukraine’s allies) can then seize Russian sovereign assets within their jurisdictions as a setoff.
The European Union has an outsized role in making sure that Russia’s sovereign assets are utilized since it is estimated that about $229 billion of the frozen Russian sovereign assets are held in Euroclear, a Brussels-based central securities depository. Currently, a majority of EU member countries appear to support only utilizing future earnings or so-called windfall profits from these frozen Russian assets to compensate Ukraine, but not seizing the underlying assets.
Other than outright confiscation, the options that rely on lending to Ukraine backed by future earnings on frozen Russian sovereign assets may face legal headwinds related to the underlying authority for these types of transactions. If one of these novel approaches is ultimately supported by the G7, then it would be incumbent on the G7 to explain in detail the structure of the transaction and its underlying legal authority if it is to survive domestic skepticism.
The G7 appears in agreement that an international claims mechanism is necessary, but is not united on the approach to financing and so far has only been able to agree on using the interest from seized assets to fund the claims mechanism. “We are making progress in our discussions on potential avenues to bring forward the extraordinary profits stemming from immobilized Russian sovereign assets to the benefit of Ukraine,” a draft statement by the G7 finance officials said. But profits are clearly not enough and provide Russia hope that it can continue waging a war against Ukraine and have the assets unfrozen at some point. The G7 countries should not shy away from the complete transfer of assets and should emphasize the urgency and why it matters.
In general, there is broad agreement on an international claims mechanism for Ukraine consisting of three parts—a registry, a tribunal, and a compensation fund. The United Nations supported such a mechanism eight months after the full-scale invasion as the General Assembly adopted a resolution on Russian reparations in Ukraine. PACE followed similar steps when it adopted a resolution on April 16, 2024, to transfer frozen Russian assets to such a claims fund.
Iraq-Kuwait Precedent
The United Nations Compensation Commission (UNCC) was created in 1991 as a subsidiary organ of the UN Security Council in response to the damages Kuwait experienced as a result of Iraq’s invasion and occupation of its territory in 1990. The 15-member commission had a mandate to process claims and pay compensation for these losses and damages. Thirty years later (ironically on February 22, 2022, two days before Russia’s full-scale invasion), the Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution confirming that the UNCC fulfilled its mandate. As a result, 2.7 million claims were processed seeking $352 billion in compensation, and a total of $52.4 billion in damages awarded to 1.5 million claimants. The figures are expected to be much higher for Ukraine, but the Iraq-Kuwait experience offers a useful precedent. As of January 2024, Ukraine has recorded the damage or destruction of 250,000 buildings, at least 160,000 units of agricultural machinery, 16,000 units of public transport, 3,800 educational institutions, 580 administrative buildings, 426 hospitals, 348 religious institutions, 48 social centers, 31 boarding schools, and 31 shopping centers, according to the Kyiv School of Economics Institute.
The UNCC consisted of a three-part structure—the secretariat, commissioners (who reviewed and evaluated the claims submitted by entities), and a governing council which approved the compensations recommended by the panels. The UNCC also provided a set of legal definitions for damages as it established working groups of lawyers and experts of different fields on damage compensations. It also considered direct and indirect damages, as well as compensatory and punitive damages. Compensation was awarded for the repair or replacement of damaged property, medical bills, lost earnings, and reparations for physical or emotional suffering, among other things. The revenue was generated by Iraqi frozen assets and revenue from Iraqi oil exports. Overall, this was an effective mechanism.
The UNCC, in the context of the Iraqi-Kuwait invasion, is perhaps the most applicable example as it was more recent and successful. It delivered a significant amount of compensation and satisfied the objectives set at the time it was created, and it resulted in Iraqi money being used to compensate Kuwait for the unlawful invasion. Other precedents include the U.S.-Iran dispute—when in 1981 the two countries agreed through the Algiers Accords on a claims commission to settle disputes over the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran—and the Eritrea-Ethiopia claims commission, which was set up in 2000 after an armed conflict between the two nations. However, the Iraq-Kuwait example is the most applicable for Ukraine.
Critics might point out that the compensation for Kuwait happened after the war. War, however, has little influence on the compensation process as the mechanics remain the same. Furthermore, the Ukrainian example can set a precedent of a country being compensated during war. Others may say: “Why should Ukraine be the only country receiving a transfer of assets during ongoing conflict?” Ukraine could prove to be a successful example of compensation during war. It might become a deterrent for other countries contemplating aggression. As such, perhaps it would gather strong support from a broad array of nations, including in the Global South.
As with Kuwait, it is the United Nations that is assuming the authority of the international legal framework when it comes to compensating Ukraine for the damages caused by Russia’s aggression. In Ukraine’s case, however, it is the UN General Assembly that called for a claims mechanism to be established, whereas in Kuwait’s situation it was the UN Security Council. But considering that Russia is a permanent member of the Security Council, this option is not a possibility for Ukraine.
As with Kuwait, the international claims mechanism established by the United Nations for Ukraine in 2022 is expected to consist of three major components: a claims registry for damages (which the Council of Europe has already established for Ukraine), an international claims commission for adjudicating claims against Russia, and a compensation fund to hold assets for reparations and reconstruction. The Register of Damage has been accepting claims as of April 2, 2024. The claims commission and compensation fund are being considered, but there are still questions regarding their structure, process of operation, and procedures to ensure full transparency and accountability.
The Council of Europe should be mandated to play a leading role in the establishment and administration of the international claims mechanism for Ukraine, but currently there is no clear vision or strategy to bring the claims mechanism into operation since currently there is a lack of political consensus on the utilization of immobilized frozen Russian sovereign assets. G7 leaders should act now and support the full implementation of the PACE recommendations.
The Scope of Claims
An unresolved issue regarding the transfer of assets has to do with the scope of claims that the mechanism will consider for adjudication: should funds be allocated only for reconstruction or physical damage or will funds go to current budget support? Will funds go to support the Ukraine military? Who can file a formal claim—an individual, a legal entity, or only governments? Must claims relate only to damages that happened on Ukrainian territory? May claims relate back to March 2014, when the war initially started, or only to February 2022? Are all Ukrainian citizens allowed to file claims or only those Ukrainians currently residing in Ukraine? 
The Importance of the REPO for Ukrainians Act
The Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity (REPO) for Ukrainians Act included within the bipartisan national security supplemental, enacted on April 24, 2024, authorizes the U.S. president to confiscate all Russian sovereign assets in the United States for Ukraine. This new authority includes not just Russian central bank reserves, but all sovereign assets, including state-owned enterprise assets and funds and other property from U.S. financial institutions in correspondent accounts and foreign branches. REPO mandates that the president seek to coordinate with his G7 and EU counterparts on the international claims mechanism—an important aspect of the president’s overall Ukraine strategy since the full-scale invasion. The bill specifically states that the United States should coordinate with allies and partners on this issue.
The U.S. administration is looking for novel ways to provide additional funding for Ukraine at no expense to taxpayers, since the amount required to finance a Ukrainian victory is enormous. It understands that there is no guarantee that the next national security supplemental appropriations legislation will pass, considering the difficulty and delay of the last one. As the administration seeks these novel ways to find substitutes for U.S. taxpayers’ money to finance this monumental sum on a sustainable basis, the first logical approach is the use of frozen Russian sovereign assets. The REPO Act lays out a clear pathway to move forward and provides a model for other G7 and EU nations to follow. Moreover, this approach is consistent with the recent unanimous PACE recommendations. For the first time, the new law gives the president the authority to seize sovereign assets of Russians and potentially Belarusians if the president determines that they meet the criteria of an affiliated aggressor state to Russia. There also is a mandate within that authority to seize assets that also extends to reporting requirements and to coordination with allies regarding the international compensation mechanism. For example, the bill requires U.S. financial institutions to report to the U.S. government their holdings of all Russian sovereign assets. This will allow the United States to potentially identify more assets than it previously estimated.
Transparency, Accountability, and Good Governance
An effective compensation commission needs to be bullet proof from charges of corruption and abuse by ensuring full transparency, public reporting, accountability, and good governance as now required by the REPO Act in the case of the United States. These features will have to be established and overseen by an independent inspection body that ensures that these large sums are being managed fairly. If Ukraine and its partners fail to make certain that the transfer of funds is immune to corruption, then the transfer will likely not happen and needed funds will be delayed in helping Ukraine.
Settlement Consideration
The decisiveness of the G7 leaders on the transfer of frozen Russian sovereign assets to Ukraine may also be entwined with how they view the connection of the issue to ultimate settlement negotiations with Russia. If they see frozen assets as a settlement card with Russia, then the transfer may likely not happen anytime soon. The G7 leaders should be reminded of a more effective approach: if Russia sees that it is losing its frozen sovereign assets scattered in both G7 and EU nations in real time, then it is more likely that it will be forced to reconsider its current posture vis-à-vis Ukraine from both a military and economic perspective. This action will be consistent with how Russia is perceived by the international community represented in the UN General Assembly, which condemns Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and has called for full compensation for all damages. Currently, Russia believes that it can continue attacking and destroying Ukraine and go unpunished, a situation that the G7 should not allow to stand if it is sincere with respect to its full support to help Ukraine and ensure its victory in the face of Russia’s unprovoked and ongoing aggression in violation of international law.

41,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/sanam-vakil-irans-trajectory-after-raisi,Unknown,"May 29, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"Jon Alterman: Dr. Sanam Vakil is the director of Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa program, a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, and an expert on Iran-Gulf dynamics. Sanam, welcome to Babel. 
Sanam Vakil: Thanks for having me, Jon. 
Jon Alterman: After Ebrahim Raisi and Hossein Amir-Abdollahian died in a plane crash about a week ago, a lot of analysts suggested that it really wouldn't have any impact on Iranian policy, either domestically or internationally. Do you agree with that? 
Sanam Vakil: Well, yes and no. I think the truth is always somewhere in the middle, and that's because, on the one hand, the Islamic Republic is a system that is relatively cohesive. Historically, it's made up of various factions that have different policies and tactics, but together they're united in their loyalty to the Islamic Republic. Raisi himself was a very loyal insider man, not deeply charismatic or beloved by the Iranian population. He was also sort of Khamenei’s, the supreme leader, “yes man,” if you will. So those who thought that not much would change are sort of anticipating that another “yes man” will be elected to the job in the very carefully curated political process that exists in Iran. 
But the other side of the equation is that getting Raisi into the presidency hasn't been an easy or fluid process. Ebrahim Raisi has worked up and through the system. He has a very checkered and contested history. He was on a death trial in the 1980s that sent thousands of Iranians to jail. He's held close positions that indicate he is trusted within the system, but he wasn't very well known. He ran for the first time as president in 2017. Not many Iranians knew him. He didn't win, but that was sort of his first time to that sort of electoral party. 
Then he won in 2021 and became president. So, it was a process; it wasn't an immediate outcome where he was put into the job. I don’t think that there is a natural successor for Ebrahim Raisi, and that’s why we have to see his death as an opportunity for contenders and a challenge to the system.
Jon Alterman: Do you see trends already underway in Iran that really were slowed down or sped up by Raisi's death? 
Sanam Vakil: Not quite yet. I think it's still too early to say. It has been a long week, and the system has put on a lot of pomp and circumstance, really trying to commemorate his death through mourning ceremonies across the country. We saw a lot of Iranians coming out to celebrate and commemorate his life, as well as perhaps to show loyalty to the system. 
I think what we will see in the coming weeks is a carefully curated process where the system tries to show unity, as well as demonstrate it is business as usual. The next few weeks will be about candidates putting their names forward, the Guardian Council vetting those candidates, and elections to be held really quite quickly on June 28. 
Jon Alterman: You mentioned that Iran has complicated factional politics. There are a lot of contending schools often checking each other. What should we be looking for, especially in succession politics? 
Sanam Vakil: Over the past few years, Ali Khamenei has seen a conservative consolidation of power. He has overseen this process and that's what it looks like from the outside. Today, Iran’s elected and unelected institutions are all dominated by conservatives and hardline conservatives who are quite close and loyal to the supreme leader. This includes Iran’s parliament, but also, obviously, the presidency. 
How this has come about is that in previous elections, and particularly in the 2021 elections, pragmatic conservatives and reformist politicians did not pass Guardian Council vetting, and the Guardian Council vets candidates in advance of elections and makes sure they have the appropriate requirements. Loyalty to the regime and the supreme leader is among them. In that process, some key figures have been blocked from running, including longtime politicians or longtime advisors of the supreme leader, like Ali Larijani, for example.
This is how these elections are curated to determine outcomes. Going into this election, it will be interesting to see if reformists or moderates around, let's say former president Hassan Rouhani, try to run and if they're permitted to run. It’ll also be interesting to see what those from important families, like the Larijanis, or former politicians that have been marginalized or taken advisory roles, like former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, will do. These are people that are rumored to be considering throwing their hat into the ring. 
Jon Alterman: Do you see any shift imminent in the relative power of the clerical establishment versus the Revolutionary Guard? There are some people who think that the clerical establishment is likely on its way out. The Revolutionary Guard is likely to accrue more power. Of course, both groups express their loyalty to Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader. Do you see anything potentially happening here that might signal where that's headed, either because some groups make moves, some groups try to consolidate control, or some groups demonstrate their weakness? 
Sanam Vakil: I see the factions in Iran as more cohesive rather than independent, and they all are rather beholden to the Iranian supreme leader. I see the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) as very intimately connected to Ali Khamenei. They both came up, grew, and developed power and influence together. But the clergy and its hardline clerics have certainly hinged their wagons to Ali Khamenei's rise and remained influential. It's those who are reformists or pragmatists who are looking to transform the system or liberalize the system that have been marginalized. 
I don't see opportunities for those seeking transformational change to rise up in this process. But there have been suggestions from certain analysts, particularly those who would like to see a transformed or liberalized Iran, that if Ali Khamenei would like to build bridges with marginalized factions, with reformists, with former president Hassan Rouhani, this is the time to do it. 
We have to assess Ali Khamenei for his track record. He is not a compromising individual. He's quite stubborn to change, and I would be very surprised if he looks to build those kinds of bridges across the factions and with the population. Right now, this is a man who is focused on conservative consolidation and transition of the Islamic Republic, which is certainly going to be slow because he looks quite healthy. I watched a lot of videos of him over the course of the funeral, and he is quite agile and seems to be on top of his game. 
Jon Alterman: So let me ask about the foreign policy aspects of this. Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, was also in the helicopter with him. He was thought to have decent relationships with many of the Gulf leaders. He worked with them over the years, and he was an Arabic speaker. Do you see his departure from the scene having any impact on Iran's regional standing? Is Ali Bagheri Kani, the acting foreign minister, now different in some way? And is he likely to stay? 
Sanam Vakil: That's a really key point. Abdollahian wasn't well-loved across the region, but he did have that network that he has very deliberately cultivated, particularly since he became foreign minister. Those relationships, particularly in the Gulf, are important personal relationships, so he is a bigger loss for the foreign ministry. However, Ali Bagheri Kani is very ambitious. He was in charge of the nuclear negotiations and had more direct contact with American officials through the indirect negotiations taking place in Muscat. 
He won't be able to immediately build back those networks, although he will try, but he can step up and build that sort of continuity in Iran's regional dynamics, which have been the important developments for the Islamic Republic over the past few years. Ebrahim Raisi and Abdollahian have succeeded in breaking Iran out of maximum containment and for the Iranian state, those political and possible economic relationships are really important to keep the Iranian economy afloat and to build stronger political ties across the region. 
Jon Alterman: You've spent a lot of time talking to people in the Gulf about their perceptions of Iran. How do you think the Gulf states are likely to react? Are they likely to see this as more of an opportunity, more of a threat? And are there different likely reactions from different states? 
Sanam Vakil: They have different personal and interpretational views of the Islamic Republic, but most Gulf bureaucracies and leaders see the center of power and decision-making in the office of the supreme leader, so they know very well that Raisi and Abdollahian don't have that independent foreign policy dynamic. But going forward, most of them are going to continue to develop relationships across the Iranian system. It's quite difficult because there are protocols attached. 
They are going to continue to prioritize the bilateral relationships that are underway, looking to use these, sort of, nascent ties to build incremental trust. They will also use what limited leverage they have over Iran to try and temper risk and manage tension points in the relationships. These points are primarily regional and primarily over Iran's support for the axis of resistance groups, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and groups in Iraq and Syria. Gulf states see direct diplomacy with Iran as the better way forward. 
Jon Alterman: Almost exactly three years ago, you co-authored a paper that argued for the need for a regional security framework. Is that still your view? And if that is your view, how should we proceed on it? 
Sanam Vakil: It is still very much my view. The region remains one of the only areas of the world that doesn't have an architecture where countries can manage conflict and communicate all together. There are different forums that do exist. The Arab League is one, and the Gulf Cooperation Council is another. But obviously, because tensions across the Middle East have been so frayed for decades now, and the idea of bringing Iran and Israel together in a forum seems almost impossible, most of these discussions haven't resulted in any progress. 
What my co-author, Dalia Dassa Kaye, and I proposed after quite a bit of research and workshops and conversations was that regional states starting from the Gulf, as well as Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, and Iraq, can begin to work together, setting out some basic principles of non-interference and respect for sovereignty. Since all of those states now have ties either with Iran and/or Israel, they can work to manage these tensions between these two countries and gradually involve them in processes that can lower the temperature of regional tensions. 
We also propose that through the creation of what we call a Middle East forum, they can develop working groups somewhat similar to the OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) model, that focus on pragmatic areas, like climate change, emergency response, and economic ties, so these countries get to know each other, build trust, work collaboratively, and over time, perhaps find ways to include Iran and Israel. Over decades, this can bring down the temperature of tensions across the region. 
Jon Alterman: As you know, there was a perception that a lot of Arab states in the Gulf were pursuing closer ties with Israel in order to contain Iran. Certainly, the outbreak of the war in Gaza has tempered a lot of the enthusiasm for engaging with Israel. Do you think that a lot of these states are trying to maintain a balance? Do you think they still see a longer-term strategic opportunity with Israel? How do you think these states see their strategic needs going forward? And where does a perception of the United States’ future role in the region fit into that? 
Sanam Vakil: Well, it does look like there are two normalization tracks underway in the region. There's the outreach to Iran and the restoration of ties with the UAE and Saudi Arabia that have been underway for a number of years now. They're progressing slowly but steadily. There are limits to the progress, obviously, because U.S. sanctions prevent both of these countries from investing heavily in the Iranian economy, but that's perhaps a leverage point for those Gulf states. Simultaneous to that, since 2020, we have seen the UAE and Bahraini normalization with Israel. That has, of course, gained momentum with the Biden administration's doubling down on this process. I think that's still very much in the cards, but probably can't be delivered in the timelines that the Biden administration seeks to achieve. 
Over a longer period of time, most of the Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, have understood that regional stability requires a different tactic. Conflicts can't just be managed; conflicts now need to be addressed, if not solved, in order to allow the region to grow economically, particularly for countries like Saudi Arabia with Vision 2030 being so dependent on foreign direct investment. This isn't just the conflicts in Syria or Yemen, two conflicts that are just being managed and not addressed in any meaningful way, but clearly also the conflict in Palestine.
These are longer-term projects that can't quickly be addressed. However, the thinking has very much switched in the region, and that's a positive thing, but it requires a lot of investment at the leadership and bureaucratic level. The Israeli-Saudi normalization process is very much hinged to Washington, and it's from the Saudi side very much about securing guarantees from the United States. This is where it gets complex. From the Israeli side, there's a bit of overconfidence that the normalization track will always be available to them.
So, they can continue to prioritize their goals in Gaza, eliminating Hamas and addressing their security needs, without immediately biting on normalization. That's an underestimation of priorities in the Gulf, and that could slow things down over time. This was a very long-winded way of saying that these are very complex issues. But in short, what's important to note is that Israel should not estimate that Gulf states are willing to use normalization to constrain normalization on Iran. On the other hand, the Gulf States need to manage both simultaneously in order to address their economic needs.
Jon Alterman: I've heard an increasing number of Western ambassadors to Iran saying this is a regime that's in a death spiral. And the Western role should be just to make sure that when it collapses, their fingerprints aren't all over it; that this is seen as a collapse of the government rather than another external plot to control Iran's future. Do you agree with the idea that the best Western policy toward Iran right now is a policy of benign neglect? Do you think the United States should be working with allies to increase economic pressure on the government, or do you think it's better to just let this thing collapse of its own internal contradictions?
Sanam Vakil: I think the latter. I don't think that facilitating either directly or indirectly the collapse of the Iranian state is an American interest. That poses problems, particularly when there's uncertainty as to what comes next or who comes next. The United States, in my view, should prioritize constraining Iran's nuclear program, but not go out of its way to harm the state or the people. Instead, if the West subscribes to the premise that the system is going to collapse, it should give ordinary Iranians the space to try and manage what's coming next or insert themselves into what's coming next. 
I think the system is certainly going to evolve. Obviously, we just don't know when, where, and how, but this system is institutional, and so it'll be important to have key individuals in those institutions to help manage that process rather than perhaps to emulate what we saw in Iraq with a De-Ba'athification or a purge of institutions. That can be very dangerous.
Jon Alterman: How optimistic are you that acute pressure can change what the United States and its allies consider to be destabilizing Iranian actions in the region, and to what extent is it just what the Iranians will do because they are weak and see themselves as having very few tools, and the asymmetrical ones are the ones they're going to use to try to deter the United States and its allies from more extreme actions against Iran?
Sanam Vakil: The United States is in a unique moment where they have a lot of influence over Iran. What we've seen since October 7 is that Iran can be deterred. The Iranian state itself has messaged that it doesn't seek broader conflict, and it has under U.S. pressure complied with red lines coming from Washington. At the same time, it is also very clearly demonstrating through these backchannel negotiations that it wants to come to some new terms of engagement with the Biden administration, even for a few months. It is looking for some new arrangements that can be beneficial, be it monetarily or to prevent further conflict.
That strategy for the rest of 2024 should be the one on the table. Diplomacy, as well as deterrence, has long been an important balance in managing relations with adversaries. That is the way forward for now, particularly with the war in Gaza still very much underway and no real plan for what comes next. It's important not to press and trigger a broader regional conflict.
Jon Alterman: Sanam Vakil, thank you very much for joining us on Babel.
Sanam Vakil: Thank you, Jon, for having me.

42,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/summer-driving-season-gets-started,Unknown,"May 28, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS podcast published on May 28, 2024. Listen to the podcast here.
Tom Kloza: The presidential administration has very, very little impact on what happens to prices. We've seen what we've seen in the last two years because the Ukraine War and other facets that are multinational. So this idea that the administration in charge has a lot to do with fruit oil prices or gasoline prices is pretty myopic.
Lisa Hyland: Hello and welcome to Energy 360, the podcast from the CSIS Energy Security and Climate Change Program. I'm your host, Lisa Hyland. It's the Tuesday after Memorial Day, the unofficial start to summer and the summer driving season in the United States. As we head into June and July, millions of Americans will drive to their vacation spots. So this week we dig into what gasoline prices in the United States might look like this summer with expert Tom Kloza. Tom is global head of energy analysis at Oil Price Information Services and an expert on U.S. gas prices. Tom joins Ben Cahill to discuss what domestic and what international factors can impact gas prices and they provide insights into those market dynamics. I'll turn it over to Ben now to lead off the conversation.
Ben Cahill: Alright, Tom Kloza, thank you so much for joining us on the podcast today.
Tom Kloza: Happy to be here.
Ben Cahill: We are here to talk about U.S. gasoline prices and you were the first person I thought of to talk about this topic, so we'll get into what's going on in the market in a minute, but maybe first you could just briefly introduce yourself and Opus and what you do.
Tom Kloza: Sure. I've been around forever, almost, I suppose, to the dawn of fossil fuels. I was among people that started Opus back in 1980 and at the time we just tracked wholesale prices, but now we are the repository for retail prices throughout the United States and actually in quite a few foreign countries as well. If you get in a car that has retail prices somehow worked into the connected car, it's likely you're getting them from some sort of an opus service.
Ben Cahill: So you are the go-to organization for retail prices and what's going on at various levels of retail and distribution, not only in the U.S. but in other countries too.
Tom Kloza: Even though I can't pump my own gas here in New Jersey where it's the one state that doesn't allow it, I do claim some sort of expertise on this. And by the way, there is no effort in New Jersey to allow people to pump their own gas. It is dead in the water at the moment.
Ben Cahill: Well, that's very reassuring. Good to know. I always wonder about that when I pass through the turnpike and have my gas pumped for me. Okay, Tom, so we're recording this just before Memorial Day. This is of course the unofficial start of the driving season in the United States. It is typically the time when people start to freak out about gasoline prices and there's intense folks on where they're headed over the summer. So a simple question to start us off, is it true that gasoline prices usually increase after Memorial Day, during peak summer demand and why?
Tom Kloza: No, it's not, and there is a lot of myth and legend that's attached to gasoline prices. The most mythical aspect is that Memorial Day starts to drive in season. It's more of a dress reversal for those 10 weeks that come when all the schools let out and we'll see pretty brisk demand for gasoline this week, but we'll probably get a little day in a month after that where we won't be using nearly as much for the first few weeks of June. But people do get excited about it. They view high gas prices the way I view the Dallas Cowboys. It just annoys the hell out of me, and that's something that's unique to sort of the American perspective these days.
Ben Cahill: Okay, so the 10 week driving period, I guess starting in June and then what into early August, you're saying?
Tom Kloza: Right. The first half of August is really the peak period and we don't use nearly as much as we did. There was one week where we used 10 million barrels a day of gasoline as measured by the Energy Information Administration. These days, if you use 9 million barrels a day, that tends to be fairly brisk and so far this year we're actually using about one and a half to 2% less than we were last year, and that puts us at about five or 600,000 barrels a day less than what we used back before the pandemic.
Ben Cahill: Yeah, okay. And how do refineries prepare for the summer? Can you talk about some of the technical configurations they have to make and how that affects pricing?
Tom Kloza: There typically is a rally between the winter and the spring, and that rally is helped by refinery maintenance. Refineries are like NASCAR cars that have to take a pit stop and they tend to take those pit stops in March and April. The good news is that we've completed most of the refinery maintenance, including on the west coast where there was a real element of risk tied to not having enough gasoline. So in the next few weeks or so, we'll start to see U.S. refineries run about 17 million barrels a day of crude in feed stock, and I think one of the things they have to worry about for the first part of the summer is making a little bit too much gasoline. When you get into the middle of the summer, you get into August and it's a much higher demand period, and you get threats from hurricanes, tropical weather, and extreme temperatures. It can be a little bit different, but over the next few weeks, I think refiners have to worry about maybe making a little bit more than the market can stand. Now they're help in fact that exports these days tend to run about 700,000 barrels a day. If you go back to Katrina in 2005 when we were exporting virtually no gasoline then and certainly no crude oil, so things have changed pretty dramatically.
Ben Cahill: So if there's excess supply, some of it can be kept as, I guess commercial inventories. Some can be exported, but it's better to air on the side of producing too much.
Tom Kloza: I mean, exports are kind of the untold story. If you remember, the old ads with ADM, I think it was supermarket to the world, we're like refiner to the world, and particularly to the world of Latin America and the Caribbean. They've lost refining capacity in the last 10 years, and thanks to the fact that we have very cheap natural gas at Gulf Coast states and a lot of refining capacity, they're the outlet for a lot of the excess gasoline that the U.S. produces.
Ben Cahill: Okay, so we have to talk about prices. Where are we today? What's your outlook for the summer and what can drivers expect?
Tom Kloza: Well, we've got average prices of about 360 right now, but there's a tremendous difference between the lower prices. We've got about 6% of sites below $3, and then you've got the high numbers in California, some of the western states above five dollars again, and that'll probably continue if you're serviced by the Gulf Coast, Texas, Louisiana, you'll probably see gas relief prices really for the most of the next few weeks. The good news in Western states is they've come through a little bit of a crisis with a lot of refining downtime and because of the higher prices, we're not necessarily using as much gasoline in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Pacific Northwest, so we're in good shape. If you liked last year with the prices, you're probably going to like this year, I've compared it to a Bactrian camel. We had one hump where prices went up in April and we probably peaked for the first half of the year. I think we might see a second hump with a peak and it would be very, very contingent upon what happens in the tropics and in the Gulf of Mexico.
Ben Cahill: Yeah, okay. I want to get into some of those macro drivers of oil price and the connection with retail prices in a bit, but let me just ask a basic question for people who don't know the downstream space as well. You've already mentioned this huge regional variation in gasoline and diesel prices around the country. I mean, in a way it's not surprising. United States is a huge country, right? You've got demand centers dispersed across the country often very far from production and refining capacity, but can you just tell us in simple terms, why is there such a big spread between fuel prices across the us what really drives it at the regional level?
Tom Kloza: Sure. We're probably one or two refinery short of a balanced market in the western third of the country, and that's a bottom line issue. The Northeast is very dependent upon gasoline that comes from Louisiana and Texas and also from offshore. If you're part of the Gulf Coast or you're market served by that, we've got a really, really robust refining system, and that really is, I remember in earth and space science as a kid that's in the weather is the uneven heating of the earth. I think there's a lot of petroleum weather in terms of the disparities and it's tied to that uneven distribution of refineries. We have more than enough refining at the U.S. Gulf Coast and probably in the mid continent. The west coast is a bit short in the Northeast is a bit short, particularly if we don't get some of the cargoes of gasoline that we depend on from Europe.
Ben Cahill: And just to track that, I mean, how do the west coast and East coast deal with this lack of refining capacity? What's the impact of that?
Tom Kloza: Well, about a month ago we saw gasoline prices X tax in California, Northern California. They were trading at over $60 more than the price accrued. That's changed, and it's about $30 now. But if you compare that to mid-cycle numbers for Gulf Coast refineries, you're probably talking about a typical margin for gasoline is like 10 to $15 a barrel. We haven't seen typical for about three years because of the war in Ukraine and because of intense heat that really sack the country of some refining last year during the high usage months.
Ben Cahill: Yeah. Well, let's dig into some of the things that are driving the price today. I think you've already mentioned macro issues like geopolitical risk and supply demand balances. I mean, obviously there are big things that happen in the crude oil market and then there are things that are specific to refining capacity and refining dynamics and retail and distribution. I mean, again, a simple question, but can you help explain how changes in the global crude price really translate into changes in dynamics and prices at the pump for the consumer?
Tom Kloza: Sure. What I'd like to look at and given an example is last October we went up to $90 again for the price accrued, and I noticed a tremendous difference between that $90 crude price and where things were and what it was in 2007, the first time we crossed that threshold, the whole business has become much, much more profitable. Refiners that typically would make 10 to $15 on manufacturing. Gasoline now can make 20, 30, 40 even in excess of $50. And then there's the markup for retailers. The first time we crossed $90 for crude, but the typical margin for a gasoline retailer in the country was about 17 cents. Nowadays, as I'm speaking to you today, it's about 50 cents this week. So everything is more profitable within the realm of the downstream petroleum business. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that that's the new norm, but there are bigger margins for wholesale, bigger margins for retail, and certainly when we tend to expand, we expand much further than we did 10 years ago.
Ben Cahill: What's driving those larger margins?
Tom Kloza: Well, the lack of some global refining. It's interesting because almost every day now, I get up and I hear about drone attacks in Russia from Ukraine, and I would say that it's probably very common to get at least one or two drone attacks each week. Gasoline. It's a global market, and if we lose some of the Russian supply to Turkey, China, India, it's going to tighten up gasoline globally. So that's a real wild card this year. The other thing I would emphasize is that the population adds about a billion people every 12 years or so, but we're really not adding to refining. I mean, people are talking about refining sunsets and moving away from internal combustion vehicles by 2035, but in the meantime, we're adding a lot of drivers, particularly in the emerging markets, and we're not adding refine. There's a couple of big refineries that are being talked about these days in Nigeria, the Dangote Refinery and in Mexico to Dos Bocas, and it doesn't look as though they're going to be contributing anything to world markets until 2025 or later.
Ben Cahill: Yeah, I mean, I think one trend we've seen with global refinery additions in the last couple of years is that it's been centered in Asia and the Middle East and in Asia, a lot of this is China. A lot of that is kind of combined petrochemicals and refining capacity and a small handful of big refineries in the Middle East and now the Dangote Refinery in Nigeria, but at the same time, you've got refineries closing and a lot of the OECD markets, right?
Tom Kloza: Yeah. We're only about 300 days until the Houston Refinery operated by Lionell closes, and that'll be very interesting because we don't see necessarily that much deterioration in demand, particularly with the United States supplying Latin America, and that refinery, I guess, closes March 31st, 2025. So, mark your calendar. That's a circle on the calendar for sure.
Ben Cahill: So, what's driving the refinery closures in the U.S. and other OECD markets then?
Tom Kloza: Well, I think that probably if it's a question of a stranded asset, I think most refinery operators will act to close the refinery as opposed to having as a stranded asset down the road. Having said that, I think they were too active in closing refineries on the west coast back during the covid year marathon and then subsequently Phillips closing their Northern California markets. That's a crazy market, and if that loses a refinery to earthquake fire power outage or whatever, those prices could go absolutely parabolic very, very quickly. We're fighting is a sleepy business. They don't fetch numbers in the equities market that are, well, certainly nothing like Nvidia, but it's a sleepy but very, very prosperous business. And again, I think there's that worry about if you do get enough of these ice bands that you're going to have stranded assets in part of the country. But make no mistake about it, for the last three years, refining has been a wonderfully profitable business and in the United States, think about the fact that our natural gas prices tend to be under $2 per million BTU, and when you operate a refinery, it helps to have cheap natural gas because you also need to create hydrogen to run your desulfurization equipment. So the refineries, I refer to the United States as the privileged continent for operating refining, and I think that'll continue for a while.
Ben Cahill: Yeah, that's really interesting. Maybe you can talk about how the refining complex in the United States has changed, especially over the past decade with the shale revolution and the huge increase in oil and gas production in the United States, but particularly the huge growth of white sweet crude. I mean, my understanding, the layman's understanding is that we've kind of pushed as much into the refinery complex as it can accommodate in terms of light suite and all the excess has to be exported. Is that true? How has the refining complex kind of adjusted to this change and crude slates?
Tom Kloza: Well, despite the fact that most people think, wow, gasoline is the real money maker for refiners, it's not. They tend to make more money on diesel and jet fuel, and those are high growth products. There is a mismatch of crude oil right now with all the light sweet shale crude. Those crude oil blends tend to yield an awful lot of light ends, whether it be gasoline or naptha or some of the LPGs. And again, the margins for those fuels are nowhere near as lucrative as the margins for diesel and jet fuel. When OPEC plus engineered its last round of cuts, of course the Saudis took that 1 million barrel a day cut in Arab light. Arab light is a real misnomer. It's not a light crude that has necessarily a very, very high yield of gasoline and LPG. It tends to be a distillate rich crude, and that's the kind of crude that most people would like. So at some point as we ramp up to runs and we go over 17 million barrels a day, and we saw this last year, gasoline can become the loss leader. You're going to be making more of it as a refiner than you really would prefer to do. You'd like to make a little bit more diesel heating oil jet fuel, but until we get that Arab light back or until we see some of the heavier crudes on the market from Venezuela, Iraq, Iran, there is this mismatch and that's going to persist for a while.
Ben Cahill: Yeah, that's interesting. I was talking with someone about that recently, particularly in the Atlantic Basin, and there does seem to be this glut of white sweet crude and the OPEC plus cuts have created this kind of a gap with the heavier and medium crude and those just distillate rich ones.
Tom Kloza: I think the Giana output is going to be very, very helpful because my understanding is that I'm not an expert in crude oil assays is that that'll be a medial kind of a heavy bodied fruit. I talk about fruit sometimes like it's a cabernet or whatever, but you want that body and you want something with that robust output of diesel.
Ben Cahill: Yeah. One question that comes up often in policy world here in Washington is concern about the fact that the U.S. has become a huge exporter of fossil fuels for many reasons, but I think there is this persistent concern that by exporting oil or natural gas liquids or petroleum products, it will therefore drive up prices for the U.S. consumer. And I would love a clear explanation of why that is not the case and what is the relationship really between the U.S. becoming a huge exporter of crude and the prices that the typical consumer sees at the pump?
Tom Kloza: Well, I would maintain that exports are a real, real important safety valve, and if we didn't have a big export market to Latin American particular, we'd see a lot of refinery enclosures because they're not going to basically be able to sustain on U.S. demand and U.S. demand is being destroyed to a certain extent. It's a very slow burn. We're about one point a half percent below last year for gasoline. I think it's a real dangerous policy issue to try to say, we need to keep these barrels at home because we want cheap gasoline here. I would submit that probably there's no better balance of payments right now than looking at what we're exporting in terms of hydrocarbons to the rest of the world. Now with that comes incredible risk. We've all grown up with the notion that the most dangerous choke point in the world is straight of four moose.
Well number two now, and I mean a close number two is the Gulf of Mexico. We've seen exports of hydrocarbons probably top 12 billion barrels a day quite often in the last few years. And if you look at hurricane season and you look at the water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic, that means that a category three, four or five storm in the Gulf of Mexico is going to have incredible global ramifications. And as somebody that lives in Fort Myers for seven months of the year, I really don't want to see a hurricane again because that last one was pretty frightening.
Ben Cahill: Yeah, I mean, it's a good point. I think the risk of hurricanes to the whole refining complex on the Gulf Coast and also the LNG industry is always there. It's ever present.
Tom Kloza: Beyond the actual impact of hurricanes. You have this other phenomenon. You have the storm chasing. You'll start to see the stories about hurricanes and likelihood and probabilities, and there will be a portion of the market, whether they're money managers or funds that will buy gasoline options are above options or futures or whatever on the premise that I need to be protected if we do get a category three or greater storm in the Gulf. So it creates its own real unique dynamics.
Ben Cahill: That's interesting. So let's return to the market. You mentioned, I think that there's been this gradual decline in gasoline demand in the United States. Prices seem to be kind of tracking where they were last year, not a huge change from last summer, at least at the outset of the season. Talk a little bit in more detail about what we can expect and what do you see as the upside and downside risks?
Tom Kloza: Sure. I think under most circumstances, and I've made some references to other can, but under most circumstances, we're going to see gasoline prices behave like they did last year. In the last year we had a couple of peaks of about 360, 370, but much, much higher numbers out west, and those higher West Coast numbers are going to persist. I would say that if we don't get a hurricane event or a tropical storm event, that we will see appreciably lower gasoline prices in the last a hundred days of the year. People think that it's politics and the Biden administration like the gods of Mount Olympus stirring things, but it really has nothing to do with the fact other than we're going to see a lot more fruit come on in the second half of this year. Refineries should be healthy, and you also have that change in the recipe where you can pack gasoline with a lot of cheap hydrocarbons like butane once you get to September. So there's a reason why gasoline prices tend to always drop between labor day and election day, and it doesn't have to do with politics.
Ben Cahill: That's a good thing to keep in mind. And in terms of the crude oil market, it still seems like it's relatively well supplied. I mean, OPEC buses had cuts in place since late 2022. There's another meeting coming up on June 1st, the voluntary cuts, they'll have to make a decision about that at some point in June, but right now, non OPEC supply is pretty robust. It's hard to look at this market and see it tightening that much of the months to come.
Tom Kloza: Yeah, it's always difficult to get a real sense of crude in a market where demand and supply tend to be about a hundred million barrels a day and departure from that really has a big impact. I would suggest that right now, the structure of the market where you're seeing cargoes West African crude or North Sea crude trading at 80 cents under the futures price, I would suggest that the structure is telling you that it's plentiful supply for the moment. We'll see what they do when they meet on June 1st, but right now it looks as though they need to probably have further cuts. And again, August is the high demand month, and you have less salt fruit on the market in July and August because of the need to generate air conditioning. So that goes away in the last a hundred days of the year, and that makes it pretty easy to suggest that you're going to see lower prices in October, November, and December than what we see in the summer.
Ben Cahill: Yeah, interesting. Well, Tom, as you mentioned, you've been at this game for a long time. What is one thing that you wish more people knew about gasoline prices or energy system in the United States as someone has looked at downstream in retail, what does the general public not know that they should know about how things work?
Tom Kloza: I think what they would be book them to know this would be that the president actual administration has very, very little impact on what happens to prices. I mean, we've seen what we've seen in the last two years because the Ukraine War and other facets that are multinational or whatever. So this idea that the administration in charge has a lot to do with fruit oil prices or gasoline prices is pretty myopic now. In 2022 when we released 160 or 180 million barrels of fruit from the SPR, I think that was a big deal too, but you've got a lot of misinformation there. People think, oh my goodness, the strategic petroleum reserve, we're basically going to give up our energy security. They don't realize that between the United States, Canada and Mexico, that accounts for about 17 or 18 million barrels gave crude oil. So this notion, which really started in the seventies, that were dependent on foreign countries, many of whom have a bad relationship with us for crude oil, it needs to be retired. I would submit that the SPR to a great extent is an anachronism these days.
Ben Cahill: Yeah, I mean, that's interesting. There's certainly no doubt that the role of the U.S. and the global energy system has changed dramatically in the last 10 years plus.
Tom Kloza: Right. I mean, if we were to have hostilities with Canada, and maybe that'll happen if they keep sending us people like Justin Bieber, it would be different, but as long as we don't go to war with Canada or Mexico, I think we're pretty comfortable.
Ben Cahill: Yeah. I think more than 60% of U.S. GTO imports come from Canada.
Tom Kloza: Right.
Ben Cahill: Great. Well, Tom, this has been great. When this topic came up and we were batting it around, I thought there's no one better to explain this and be entertaining at the same time, which you always are, and I appreciate that. So thank you so much for joining us on the podcast today. I really enjoyed it.
Tom Kloza: Thanks. Thanks for having me. I hope I didn't filibuster too much.
Lisa Hyland: Thanks Tom for joining us this week. You can find more episodes of Energy 360 wherever you listen to podcasts and at csis.org. Follow us on LinkedIn and X for updates from our team. As always, thanks for listening.

Stephen Morrison: Good morning, good afternoon, good evening. I’m J. Stephen Morrison, senior vice president here at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, CSIS, in Washington, D.C. This is the 12th episode of our broadcast series Gaza: The Human Toll. It’s a production of the CSIS Bipartisan Alliance for Global Health Security. And it’s a partnership that’s done in collaboration with the CSIS Middle East Program and the CSIS Humanitarian Agenda. Today’s focus is U.S. policy on the health and humanitarian crisis in Gaza. What are the options looking ahead?
We’re delighted to have with us today David Satterfield and Nick Schifrin as our featured guests.
David is a retired senior career diplomat, very distinguished record, who served extensively in the Middle East. President Biden appointed him in October as a special envoy for humanitarian issues in Gaza. He stepped down from that position recently and is now a senior adviser on Middle East issues. His day job is as director of Rice University’s James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy. David, thank you for being with us. It’s great to have you with us here today.
Nick Schifrin is PBS NewsHour’s foreign affairs and defense correspondent. Coverage under his watch on the Gaza since the October 7th Hamas massacre and the subsequent war has been absolutely sterling. Earlier in his career, while working for Al Jazeera, he covered the Gaza war in 2014. Nick, thanks so much for being with us.
And I’m delighted to be joined again by my colleagues Michelle Strucke, director of the CSIS Humanitarian Agenda and our Human Rights Initiative; and Jon Alterman
, senior vice president, and director of our Middle East Program. Special thanks to Sophia Hirshfield for pulling this together; and our – and our terrific production team, Eric Ruditskiy and Dwayne Gladden.
Today there’s, frankly, not much good news to report on the war and peace issues, humanitarian and health crises. It’s difficult to imagine a more bleak and discouraging place to be, eight months into the war. And options for the future remain somewhat unclear and few in number. It seems we’ve entered a phase of escalating violence and kinetic military action born of the IDF’s eviction orders two weeks ago, the enduring Rafah military – ensuing Rafah military operation, and renewed fighting in the north. Hamas continuously shelled the Kerem Shalom gate May 6th to 16th, and there’s continued Hamas embedment in civilian institutions, including schools and medical facilities, and use of civilians as human shields.
In just two weeks, the Rafah military campaign and renewed fighting in the north has triggered mass movement of over 1 million civilians, displaced into utterly horrific conditions. And in the meantime, it’s become exceptionally dangerous for humanitarians to work inside Gaza. There’s still no effective deconfliction mechanisms in place and the flow of goods has ground to a halt, except for modest private sector flows. Gates are closed and then opened only minimally. And there are acute and mounting shortages of food, fuel, water, medicines. As we knew before this began, starvation is happening in the north and the prediction now is that we’re going to see famine across Gaza.
Egypt has entered this conflict, in closing the Kerem Shalom gate in retaliation against IDF actions to control the southern corridor on the Egyptian border. The DOD pier announced in the president’s State of the Union address arrived last week and began its operations on Friday, at a cost of 320 million (dollars). It still remains to be seen whether that can bring relief at scale to those who need it, and whether or not the efforts at bringing into force some kind of deconfliction mechanism can work. We’ll be talking today about the fact that the big end game remains elusive in terms of trying to achieve a ceasefire, release of hostages, humanitarian access, and plans for day-after governance and realignment within the region of new alliances.
We’re focused here on what U.S. policy options are, looking ahead, to address the humanitarian health crisis. Obviously, that requires us to talk about many other things.
I just want to make one note that U.S. policy has remarkably attracted criticism from all directions, and it has become embedded in our own presidential elections. It has divided the Democratic Party. It has triggered responses in various places, including the Trump administration and Republican leaders in Congress. That’s rather – that is rather remarkable.
We also will talk I’m sure here today about the decision by the ICC to request warrants – arrest warrants for Prime Minister Netanyahu, Defense Minister Gallant, and three Hamas military and political leaders. We’ll hear more about that.
I want to ask our speakers today to kick off this discussion around what are the options here. That, of course, encompasses its conditionality, which we’ve debated out over the last months. Is that – is it too late to consider conditionality in new forms? Do we simply have to wait for the – for the Rafah operation to be completed, or are we at some breaking point where perhaps other more radical steps have to be considered? Many of the routine matters about opening gates, about deconfliction – all of those issues still remain.
So we’re going to hear from our speakers in quick succession, and then we’re going to have a conversation flow from that. David, I’d like to ask you to kick things off, please. Thank you for your service.
Ambassador David Satterfield: Thank you very much, and I’m happy to be here.
The title for this series of events has been human tolls, so I’ll start with that, but there is another critical dimension which does impact the human toll. We had seen a progressive improvement in the ability to deliver, through land corridors, which are always the most efficient and effective way to get assistance into Gaza, increasing quantities in an increasingly consistent, sustainable fashion of humanitarian assistance, not just into the center itself where the bulk of the population – pre-Rafah operation – were living, but also into the north, which for so long had been denied the ability to be supplied or even to have credible, comprehensive assessments made of the situation there – the humanitarian situation.
That progressive improvement, which the opening of the JLOTS maritime corridor, was seen as an adjunct to – not a substitute for, but an adjunct to – was certainly reversed with the initiation of the Rafah operation. It is, as you have noted, extremely difficult for the international humanitarian actors – NGOs, the U.N. in all of its dimensions – to consistently move, at scale, assistance into the center itself. This is not just a question – I don’t even think it’s primarily a question of physical danger or classical deconfliction. It is congestion, it is the introduction of very significant quantities of commercial goods, which are moving on only – now – a very limited number of roads. It makes it very difficult to do two critical things: first, to move the kind of specialized feeding assistance that’s needed to deal with malnutrition, with wasting, with infant and young child mortality and morbidity to all the places where that is needed. It has interfered with the ability of the humanitarian community to make accurate assessments.
If you ask me, so is there starvation, is there famine in center and south Gaza, or in the north, that’s a very difficult question to answer. We can certainly acknowledge the extraordinary risk, and it’s a risk that has increased dramatically since the 6th of May and the initiation of the operation. But the precise details of what’s going on, and thus the means needed to specifically address them, are very hard to come by, and that is all a product of the kinetic operation and the displacements that have taken place.
But I want to not pivot from but to add to that discussion, with humanitarian dimension, the real question, which is strategic – strategic for the U.S., strategic for the fate of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, and the region as a whole, which is the day after, the madha baed (ph), the what after, as it would be referred to in Arabic.
What is the day after? Now when I’m asked the question, in my previous role, I said, well, you know, my job is to make sure there is a day before that permits a day after to be contemplated. But the real issue here is can there be a security, a political, administrative reset in Gaza that does not allow Hamas passively or actively to remain, to resume, being the effective governing authority.
Because if that’s the case then all of this – all of the sacrifices, all of the humanitarian crisis, the Israeli dead – all of this will not have produced a positive strategic outcome not just for Israel but for all of us and for the region as a whole.
Hamas is deeply embedded in Gaza far more than any of us assumed when this campaign began. Its military strength, not a terrorist gang but a terrorist army 30,000 strong in tunnels hundreds of kilometers long at depth, this was beyond what was anticipated.
And I’ll just make a final comment, because we can talk about all of this during the dialogue, is nobody has fought a campaign like this. We haven’t. Israel hasn’t. No modern army has done this.
It’s a campaign above ground and below ground. It’s a campaign against a deeply entrenched, very well equipped, very coherent military – it’s a terrorist military but it’s a military more than a gang – and it’s done in a compacted compressed space where the terrorist force has had 16, 17 years to deliberately embed itself in, under, around not just civilian infrastructure but humanitarian infrastructure as well.
That was a deliberate strategic act on the part of Hamas, the consequences of which are the very grave, very serious humanitarian consequences images that we’ve all seen over these seven months.
This is really hard but the outcome matters. It matters to the U.S. It matters to every state in the Middle East. It matters to Israel and Israelis and it matters to Palestinians.
Dr. Morrison: Thank you, David.
Nick?
Nick Schifrin: Well, I just want to say thank you, Stephen, and thank you for asking me to join this panel and, frankly, I’d be more interested in asking all you questions.
And as Ambassador Satterfield just very, very well pointed out how difficult both the human toll and the strategic questions are and so I don’t intend to quibble at all with what Ambassador Satterfield raised and so, perhaps, I can add just a couple of extra points on top of what he said. As someone who as a policymaker once put me down saying, well, I peddle in anecdotes, so perhaps I’ll peddle a few anecdotes and see if they’re helpful.
The first thing is I’ll start where Ambassador Satterfield left off which is the idea of Hamas in Gaza and why this is so difficult. It is not just that Hamas has strategically made a decision to embed itself inside Gaza. Hamas has become part of Gaza and Gaza has become part of Hamas, and what I mean by that is, you know, I spent not only seven weeks in Gaza in 2014 during wartime but many weeks before that during peacetime – relative peacetime – and then since then multiple trips ’16, ’18, and ’20 during wars and before wars is that you don’t meet a family who is anti-Hamas or pro-Hamas.
Hamas is just within the family, whether it’s because there’s a member of the family who works for the government, right, whose salaries are paid for by the Palestinian Authority, and we can talk about Israel and Bibi’s own history with that, or is a fighter or is a militant, right, who has a particular opinion about Israel and, therefore, wants to fight and the idea of separating Hamas from the population of Gaza is just never going to happen and I think Israeli officials, certainly military officials I’ve talked to over the years, would agree with that.
But the challenge that they are faced by October the 7th by the nature of the attack is such that the Israelis have had to fight. The closest thing we’ve done to that is in Mosul and Fallujah. And so what Netanyahu has argued and with specific numbers more recently is the ratio is one to one. We have killed as many militants as we have civilians.
The problem with that is twofold. One, that means you’ve killed 14(,000) or 15,000 civilians as the world watches, right. This is not even Mosul and Fallujah where, frankly, there wasn’t daily coverage. Whether it was because of ABC News or Al Jazeera, just the nature of the fight didn’t allow daily coverage or the editors didn’t invite it.
This is daily, nightly, coverage both on social media and on primetime television in America and we need to acknowledge the impact that’s having. So that’s the first problem.
The second half – and the chair and the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee just made this intelligence public and, you know, Ambassador Satterfield knows more about this than we do, but if the ratio is 1:1, that means Israel has killed half or less than half of Hamas. And the chairman and the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee made public that they have taken out less than half the tunnels. So here we are, however many months later, with the toll immense and the challenge is so large that even the IDF could only achieve that. And so that leads to the question, all right – the phrase is Yiddish is oubriete (ph) – now what, right? Now what, smart guy? And that leads to the question of OK, well, how are you going to defeat Hamas and what is the political solution? And there are actually options on the table for Bibi, for the region, for the international community, and I’m sure we’ll talk about that.
One last point about famine and about opinions. Ambassador Satterfield, again, laid out better than I can or anybody can how difficult it is for the humanitarians to work and therefore how difficult it is for them to really know what’s happening. But we have a looming deadline or a looming prediction that the umbrella organizations that declare famine have said within days, by the end of the month, there could be famine in northern Gaza. Man-made famines are rare, right, and they’re incredibly unpopular – (laughs) – I mean, that’s almost like a stupid thing to say, but, you know, the national security adviser has pointed this out to Netanyahu and his team, and I’m sure other U.S. officials have pointed out multiple times, the creation of famine in Gaza is very bad for the Palestinians, very bad for Israel, very bad for Israel’s allies and partners, and that could be coming very, very soon. Cindy McCain, executive director of the World Food Programme, basically gave her opinion recently and said there is full-blown famine, but the umbrella organization that could declare that could do so soon. And on top of the diplomatic pressure on Israel, that would just be an extraordinary thing to say that in the 21st century a war has created famine among, you know, hundreds of thousands of people and that is really – could be looming.
Dr. Morrison: Thank you. Thank you very much.
Michelle?
Michelle Strucke: Thank you for having me today. You know, picking up on that point on the man-made famine issue, Samantha Power, the USAID administrator, has said there is famine. Cindy McCain has said there is famine. The IPC indicators cross the threshold that would allow the U.N. to declare a famine.
Mr. Schifrin: IPC is that umbrella organization that I was talking about, yeah.
Ms. Strucke: Yeah. So but – well, the United Nations. So the United Nations – there’s the independent and impartial committee that does the kind of fact checking but they never declare a famine; it’s not their role. The U.N. can declare it, the State Department can make a determination. Those things haven’t happened, but that doesn’t mean that there isn’t very concerning evidence. I think no one is disputing, except the Israeli government who says there’s no famine and there’s no humanitarian crisis – are not disputing it. And I think that point is significant because, to me, as a person who worked in humanitarian organizations, that worked in humanitarian assistance with the U.S. government, the kind of humanitarian, almost diplomatic gaslighting that is happening, where humanitarian organizations, professional, impartial, independent organizations that are not only receiving U.S. taxpayer money to put their lives at risk to go and deliver aid in Gaza are then also being told by authorities that there’s not really a problem here. I take issue with that. I think that’s an important thing to put on the table because they have staff that are, again, putting their lives in harm’s way and they’re encountering incredible problems on the ground in distribution of aid, in deconfliction, because, as much as – with respect to Ambassador Satterfield, you’re saying it’s not physical safety. I think that the lives of more than 190 U.N. staff being taken in this conflict, a historic number of journalists and aid workers that, frankly, don’t feel safe is indicating that there is an issue with physical safety that continues, as they’re trying to navigate the operational obstacles of having to deliver aid under these circumstances.
And I will say, too, that the interesting part – you know, the fact that the DOD-created pier was made to augment other aid delivery mechanisms, and you said that quite well, that is a really important point, but I think it kind of hides a contradiction that we should look at, which is that $320 million of U.S. taxpayer money spent on this pier is a significant number. The U.S. DOD budget for humanitarian assistance, the OHDACA account, usually every year is about 130 million (dollars). And that’s for global support to humanitarian response, and disasters, and demining efforts. So to take 320 million (dollars) – and I don’t know if all the funds are coming from that. I imagine that it’s from other parts of DOD as well. But that is a significant sum.
And that – $320 million – so almost – so more than doubling the amount that the U.S. usually spends per year on U.S. military support to humanitarian assistance, the fact that that is happening demonstrates, I think, not only the political will by the U.S. government to try to get humanitarian aid in themselves, but it also demonstrates proof that aid – not enough aid is flowing into Gaza, which is causing the U.S. government to have to take what are essentially extraordinary measures to provide an augmented channel which, as we’ve seen in the last few days, is simply not effective because of issues on the ground, like deconfliction, like distribution efforts that are – that are hindered.
So it’s contradictory, on the one hand, to say that there – you know, there is no humanitarian crisis, that there is no famine happening – which is, again, what the Israeli authorities and War Cabinet members continue to say – while still saying that they’re attempting to get aid inside and opening up every channel they can. And for the U.S. government, you know, I think what we’ve seen on the – your question on what do we do going forward? What are the policy solutions? The U.S. has demonstrated that when they’ve taken more decisive action on the security cooperation side to us that, use its leverage in private – in private negotiations, but then also increasingly in public view, that has spurred decisive humanitarian action by the Israeli government.
They’ve opened more border crossings. They’ve looked at different options. They’ve tried to start to do things like pave roads to allow aid to get in, or themselves pursue actions. It’s really important that the U.S. continues, as they did in NSM-20, the national security memorandum we discussed before, to look at using the tools in their toolkit, including limiting particularly offensive weapons going to the IDF, as a means to pressure them, this very important ally, to allow humanitarian assistance to come in. And to – and to face the facts, to admit the facts.
So I’ll stop there, but I think it’s a very important discussion of what is the suite of tools that should be used by the U.S. government to push for more concessions, especially as we have escalation in Rafah which, as you mentioned is a catastrophic escalation, on the table.
Dr. Morrison: Thanks, Michelle.
Jon.
Dr. Alterman: Yeah, I agree with a lot of things that have been said very articulately. But I think the other element, and David knows is much better than I do, is working through differences with Democratic partners who have the public support of their population, is a different kind of problem than what we’d like to do in other places. Oftentimes, democratic partners, we’re all aligned. The G-7, we’re all aligned. We see the world a lot the same way. Sometimes we don’t. The British thought we were crazy about the Iraq War. They made their own decision and were criticized for supporting us in the Iraq War.
But I think that the challenge that we have is Prime Minister Netanyahu is not a right-wing crazy, in Israeli political terms. And I think people actually overestimate the extent to which he’s being trapped by his right-wing allies. I think he has a remarkable sense for where the center of Israeli politics is. Israelis remain deeply traumatized by the events of October 7th, as we were traumatized for years by the events of September 11th. The Israeli – the Hebrew language press in Israel has almost no coverage of any kind on the humanitarian consequences in Gaza. And there is no Israeli public demand to meet the humanitarian needs in Gaza.
Instead, it’s talking about our martyrs, talking about our heroes, talking about the need to uproot Hamas decisively, permanently, notwithstanding what Nick has said about the fact that that’s not really doable. But that’s where the public is. I think Netanyahu appeals to that notion, to that logic. The last poll I’ve seen said that about 48 percent of Israelis agree with Gallant’s idea there has to be a plan. About 34 percent agree with Netanyahu’s argument that first we win and then we talk about the plan. But when you actually move from the idea of a plan to a specific plan, it seems to me that those even out. And then Netanyahu, who is the longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history, a very shrewd and skillful political actor, I think Netanyahu is dealing with this politically. I think trying to pressure him diplomatically without addressing the political context and his ability to feed on his domestic political context, I think, is going to be an exercise in frustration.
To an extent, this is what Yahya Sinwar and Hamas wanted to do, right? They wanted to divide Israel not only from Arab countries that were increasingly willing to engage with Israel; they want to divide Israel from the Global South, where Israel had been making increasing leaps, including with China and other countries; they are delighted to divide Israel from Europe; they’re delighted to have support for Israel become much more of a political issue in the United States – and by the way, I think the Russians were also delighted by this.
So it seems to me that what might be the obvious thing of, well, we give Israel billions of dollars a year, we’ll just turn the screws and they’ll do what we want, I’m not sure in this circumstance that gets you where you want to go. And I’m not sure, if you’re not going to address the issues of a democratic public in a state that’s a partner and ally, I’m not sure you can be very effective working through closed diplomatic channels. Certainly, after World Central Kitchen we got some very important things done. But I think there are real limits to what you can do as long as Israeli public opinion is where it is.
Dr. Morrison: Jon – and maybe David can comment on this as well – what’s the consequence of Benny Gantz coming forward and saying we’re laying down an ultimatum of three weeks out, early June, wants to see a plan, and Defense Minister Gallant voicing his objections to the – to the Netanyahu unwillingness to talk about the day after?
Amb. Satterfield: You want to start, Jon?
Dr. Morrison: What does that mean? And now you have the ICC request for warrants.
Dr. Alterman: Yeah. So when I first met David decades ago, he was the deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for Israel. He understands Israeli politics – (laughs) – better than I ever will.
My sense is that Gantz made a fundamental mistake because he didn’t create an alliance behind his ultimatum. And he doesn’t bring down the government by leaving; he isolates himself. Netanyahu has continually bested Gantz politically. And while I understand the polling suggests that Gantz is above Netanyahu as the next prime minister, Netanyahu is rising and Gantz is falling. I wouldn’t put my money on Benny Gantz’s ultimatum changing anything. There are no circumstances – none – under which I can imagine Netanyahu will meet Gantz’s ultimatum.
Gallant is an interesting issue. But again, if your plan is a plan, that’s lovely; but to actually introduce a plan and to stress test it and to get people onboard and implement it, that’s a different task. I hope Israel goes that direction. I think it’s necessary for Israel to go in that direction. But does that change Israeli politics? I don’t know. It seems to me that the issue that I’ve been hearing from people in the U.S. government is the hostage families feel they’re getting more from the U.S. government than they’re getting from the Israeli government. And if your theory of the case is the way this ends is you get the hostages back and you get a ceasefire, that the folks who are working to make that happen are on the side of the angels and the folks who are blocking it are the problem, and the perception of a growing number of Israelis – still not a majority, but a growing number of Israelis – is Netanyahu is becoming part of the problem not part of the solution, I don’t know how that plays out over the next several months, but it seems to me that’s the issue. That’s where some of the ICC things come in as well.
Dr. Morrison: David?
Amb. Satterfield: Let’s talk again about where this all goes, the tell me how this ends. And I have to remind folks here this didn’t start because of an Israeli calculation to malevolently attack Palestinians in Gaza; there was a massacre of historic post-Holocaust proportions. Jews were killed, brutally, bestially, in Israel as a calculated act of terror intended – it mercifully failed because of Sinwar’s miscalculation from the tunnels – to elicit a full-blown Iranian, Hezbollah, and Arab street uprising attack on Israel. Let’s not ever lose sight of how this began.
There is no justification for such a massacre. Can’t be, A. B, any state in this world with the capacity to respond would have had, as the president said on October 18th and 19th, an obligation, not just a right, to take every possible action to prevent it from happening, as Yahya Sinwar and his officials have said, again and again and again.
So let’s not ever lose sight of what the not just initial problem was – the October 7th massacre – but what the challenge is. This is a brutal terrorist force which cheerfully will sacrifice Palestinian civilians.
Now, we counseled Israel strongly privately and publicly for a very long period of time – no secret here; Jake, Secretary Blinken, the president has made reference to this – against a Rafah operation of the character that – we thought full-blown ground maneuver campaign would do two things. It would produce a far more significant movement/displacement of persons out of Rafah than Israel calculated on. When they speak of precise operations, our experience with Khan Younis in particular but also with the north Gaza operations is doesn’t come out that way. And indeed, what was to have been a precise operation for maybe a hundred (thousand), 110,000 in eastern Rafah has now moved to estimates of 800,000-plus, not because they had been ordered to evacuate by Israel but because they’re voting with their feet.
Dr. Morrison: They’re panicked. Yeah.
Amb. Satterfield: They’re moving out of harm’s way. Getting out of Dodge.
So the first concern was the displacement and how you met humanitarian needs of those displaced. We did not see a credible plan. We had a serious plan presented to us, but we didn’t believe the timelines or the substantive assumptions in the plan would work. That was the first concern.
The second concern was the kinetic operation in and of itself would interfere with the ability to move humanitarian assistance through Khan Younis – I’m sorry, through Kerem Shalom and through Rafah and, indeed, that has been, sadly, validated in spades.
It is very hard physically to move assistance in through Kerem Shalom. The Egyptian decision to use denial of movement of any humanitarian assistance or fuel from Egypt, the massive quantity of aid stacked up in north Sinai, to withhold that as a deliberate pressure tactic to bring about a halt to the operation and a reopening of Rafah that was another dimension which, very frankly, took us all and the international community by surprise and we have urged Egypt to move forward with Israel in restoring the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza.
It’s there. It would be complex to move it because of the kinetic actions inside Gaza. But taking that out of the picture and trying to supplant it with commercial assistance coming out of Israel, coming out of the West Bank, it doesn’t work. You need the humanitarian actors on the ground there.
But I want to go to what Jon said about consequences. When Benny Gantz, when Yoav Gallant, speak to the need for a plan they are speaking to – and I’ll put the politics aside – they’re speaking to exactly what we are right now.
There must be a cogent security/political resolution plan for all of this that is strategic in its dimension. It has a regional character to it, and it’s not just the Saudi normalization deal – that’s part of it but not all of it – and it must include a vision, a pathway, to a two-state resolution.
That’s very distant, Jon. I know that. I’ve seen the polls. I’ve talked with Israelis from across the spectrum. It’s really hard to contemplate.
But if you don’t hold that horizon out there then you will never compete with Hamas’ very well established, Nick, as you said, integrated into Gazan life. You’re never going to be able to counter that.
You’ve got to have that as part and parcel of all of this. If you take that away, if you have no ability or only limited ability from a military standpoint to eliminate or even significantly degrade Hamas, you’re left in a very difficult situation. And the “you” here is not just Israel; it’s us, it’s Palestinian Authority, Palestinians, and it is the entire region.
And I’ll make one anecdotal point here. What’s the greatest fear on the part of every regional government, really? It is that in the face of the images coming out every day of Gaza, and their impact on their street, the rising popularity everywhere – but in Gaza, where it’s dropped – of Hamas, that Israel will not be able to do the job. They, at the end of all of this, will not be able to diminish and degrade Hamas. That’s the single greatest fear. And Sinwar – my own view is, yeah, Sinwar is perfectly happy, if it comes to that, to be a martyr because his legacy, leader if the resistance throughout the region, will go on.
I don’t think he thinks that’s what’s going to happen, any more than Vladimir Putin thinks he’s going to lose in Ukraine. They will wait it out. They are, as Hafez al-Assad used to say, “tawil min altanafus,” long of breath. We’re strategically impatient – for political, for other reasons – “we,” the world. They are endlessly patient. They will wait it out. And they will be the victors in all of this. That would be a terrible outcome, terrible strategically for all of us.
Dr. Morrison: I want to bring the conversation back to the sort of reality that we’ve got a million people displaced into absolutely inhumane conditions. We have a humanitarian community to that saying it has become so dangerous during this – during this current military operation that it’s very, very difficult to operate. We have gates closed. We have no deconfliction mechanisms in place. We have, you know, the – none that – I mean, there’s the experiment on the JLOTS pier, DOD pier, which has brought in, you know, a very modest number of relief.
We’re back to where we – you know, back into a pretty nightmarish scenario that is going to carry forward. And it’s going to be of – make for a very ugly summer in our own domestic politics here. We own this in the minds of many people who are critical of the administration. We’re seen as part of this. And the NSM-20 analysis drew conclusions that assistance should not be disrupted to Israel, but it documented – in the analytic side – documented very clearly the degree to which the Israeli government was blocking humanitarian access. And the ICC request is focused on that as well.
Nick, where – how do we – how do we reset our thinking? And we’re not going to have a strategic resolution, as David has – and Jon have emphasized. We need that as the ultimate solution. But if that’s elusive – which by all signs it looks pretty elusive – we have to deal with this current reality that’s staring at us.
Mr. Schifrin: Well, yeah. And I defer to the humanitarian expert on some of those details, so I’ll turn to her. The only thing I’ll say, as Jon was about to say, the deconfliction aspect actually has gotten a little bit better. And what Ambassador Satterfield was mentioning is that the trends were going up –
Dr. Morrison: In April.
Mr. Schifrin: Ironically, because of the World Central Kitchen horrific, horrific incident – which was not only horrific because it took seven lives, it was the nature of how the Israeli military, accidentally, essentially hunted foreign aid workers. And that’s the word that Jose Andres, the head of World Central Kitchen, used. And if you just follow what the drones did, you know, that’s what the conclusion that World Central Kitchen made.
So but I want to – I’ll turn to Michelle on the details. So just want to point that out, the deconfliction – they’re trying. But, again, it took them six months. It took them the World Central Kitchen incident to have a deconfliction cell in the south. And it took extraordinary U.S. pressure, mostly from this man and others, to do those things. And I’ll just say again, anecdotally, 2014, we saw a lot of these problems back then, right? But the Israelis had a different approach tactically. They actually brought the NGOs in every morning and had extraordinarily detailed maps. And the NGOs knew exactly where the strikes would be that day. And there was a lot of communication.
That just hasn’t happened in this war. And I won’t put an opinion out there, but the people I talk to suggest that that’s a product of exactly what we’ve been talking about, the nature of the shock and horror and anger from the Israelis. They fought this war differently than previous wars that they fought in Gaza. But I’ll let you go into the details.
Dr. Morrison: I mean, Nick, in preparation for today I spoke with – in the last couple of days with a number of people, including senior U.S. officials who are involved operationally in trying to work things, and as well as international NGOs and U.N. officials. And that’s where my remarks are coming from in terms of the sharp escalation of insecurity for humanitarians, and the absence of effective deconfliction –
Mr. Schifrin: Yeah, look, I don’t –
Dr. Morrison: – in this setting. And yes, there are – people acknowledged there were modest gains in April after the president’s statement and after the killing on April 4th.
Amb. Satterfield: I’ve got to interrupt. They weren’t modest; they were dramatic. They were enormously significant. The amount of assistance moving in through two new land corridors opened – Zikim and Erez – so, what, Erez West and East – through Gate 96, the central corridor crossing point, through upgrades and expansions of the operations of both Nitsana and Kerem Shalom, the ability to open Ashdod to direct delivery of non-flour-related humanitarian assistance – these weren’t modest little steps, and for seven months, I worked with the international humanitarian operators on the ground – as well as in Geneva, as well as in New York – but on the ground we talked and met continuously, as we did with our Israeli counterparts.
We agree on the progress, but slow progress, that marked October to March, but what we had in place collectively in that first week of May was exceptional. It was no longer a question of famine or starvation, but how could you get specialized feeding in to deal – not just truckloads; we weren’t looking at the metric of truck numbers anymore. And the we, as a collective we – it’s not just the U.S. It is the actual operators on the ground from the humanitarian community. We were looking at how do we get the issue of mortality, morbidity, wasting – which is a strategic challenge – and malnutrition addressed.
We were in a far better place – still not good enough by any means – but a far better place, so I absolutely reject these modest, insignificant gains. They were enormous, the JLOTS offered the potential to augment what was already happening with at least a transitional, temporary, additional infusion of assistance that could go north or south as required. That was interrupted and interrupted catastrophically by the Rafah operation, about which I don’t think any of us have any doubts.
Mr. Schifrin: And consider – (laughs) – that narrative being presented to Israeli officials day after day after day, and yet Rafah still happened. We can talk about why and what, but just think about that. Anyway, I defer to the expert on the specifics.
Dr. Morrison: Michelle?
Ms. Strucke: No, I agree. I mean, in this broadcast we’ve talked about those asks before they happened, about, you know, echoing the need to open those specific crossings, and agree that the gains were dramatic.
At the same time, comparing it to the total siege that happened at the very beginning of the crisis for two weeks where no aid got in, and even comparing to just the immense delays, blockages, turning trucks around based on items that were called dual-use that were, you know, essentially everyday humanitarian items – all of this, I think the comparison is worth seeing, that it was – it is – it wasn’t enough at its best point, and it was at such a low bar that it literally caused a man-made famine.
So I think that while the gains should rightfully be recognized, it still is on a scale that was way too low to begin with and continues to be catastrophically low, which is – again – why people are starving. And, you know, in order to send those highly nutritious, therapeutic foods and then target them, you do need a sophisticated apparatus of distribution, which is very difficult under the circumstances we mentioned.
One thing I wanted to comment on is this, you know, very important point that Ambassador Satterfield has made and we’ve talked about, about specifically the kind of – the fact that there is strong justification for Israel conducting this war. All of this is essential. It’s obviously guiding the emotions, it’s guiding the decisions that are being made.
But under the Geneva Conventions, which just reached their 75th anniversary – we’ve just been celebrating that with the ICRC and others, and the Swiss Embassy and others the past few weeks. The whole beauty of the Geneva Conventions, which every country – 196 countries have voluntarily ratified. No one forced them to ratify the Geneva Conventions.
It doesn’t matter whether the cause is just. What it – what it regulates is that every party, no matter how horrendous your adversary is, no matter how hard operationally a conflict is on the ground – and as you mentioned, this conflict is unprecedented in its characteristics; and as the U.S. military and others and other governments are looking forward to future conflict, they may also be unprecedented in how bad they will be – that does not excuse in a single day a country saying that they can therefore do anything they want, and that war is unbound, and that the rules of war don’t apply.
So that’s why, for me, I think it’s, again, very significant to not get distracted by very good, moral justifications, valid emotions based on how terrible this is – it’s significant to me that the United States in its initial response to the Israeli government, you know, noted and reflected on the past 20 years of war, and that moment of 9/11 and how it caused essentially this, essentially, military reaction which could have been viewed as disproportionate. In this case, I think it’s really important to center the fact that the Geneva Conventions – not obstructing aid, allowing aid to go in not during certain points during the day on certain roads at certain hours, but all the time – unfettered safe humanitarian access is a requirement of the Geneva Conventions; and that, you know, the specifics of, you know, arguing over, again, the kind of what I’ve described as like a Swiss-cheese approach to international law of cherry-picking provisions; is not acceptable because the cost is – as we’ve talked about on this broadcast, the cost is human lives.
Dr. Morrison: David, what leverage do we have now to deal with this burgeoning crisis growing out of the Rafah operations? And what should we – what should we be prioritizing right now? Because it’s a – it’s a pretty awful situation that we face. I mean, there’s no dispute as to the magnitude of what’s happening right now. I mean, we can debate as to how we characterize the period of gains in April, and I take your point about, you know, acknowledging the – Ashdod coming online and the 96 – the Gate 96 and the other steps, but it’s – things are – things have seized up.
Amb. Satterfield: Indeed they have.
Dr. Morrison: And we have a million people that are in complete peril and a much bigger number than that that have been under extraordinary stress. And we’re going to see excess mortality. We’re going to see extreme malnutrition. We’re going to see all sorts of things happen. And as Nick pointed out, it’s going to be on our screens day in, day out in the middle of our own political season, and the emotions are very high. We’ve had campuses disrupted. We’ve had – you know, we’ve got a convention in Chicago coming up. We’ve got a convention in Milwaukee coming up. There’s – it’s going to be a tough summer. And what – you’ve thought deeply about all of this. What’s our leverage? And what should we be – how should we be proactively stepping in to say we’re not just going to wait for this Rafah operation to be concluded before we can revisit any of these – we don’t have the leisure of that, we own this problem in the minds of many people who are criticizing the administration, there needs to be a proactive strategy right now? What’s your – what’s your thoughts?
Amb. Satterfield: Well, our strategy is to focus on two things.
The first, and always, is the humanitarian dimension here, because the humanitarian dimension shapes both reality and perception in Israel, around the world on what is going on, and here in the United States. We know that. And it is the right thing to do. All other factors aside, it is the correct moral thing to do, value-associated thing to do. We are doing all we can with the humanitarian community, with the Israelis. We’ve worked continuously. It is very hard. It is harder, in fact, right now in this situation post-May 6/7 in Rafah than it was for most of the five months that preceded it, where the trendlines were continuously upward. Not enough – Michelle’s right, not enough – but they were upward. Now it’s all being reversed or has been reversed. So our focus is on humanitarian.
But it is also – and listen to what not just our colleagues in Israel – Gallant, Benny Gantz – are saying, but what we are saying at the highest levels of the U.S. government, the president articulating there has got to be a strategic plan for how this ends. Do Rafah, don’t do Rafah; we have other views on how Rafah could have been done, could still be done, apart from a major ground maneuver campaign into central Gaza, which has not yet taken place.
Dr. Morrison: Central Rafah, yeah.
Amb. Satterfield: Into central Rafah, right. We have our views on that, which we made clear. But there’s got to be an overarching political strategic vision as well here. A lot is at stake for Israel, its security, its future in the region, in the world. Witness the decision by the three European states to recognize a, quote, “Palestinian state,” close quote. All of this has to be addressed through political steps, not just through military steps. So we don’t see that happening. We have been as clear as can be about what is needed here. And it is the pathway to a two-state resolution. It is bringing down this ground campaign, restoring humanitarian access, restoring the ability to address the needs of Palestinians, stabilizing the situation.
I say that all. It’s easy for me to articulate. It is in the face of a Hamas which will, and is, capitalizing upon every moment that goes by. And to believe Hamas in the least cares about any international humanitarian principle is absurd on its face. They’re going to be a challenge – a challenge to the region, a challenge to Israel. And if you can’t address that, if you can’t show to an Israeli, displaced from the north, displaced from the Gaza corridor, or not displaced but who knows a hostage family, who knows someone killed in the massacres on October 7th – and almost every Israeli does – then you’ve got a traumatized nation which is not going to be able or willing to make the kinds of broad, long-term strategic decisions we think are necessary, or which we have a great ability – you’ve been quite accurate in your comments, Jon – to decisively shape.
We cannot turn on and off policymaking in a democracy. That is very hard to do. We have suspended the delivery of the two iron bomb systems, 2,000-pound, 500-pound, because we thought those systems in a Rafah urban campaign were unnecessary, and moreover inappropriate for use, based on the history of their application. But we continue to robustly supply, as we should and must, Israel’s needs in terms of prosecuting a cogent strategic campaign against this terrorist force.
Mr. Schifrin: I think it’d be – oh, sorry, Jon.
Dr. Alterman: No, I totally agree with David. I think that the very difficult reality is two-thirds of Israelis don’t believe in a two-state solution right now. I don’t know how many Palestinians do. If we’re not addressing that issue – not just say and of course you should, because they don’t. And I think a large part of our diplomatic engagement has to be working with states around the world, with regional states, with others to try to make that pathway look like one that actually increases security for both sides, rather than one that undermines security for both sides.
And this is one of the reasons why, you know, I’m concerned by the ICC decision, because it doesn’t seem calculated to get hostages home faster. It doesn’t seem calculated to end the fighting faster. It doesn’t seem calculated to do anything especially constructive, if your goal is to build the confidence of Israelis and Palestinians alike that there’s a future where there is security for both sides. And I think we have to – that, again, you’re dealing with a democratic public. And all the leverage in the world is not going to get a democratic public to flip to meet your security demands.
Mr. Schifrin: I think Karim Khan, if he were here, would say, that’s all well and good but that’s not my job. That’s the politics. And I’m about justice. And he sees in this moment his responsibility.
But leaving that aside, I think it’s important to lay out some of the oubriete (ph) – what would be next, smart guy – options, because – and I think the point that I want to get to is, the theory of the case, as Ambassador Satterfield, the national security adviser, the secretary of state, and even the president has laid out, there’s a big gap. And this is the point that I want to get to. There’s a gap between the theory of the case and the –
Dr. Morrison: What’s possible.
Mr. Schifrin: What’s possible, realistic, or likely. And so if we take on the one side the Israeli plans, right? So occupation is what Defense Minister Yoav Gallant essentially accused Netanyahu of defaulting into. For lack of a cogent plan you end with occupation. So let’s just put occupation as one option; that’s easy. Netanyahu’s plan – so let’s give him credit for one second and say he has a plan – has essentially been to find Gazans – essentially we call them Gazan families – or find influential Gazans who are neither Fatah, who are neither Palestinian Authority nor Hamas, to be able to take over security and governance while the military does what it does. Most experts – I defer to the experts – think that it’s unrealistic, and that’s charitable. Even Netanyahu himself has said Hamas has not allowed that to happen. OK, so those are options number one and two.
Three: The shining beacon on the hill, the U.S. plan, that is not only the end of the war but is like a Sadat moment of Mohammed bin Salman, the prince – the princeling of Saudi Arabia coming to Jerusalem, you know, saying I’ve got this plan, Bibi jettisoning probably his coalition in order to make the deal. I mean, wow, right? Like, giant plan on the hill.
So we’ve got occupation, which everybody says nobody wants; Bibi’s plan, which apparently isn’t possible; and this shining this on the hill, which, my god, of course everyone would love but the possibility of it happening under this prime minister and this government, very low. I’m not saying it’s no, but it’s very low – which leaves what? I’m reminded of, like, the Afghanistan debate where the military boxed Obama in, right? It was like, sir, you could have really hot or really cold. But this is kind of Goldilocks. The problem is, what’s Goldilocks in this case? The Hamas plan, right? So it’s not occupation, it’s not the shining city on the hill, it’s not the Bibi plan; it’s what Hamas has offered, which ironically is what a lot of the Israelis who are on the streets in Tel Aviv are demanding: the return of the hostages. Only problem is that Hamas survives. The war ends, Hamas gets a deal to somehow survive, even if it involves some kind of exile of its leadership, gets reconstruction money, and we go back to the status quo, which, of course, nobody wants. After so much death, after everything we’ve talked about, and yet, and yet the concern is, is that becoming almost a Goldilocks option? And that’s the problem between the huge gap between the theory of the case that you guys are presenting – hey, Yogi Berra, there’s two options here; instead of taking an option you take the fork, right? And ironically what is, unfortunately, again, you know, to most people emerging as this middle thing? Well, maybe that’s the Hamas plan –
Amb. Satterfield: But Nick, there’s a problem here with the Goldilocks solution and it’s the UAE, the Saudis –
Mr. Schifrin: Oh, that’s a good point.
Amb. Satterfield: – and the Egyptians –
Mr. Schifrin: Yeah, they don’t want to do it.
Amb. Satterfield: – who frankly are not going to put a boot, a shoe, a buck into Gaza if it is only in order to revalidate – passively, behind the curtains, or quite actively – a Hamas governance of Gaza. They’re not going to do it. They also demand elimination – let’s get rid of that word – but a sufficient disruption, derogation, diminution of Hamas’s power that, with a political vision, with some kind of stabilization, you come out with a different outcome that doesn’t have Hamas in a dominant position. If that’s a solution, then you’re going to get participation in it. That is very difficult to envision at this moment because of the extraordinary resilience of Hamas in the face of all of this.
Mr. Schifrin: Militarily, as I discussed at the beginning, right? I mean, half the tunnels, half the soldiers, after so much time – maybe it’s a little bit higher but give or take, right, and I guess the official number’s classified, but, like, you’ve got a long way to go if you are trying to defeat Hamas. And the problem, then, Ambassador, is OK, well, is there a fifth option? Is there something else, or do we just need to start – just need to keep on pressuring the Israelis to think of that shining city on the hill –
Amb. Satterfield: Well, there is another option but it’s not a satisfactory one from the standpoint of the United States, our partners or, we think, the region, which is this all just goes on, the humanitarian crisis, the military campaign, the repeat – rinse and repeat, no clear, no hold –
Mr. Schifrin: Mowing the grass, as the Israelis –
Amb. Satterfield: But it isn’t even that. It’s Dave’s – Dave Petraeus’s doctrine. You’re not clearing – not really – you’re sure not holding, and you can’t build under these circumstances.
Mr. Schifrin: And ironically, that would allow Benjamin Netanyahu to stay in power, but –
Dr. Morrison: And that is the likely possibility. We’re getting towards the end of our hour. I want to ask, I’ll start with Michelle, how bad are things going to get on the humanitarian side in the next month?
Ms. Strucke: I mean, I think that –
Dr. Morrison: They’re terrible now. How bad are they going to get?
Ms. Strucke: When you look at the issues with a potential Rafah escalation on the ground, border crossings remaining closed, you know, you could – we could see more humanitarian groups saying that they have to suspend operations. That would be significant. We could see much more escalation regarding the pier, in terms of as people feel more desperate they could, again, continue to go to those trucks and try to take the food for their families, and acts of desperation. And, of course, the reverberating effects, third-order effects, issues with not just the famine, starvation, malnutrition, infectious disease, but that on the population, I think we could see this get catastrophically worse.
That being said, no matter how long this conflict goes on – and we measure that every hour as humanitarians in the cost of human lives that are lost and futures that are – that are – you know, that are disappeared – the issue that no matter what the parties are doing and no matter what the other side is doing, they should make much more efforts to have a trust-based deconfliction system so aid workers can get aid in, and follow international law – international humanitarian law to allow that assistance to get in.
And fundamentally, you know, not shy away from facing the facts of impartial experts that are delivering that aid. So I think it’s just – it’s really important, again, to not get distracted by, you know, justifications, but to think about the fact that this is not a scenario where all – everything’s on the table, you can conduct yourself in any way in war. This is a scenario where humanitarian aid has to be, you know, tripled, quadrupled, and not completely closed off, as it is now.
Dr. Morrison: David, how bad is it going to get, do you think, in the next month?
Amb. Satterfield: If the current trend lines aren’t changed, then what is right now a near 100 percent risk of famine could see realization of famine and starvation, which would reverse six months of progressive progress in addressing basic needs, avoiding starvation, avoiding famine, and certainly make it very difficult to address the specialized feeding needs we have. Yes, it could get much more serious than it is now if there is no amelioration to these trend lines.
But they are all tied to the character of the operations in Rafah and their impact upon physical access, both from Israel – which is to say, how you get stuff from just inside Gaza, at Erez, at Kerem Shalom, into Gaza proper for distribution. And the problem of Egypt’s refusal to allow any assistance, any fuel, to move from Egyptian territory, as a political tactic. Let’s not forget what is happening here. Thousands of trucks of assistance, millions of liters of fuel, aren’t going in because Egypt refused to allow it to happen as a bargaining tool to get an end to the Rafah campaign and a reopening of Rafah as it was.
Dr. Morrison: Thank you. Nick, how bad is it going to get in terms of media visibility, in your view?
Mr. Schifrin: Well, I think, as the experts have just laid out, as we see more of that happening, and presumably the Israeli operation in Rafah, if we believe the defense minister and the prime minister, will continue and will increase, presumably we will see that. It’s what – it’s what you’ve pointed out, Steve, that you’re going to get the same level of horror on nightly newscasts around the world. But then the convention arrives, but then the election increases. And we don’t know what impact that’s going to have.
I mean, I think we see the trend lines, right? Like, for example, Arab Americans in Michigan. But we don’t know what the impact that’s going to be. But it’s going to have an impact. And if this war goes on, we’re going to be talking about a war in Gaza that is looking awful. We’re going to be talking about war in Ukraine, where Ukraine will barely be hanging on. And we know what former President Donald Trump will say is that President Biden is involved in two conflicts and hasn’t solved either one. And so you’re going to see that argument play out probably more publicly than before.
Dr. Morrison: Jon, your thoughts? I mean, what’s the next month going to look like, in your view?
Dr. Alterman: I worry the next month is really bad. I also worry that both antagonists in this war think time is on their side that they’re going to hang in there, that the stakes are so large the sacrifices are worth it.
We have – as I think David suggested, we have a timeline that’s fairly rapid. We have political urgency. We have a potential change in administrations. I think for both Palestinians in Gaza and for Israelis they see this as something that will affect generations already. This war has affected generations not just politically but in terms of stunting, malnutrition. The human costs on Gazans are going to be felt for generations.
But I worry that we have a policy process that, you know, our long – our very long term is two years. It’s the very long term, impossibly long term. It’s, like, for people who are fighting this war, prosecuting this war right now, they say this absolutely will sharply affect the future of my children and my grandchildren, and we have to dig in. And I worry that we are much further from the end than anybody on this panel in a million years would ever want.
Dr. Morrison: Thank you.
Ambassador Satterfield – David – thank you so much for your service to our country and the work that you’ve done, and thank you for being with us today and being so candid and open to all of these tough issues.
Nick, thank you for taking time out to come over with us again –
Mr. Schifrin: Thank you for having me.
Dr. Morrison: – and for all your great work. And my colleagues Jon and Michelle thank you for partnering in this and we’ll be back again soon I hope. This show will be the video from it and a transcript will be posted on the CSIS homepage so those of you who wish to access it can find it there.
Thank you.

44,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/nato-and-its-south-redefining-terms,"Mathieu Droin, Carlota G. Encina, Cameron Hudson, and Selin Uysal","May 17, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"On May 7, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) released a report that lays out the findings of a “comprehensive and deep reflection process on the southern neighbourhood” carried out by a group of independent experts. This process derives from a tasking at the 2023 Vilnius summit pushed mainly by nations from NATO’s southern flank. This report comes against the backdrop of Russia’s aggression toward Ukraine, which has refocused NATO on its core mandate—collective defense and deterrence—and on its eastern flank. This refocusing follows three decades of post–Cold War soul-searching, which led to a constant expansion of the alliance’s missions, with an increasing emphasis on “crisis management” and a multiplication of out-of-area operations, with arguably mixed results and legacies. As a result, there is considerable friction, both among NATO members and between NATO and countries in its South, about the desired level of engagement in and with the southern neighborhood. The report shows a genuine and serious effort to factor in the many parameters and stakes, informed by exchanges with allies; NATO staff; and representatives, institutions, and civil society based in its southern partner states. Its recommendations are meant to guide discussions on the issue ahead of and during the July 2024 Washington summit.
Q1: What is the track record and perception of NATO in African and Middle Eastern regions?
A1: Over the years, NATO has increased institutional engagement in and with countries from what it calls its “South,” a vast area spanning from West Africa to Central Asia. This engagement has taken the form of institutional partnerships via the Mediterranean Dialogue launched in 1994 and the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative, which included four Gulf countries and was launched in 2004. NATO also established a southern hub within the Allied Joint Force Command Naples in 2017.
Nevertheless, NATO’s history with its South and perception in the region remains largely marked by its military interventions in Afghanistan (2003–2021) and in Libya (2011). Both failed to bring stability, if not witnessing a deterioration of the local and regional security environment. The report is clear-eyed when it states that:
""The perception of NATO and Allies in the southern neighbourhoods is somewhat negative. For many in the region, NATO is perceived as adopting double standards in responding to crises and conflicts on the world stage and is perceived as using its military assets to project power and interests from the ‘so-called’ “Global North” without fully taking into account the needs and concerns of the South.""
This perception is unevenly shared in the region, with some specific countries having developed close partnerships with the alliance, such as Jordan (one of the four Enhanced Opportunities Partners), Mauritania, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates. But it might conversely be an understatement in some areas, such as in the Sahelian states, where a dominant narrative is that the 2011 NATO-led campaign in Libya is the original cause of the region’s current instability. The subsequent collapse of the Libyan state that resulted from what Africans see as NATO’s aggressive action, despite the organization framing itself as a defensive alliance, led to a mass exodus of foreign fighters from Qaddafi’s army, with the fighters fanning out across the Sahel and carrying with them stockpiles of Libyan weapons. This dramatic event is seen locally as the starter’s pistol to more than a decade of violence, instability, and military coups that have plagued the region (which the United Nations today refers to as “the global epicentre of terrorism”) ever since. NATO’s hasty retreat from Libya in the aftermath of state collapse is not unrelated to the country’s current predicament, and it has more widely created both an impression of unreliability and of an organization interested in its security even at the expense of others. 
Complicating the African view of NATO even further is the organization’s language that “the Russian Federation is the most significant and direct threat to Allies’ security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area.” In the past two years, at least four Sahelian states have invited Russian military trainers to replace trainers from NATO member states as those countries’ security partner of choice. At a moment when Sahelian states are aligning more closely with Russia under the guise of asserting sovereign rights over their own security, governance, and economic futures, this has in many ways meant a broad rejection of the seemingly “neo-colonial” policies of traditional partners, amplified by misinformation and disinformation. 
In the Middle East, the alliance’s actual footprint has been limited. But Washington’s “war on terror” and the “forever wars” of Iraq and Afghanistan have taken a toll, by association, on NATO’s image in the region. At the same time, demonstrating its adaptability after an initial withdrawal in 2011, NATO redeployed to Iraq in 2018 amid the fight against the Islamic State, complementing the efforts of the coalition to defeat the Islamic State and providing strategic advice to the Iraqi ministries of defense and the interior. In addition, NATO has conducted several maritime security operations, such as Operation Ocean Shield in the Gulf of Aden from 2009 to 2015 and Operation Sea Guardian in the Mediterranean, which has been active since 2016. Simultaneously, for countries that have tied their security to U.S. security guarantees, such as Jordan and the Gulf countries, NATO remains a reference model, the yardstick against which to compare their own defense relationship with the United States—which they have been striving to upgrade. 
Q2: Why was a report on NATO’s southern flank published?
A2: This report stems from a shared concern by some southern NATO countries that the renewed focus on the eastern flank could result in less attention to the threats emanating from the southern flank, including terrorism, the weaponization of energy resources, and irregular immigration. Notably, Spain, the host country of the 2022 Madrid summit, was instrumental in ensuring that the significance of these challenges and threats was reflected in NATO’s new strategic concept and was consistent with NATO’s broader 360-degree approach.
Southern European countries have since maintained pressure on NATO’s international staff to have clearer deliverables or actionable plans to ensure the alliance’s enduring interest in its “southern neighbourhoods.” This eventually led the North Atlantic Council to commission an independent group of experts to formulate a set of political guidelines, centered around NATO's objectives and potential roles in these neighborhoods, at the 2023 Vilnius summit. A group of 11 independent experts was appointed on October 6, 2023. The report’s recommendations should be discussed ahead of the July 2024 Washington summit, during which some decisions should be made on the matter.
Q3: What are the key takeaways from the report?
A3: The experts paint a grim picture of the security environment in this broad area. They assess that the challenges of the southern flank are increasingly interconnected with those of the east, by way of Russia, and that the security of allies is closely intertwined with that of the Middle East, North Africa, the Sahel, and the Gulf of Guinea region. A novel aspect of the report is its focus not only on threats and risks but also on opportunities (a term that appears 16 times).
The report suggests a change in semantics when referring to the region, and it coins the term “southern neighborhoods,” with a final “s,” to better reflect the diversity of the subregions, each with unique political landscapes requiring tailored approaches. A crucial emphasis is placed on the need to listen, engage, and better understand the southern neighborhoods. The report insists that this must be a two-way process involving political dialogue, credibility, trust, and coherence. The southern neighborhoods must also gain a deeper understanding of NATO, given the existing negative perceptions of the organization. According to the report, NATO needs to undertake internal efforts to simplify processes and enhance transparency, thereby improving its image among neighboring regions.
The report tackles the vast region through two angles. First, the report employs a geographic lens, offering recommendations for short-, medium-, and long-term actions in the three “regions of strategic interest”: North Africa, the Middle East, and the Sahel and Sub-Saharan Africa. Second, it examines thematic areas of cooperation such as human security; women, peace, and security; counterterrorism; maritime security; climate change; public diplomacy and strategic communications; and foreign information manipulation and interference (FIMI).
The key recommendations of the report can be broken down into three categories.
The first category includes some institutional measures, such as the appointment of a special envoy for the southern neighborhood, the convening of a special summit meeting with all of NATO’s southern partners, or the establishment of NATO political representation within the African Union. It is also noteworthy that, in the context of the war in Gaza, the paper proposes that NATO invites the Palestinian Authority to observe or participate in NATO’s ongoing Mediterranean Dialogue activities, in accordance with existing practices.
Second, the report makes recommendations related to concrete cooperation, notably in terms of training and capacity building, building on the experience of NM-I, which could be replicated to the benefit of other partners. The report also emphasizes the potential for maritime security cooperation and cooperation on resilience, including via the establishment of resilience advisory support teams.
Finally, special attention is given to information and communication, mutual knowledge, and civil society engagement. The report suggests setting up a Counter-FIMI Centre of Excellence and a permanent “Facts for Peace” initiative, as well as promoting youth engagement.
Relatively absent from the report, however, is a thorough analysis of interallied relations and dynamics regarding engagements toward the southern neighborhoods. While the report hints at risks of dispersion and duplications, it glosses over the competition and sometimes tensions among alliance members who have conflicting interests in some theatres, such as Libya, Syria, Iraq, or West Africa.
Q4: How might NATO go about implementing the report’s recommendations?
A4: NATO should be careful; the West’s overreliance on security approaches to advance its own counterterror interests has been, at best, insufficient, and at worst counterproductive. For NATO to rebuild those relations, it first should demonstrate that it is genuinely interested in long-term partnerships that will deliver net benefits to African and Middle Eastern states—what their leaders regularly call “win-win” arrangements. It would do well to take a holistic approach to advancing its objectives: focusing on helping to develop state capacity and civic institutions, in close coordination with the European Union and the United Nations, which remain the best equipped in these fields. 
Special attention should be given to strategic communication. In 2021, NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg’s unconcerted announcement of a troop surge for NM-I, increasing its personnel from 500 up to 4,000, sparked outrage in Iraq. This announcement, which came one year after the adoption of a resolution by the Iraqi Parliament calling for the departure of all foreign troops, was widely exploited by pro-Iranian groups. Heeding the lessons learned, NM-I has embarked on a course correction, emphasizing in its communication a steadfast commitment to Iraqi sovereignty and a close partnership with the Iraqi government, which is currently led by parties aligned with Tehran. The faux pas highlights the importance of tailoring communication strategies to local contexts and political sensitivities, in Iraq and elsewhere.
Some elements of the report show a real effort to move toward a demand-driven, cooperative approach that factors in “local contexts.” It notably underlines the need for “navigating non-exclusivity,” hinting at many partners’ wariness of “being drawn into a geopolitical struggle” and their willingness to maintain cooperation with NATO’s strategic competitors. The report’s emphasis on “inclusivity” and broader engagement with “parliaments, media, civil society and youth,” as well as “scholars and think tankers,” is certainly moving in the right direction. Ultimately, it’s a strong and engaged civil society that is the best antidote to Russian and other competitors’ meddling, terrorist recruitment, and military rule.

J. Stephen Morrison: Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening. I’m J. Stephen Morrison. I’m senior vice president here at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, CSIS, in Washington, D.C. This is a program of the CSIS Bipartisan Alliance for Global Health Security.
We’re delighted today to be able to host Angela Apeagyei and Chris Murray from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, I’ll introduce them momentarily, to welcome their colleagues who are here. We have been in the habit for several years – this is the 15th year of the Financing Global Health Report from IHME. And congratulations to Angela and Chris and the team for this report. This as we’ll hear, this is the 15th year.
We were in the habit, pre-COVID, of hosting the annual rollout of the report. COVID got in the way. And now we’re back in the swing. And so, we’re very happy that we’ve been able to resume this partnership. We typically do this with the Kaiser Family Foundation and Jennifer Kates. Jennifer can’t be with us today, sends her regards. In the future I’m sure we’ll be able to bring Kaiser Family Foundation back to the stage with us.
Special thanks to my colleagues, Maclane Speer, Sophia Hirshfield, Micheala Simoneau, Carolina Andrada. From our production team, special thanks to Theo Michell, Dwayne Gladden, and Qi Yu for all their great work in pulling this whole thing together. And on the side of IHME, we’re very grateful to Rhonda Stewart for helping us pull the pieces together for today’s event. And delighted to see Joe Dieleman back here with us.
Angela Apeagyei is a research assistant professor at IHME in Seattle. She co-leads the Development Assistance for Health Resources Tracking Team, which is a very important team within the IHME ranks, and fundamental to the production of this report. She holds a Ph.D. in global health management and policy from Tulane School of Public Health, has a master’s in international development economics from Yale, and graduated with a degree in economics from Oberlin.
Chris Murray is a professor and chair of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle, and director there at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. He’s a physician and a health economist. He’s pioneered the work of the global burden of disease, injuries, and risks, GBD, which is, as I understand it, approaching, it’s 28th or 29th year. Is that correct?
Christopher Murray: More than 30.
Dr. Morrison: More than 30 years. And has been obviously at the center of the production of the Financing Global Health Reports. And during COVID, we worked very closely with him as he spearheaded new modeling approaches to the COVID – to the COVID intervention?
So, what we’re going to do here today, Angela is going to come forward and present an overview, with some slides, of the – of the report. And then we’re going to gather here and have a conversation for the balance of the hour. And we’ll leave some space towards the end for those in the audience who care to pose some remarks and questions. There’s a microphone right here. Please do join us in that phase, those who are here in person, and just keep your interventions brief, please. Thank you.
So, Angela, please come and join us. Thank you so much for being with us.
Angela Apeagyei: Thank you, Steve. I am delighted to be able to be part of this in-person public lunch for the Financing Global Health Report.
Before I get into the details of the results from our analysis, I would like to acknowledge three important groups of people. Steve and everyone at CSIS who has contributed to the strong partnership with IHME, thank you. It’s indeed an honor to be back here today. To the Gates Foundation, who have funded IHME generously and funded this work, thank you. And, most importantly but certainly not the least, to the team at IHME who are behind this important global public good, including Joe Dieleman and Chris Murray, who have led this work in the past.
This year marks the 15th year of IHME’s publication of the Financing Global Health Report. This is a flagship report at IHME that looks at the global health spending trends and levels, especially in low- and middle-income countries. This year, we focused on the important topic of debt burden and development assistance for health. COVID-19 upended most of our lives as we know it and had a huge economic and social toll. Many countries took out loans in order to shore up their economies. In the next few slides, I will go over what has happened with development assistance for health during and after the pandemic, and what is currently happening, as well as the implications for rising interest rates on development assistance for health as well as government spending on health.
In 2023, a total of $64 billion was contributed towards development assistance for health. And this is financial and non-financial resources transferred to international development agencies to low- and middle-income countries, primarily with the intention of improving or maintaining health. This slide, you see, tells two important stories. One, the evolution of development assistance for health over time. Particularly highlighting the dramatic increase in year on year development assistance for health as a result of the health-related response to the COVID pandemic, as well as the subsequent decline towards pre-pandemic levels in the levels of development assistance for health. Suggesting that the response was similar to the panic and neglect approach that has been used in the past. And so as the emergency phase of the pandemic has ended, resources are now being redirected towards other areas.
Secondly, the figure highlights the different areas of health activities that this funding has supported. Again, related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we see that a lot of the funding in 2020 and 2021 went towards the COVID-related response. We also see that other disease areas, such as HIV/AIDS, may have suffered some reductions around those things. We do note that current data for 2023 suggests that as the pandemic response has died down there’s resurgence in funding for HIV/AIDS and the other areas.
Moving on to the implications of this in relation to the rising interest rates. Up until recent times, the interest rates in most advanced countries had been at historic lows. And this figure highlights how interest payments have increased in relation to levels in 2019. We see from the figure that, in relation to 2019 across all income groups, interest payments have increased, especially for low-income countries. That’s highlighted in the green line. And this pattern has implications for both development assistance for health and government spending for health going forward.
We unpack these pathways in these next two slides. So to start with, what we did to understand the implications of the increased interest payments for government health spending, we examined this through estimating expected increases or growth in government health spending going forward. And the figure highlights the results of that analysis. We can see from the results that, in general, the expected growth in government health spending is rather tepid, especially for low-income countries. We have only about a dollar increase in expected health spending when compared to the per-person spending in 2000. This is all quite concerning.
For understanding development assistance for health and what we can expect there, we looked at two different scenarios. One scenario, looking at the implication if governments or donor countries maintain the levels of support they have in the past. And that’s reported in the black line. And here, we see that if donors continue to maintain that support, we expect that about 50 billion dollars will be raised for development assistance for health in 2030. However, if donors reprioritize other sectors and reallocate resources away from health, we’re at risk of – we see only about $37 billion being allocated to health.
And what does this all mean for the future of global health financing? We see that there are imminent threats to the availability of financial resources for global health. And this is both domestically and internationally. And in order to be able to maintain or secure the gains in global health that have been made, intentional advocacy will be prudent going forward. Thank you. (Applause.)
Dr. Morrison: Thank you, Angela. Thank you and congratulations again. I mean, the picture that you’re painting in this report is quite mixed. I mean, there’s a – there’s a certain realism to it, in terms of the scenarios – you know, the optimistic scenario is still might quite modest, right? Four-point-nine percent growth over the next 11 years. That’s not much. And then the more pessimistic one is one of regression by $11 ½ billion. So, it’s very cautionary, very realistic in that regard. And on the other hand, you’re saying that we went from – 2019 was at 49.3 billion dollars. We jumped to 84 billion dollars. That was a massive expansion. And then, as COVID faded, there was a sharp contraction. But that contraction brought us down to almost 65 billion dollars. So that contraction brought us down to a level today that’s 33 percent higher than what it was in ’19.
So, it says that something stuck, right? That there’s been a jump up, a bump up on the investments. But I also sense that – in the report that you’re suggesting, well, you know, maybe that’s not secure. Maybe climate is going to take a bigger and bigger bite out of resources. Maybe we have other forces – the interest – putting such emphasis on interest, on the debt. That’s novel. It’s surprising, I think, for a lot of us. To put so much emphasis on that was really quite illuminating. So, Chris, tell us your – tell us your reflections on filling in on what we’ve just heard from Angela.
Dr. Murray: You know, I think there could be scope to be somewhat even more pessimistic than what Angela’s showed us in those graphs. Because, you know, we haven’t been reminding people of the extraordinary success around global health investments of the last two or three decades, where there’s just been – you know, if you take the graph of under-five mortality, despite COVID, it’s just kept marching down. Go back to when Niger had an under-five mortality rate of 350. And now there’s essentially almost nowhere on the planet that’s above 100 per thousand live births.
So huge progress. It’s continued even in the poorest parts of the world. Yet, there’s this sense that other problems, particularly when you step outside the U.S., are more important, more urgent – and particularly climate. And now, add to that wars and humanitarian crisis. So, unless we make a very good case on what the world gets from these critical investments, it seems like there’s real risk on the horizon for global health.
Dr. Morrison: We had talked a little earlier about, you know, a pessimistic scenario would be one where you say, you know, the interest in in global health has peaked. We’re in a – we’re in a twilight period. We’re in the period of multiple replenishments coming forward in this year and next, some new ones, some big ones. We’ve already seen the difficulty in getting a five-year reauthorization of PEPFAR. The best that could be accomplished was one. That was a very ominous signal.
So, we may be heading into some rude surprises in terms of the gap between what is – really what the aspirations are across Global Fund, and Gavi, and the new funding mechanisms for WHO, the World Bank IDA replenishment, versus what’s really possible. And we’re in a period of a populist critique of foreign aid, right? And we’re in a period of multiple elections happening in which there’s questions being raised about what’s the value, what’s the end game, how does this fit a national security strategy that has us in, you know, a strategic competition with China and other adversaries?
So, there’s a lot swirling around there. I take your point that the approach – Angela closed with we need – we need a better advocacy. Which begs the question of, OK, what would the elements of that look like? And you’re suggesting one is, come back to reminding all of us of the remarkable gains. I think that’s a very important – that’s a very important point. We’re aware of that, but I don’t think that’s being advertised and introduced. But what are some of the other elements that you think should be put into an updated strategy in order to be more optimistic and leaning forward more positively, and not just being pessimistic here? Because it’s not preordained that we’re going to see that decline, but there’s this distinct possibility of that. Your thoughts, Angela?
Dr. Apeagyei: So, thanks, Steve. I think one way in which we can make sure that the gains that have been made in global health are sustained is strengthening our arguments, including providing more detail that links how important it is for national security. I think coming off of the COVID pandemic response, there’s enough evidence of how important it is to make sure that health systems around the world are robust and can detect some of these emerging pathogens. And so, I would say, get some more data that helps us make that link, in a self-interest kind of way, to the citizens, is an important approach.
Dr. Morrison: Thank you. Chris, your thoughts?
Dr. Murray: You know, I think there’s still an ongoing set of new intervention strategies that are coming from investments in R&D. You know, we obviously saw during the COVID pandemic the rollout of mRNA vaccines. But it’s not the only innovation that’s out there for global health. So, I think part of the argument is we have some new opportunities to make improvements and to do that at an even more attractive, cost-effective framework. So that’s part of it. I do think we should – because I think it’s true – link investments in health to helping the hardest-hit countries in the future from climate change, manage their health problems. Particularly the food security part of it. And so that can be an argument as well for managing those two problems in some sort of joint way.
Dr. Morrison: So, climate’s not necessarily – not strictly a threat to health – to health funding. It’s generating health implications. And we’ll be seeing this in terms of increased migration. We’ll be seeing it in terms of infectious disease, extreme weather impacts, and like. And you’re saying, the mitigation agenda is one where there’s going to need much more attention on what the health impacts are.
Dr. Murray: Careful of language because I think some people hear “mitigation,” they think just about decreasing –
Dr. Morrison: No, I mean –
Dr. Murray: – greenhouse gases. But, you know, from the modeling it seems like the biggest pathway for climate on health is actually the food security pathway. And there’s a lot of role for intervening on malnutrition, both in children and adults, to help avoid that health burden. And so, yes, it could be – if you – if we marshal the evidence, and we figure out how to make that case, it can actually help on the health side.
Dr. Apeagyei: Tying the point Chris just made about food security to an earlier point, that the area with both the remaining highest burdens is around the Sahel and the desert areas. I see the great opportunity there in making that case related to providing more support to resolve the food security issues and helping simultaneously deal with the health limitations in the – in the Sahel and other areas that still have heavy burdens of disease.
Dr. Morrison: Now, we are in a period of very large geopolitical wars, right? We’re in the period of Ukraine. We’re seeing the continued war, Hamas-Israel, the possibility of it widening with the Iranian confrontation. We just saw the passage of the $95 billion package of assistance, that included 8 or 9 billion dollars on humanitarian assistance. So, these wars are long lasting. They’re long lasting. They’re big. They’re generating huge human costs. And the price of addressing those is turning out to be very high.
Now, when Global Fund was launched, when PEPFAR was launched, that was the period of the Iraq War and the period of the Afghanistan War. I mean, we had the – what seemed then to become the forever wars. But we were able to deal with those realities simultaneously. How do you see dealing with the pressures coming out of these big geopolitical wars on budgets, on attention spans, and the like? How do you see – what’s the way to navigate that reality today?
Dr. Murray: Part of it is the numbers, because we think of wars and all the terrible destruction associated with them, but still, there’s far more people who are dying from some of the major global health challenges every day then they are dying from the conflicts. So, you sort of got to make the case, not to ignore the conflicts or the humanitarian imperative, but if you care about saving lives and preventing harm, there is this huge still-unfinished agenda. And so, it’s back to sort of reminding people of the core case that was made more than two decades ago to expand global health. And we made progress. The investments have been successful. But there is this need to keep going and get the job done.
Dr. Morrison: Angela, your thoughts?
Dr. Apeagyei: I think, given what you said about limited resources, limited attention, it might be useful to find areas of synergy and opportunities where we can be a little more efficient with the resource – the limited – very limited resources that are available, in trying to solve both perhaps humanitarian health problems in a humanitarian context, right? In that sense, leveraging the same dollars to try and address issues that are intersectoral.
Dr. Morrison: The climate issue is going to be a tricky one, right? I mean, the – we’re launching some work on climate and health this summer for the next couple of years, and when we look at this, consciousness around the connection between climate and health has risen but we don’t have a clear strategy. There’s scattered initiatives here and there. It’s not clear what – which interventions are going to be the most effective with regard to health. And then we – as a country, we’re very divided about what climate – about climate change. So, you’re sort of pushing – you’ve got the notion of creating a bipartisan consensus around climate and health; it’s going to be a challenge trying to do that because people are understandably a little hesitant to sort of take this on at this point in time. Say a bit about the complexities of climate and climate health.
Dr. Murray: Well, we are spending a lot of time thinking about this because – for two reasons.
First, you know, as part of not the financing work, but part of the global burden of disease work, we forecast out into the future. We’re actually publishing this week our global forecast around the burden of disease from everything out to 2050. And as you go farther out – which the climate community, you know, does out to 2100 – you have to ask: What are all the pathways by which climate change can and is likely to influence health? And so, the direct effects of heat are pretty straightforward to capture – you know, heatwaves and sort of increased risk of NCDs and other diseases. It gets trickier when you get into things like floods, storms, you know, wildfires. But again, there’s climate modelers who tell us about some trajectories for that, and we can figure out the health risks. And they’re important, but they’re not huge.
The big – the big pathway that we – our attention’s drawn to is this pathway through some places becoming unlivable and, therefore, people either stay in those environments – this is in the Sahel, in parts of India, the Middle East, Central America – and end up with greatly elevated rates of child and adult malnutrition, or they migrate. And so, there’s a lot of work to be done to figure that out. But either way, there’s a potentially pretty big health effect through the pathway of malnutrition, increasing infectious disease deaths, and/or large numbers of people moving, new stress on the – on the health systems and infrastructure for schools where they move to in shorter periods of time than people are normally. You know think of public infrastructure adjusting to it.
So early days, I think, to figure out all these different pathways. But when you see the – like, the floods right now in Brazil, I think we will see more in the public consciousness the sort of immediate effects of some of the climate changes – or potentially, you know, because of attribution issues. And it’ll just keep coming back into the public consciousness.
Dr. Morrison: And as we were discussing earlier – and I think you made reference to this, Angela – some of the areas like West Africa, Francophone West Africa, are, in fact, really in the firing line on these phenomena, but they’re places where we’ve disinvested or not invested historically as a priority, and the security environment has deteriorated. The governing environment has deteriorated. The U.S. has been thrown out of Niger in terms of its security engagement. The French have been thrown out. Russians are back in – back in spades. How are we supposed to – and yet, that’s sort of a showcase – when you think about climate now, that’s sort of a showcase of what we – of what the future may look like. The barriers, the obstacles politically and in terms of security are fairly formidable. Say a bit about that. Like, how do you begin to make the case for taking another look at what it means for these parts of the world?
Dr. Apeagyei: I think our best case is being made in the real implications of inactions that we can see, right, over time in the Sahel and some of these other areas that you already highlighted. And so, finding a way to bring – it’s easy, I think, for us to be removed from the direct impacts of some of these activities because we are not closely engaged. And so, finding a way to bring some of this reality into the corridors that we live in, I think, will help bring back the focus, bring back the agency of the importance of addressing some of these issues.
Dr. Morrison: Thank you.
I want to shift the conversation to the – to the political environment here. I mean, a couple of things that have happened of late have sort of drawn our attention to the question of trying to sustain bipartisan support for global health. I mean, the success of over 20 years of investing in PEPFAR, investing in the Global Fund, investing increasingly in Gavi, other areas has rested on a – on a foundation of strong bipartisan support and support coming from foundations, from industry, from public health advocates, from the faith community.
Some of that is really starting to unravel. I mean, we – the one-year reauthorization for PEPFAR was a reflection of several things. One was post-Dobbs the abortion debate comes forward as a – as a vehicle for critiquing – inaccurately, but critiquing – and that gained political will. We’ve seen the changes in the Republican Party itself, and there’s been a generational change. Many of the folks who were present as advocates, present as members of Congress, present as leaders are retiring, and there’s – so there’s a generational shift. There’s the polarization and partisanship that came out of COVID around many of the interventions around COVID that – there was a bit of a spillover effect there, too, onto global health.
So, all of these things have created a more difficult environment. Many of the conservative critics of foreign aid are emphasizing now: How does this investment fit with our confrontation with China? What is the endgame? Do we have a long-term endgame? And how do we begin to update our understanding of what the value of the investment is over the long term?
So, it would seem when you look at the environment here in the United States and you look at these critiques that there’s a need to kind of update the rationale in the dialogue. If we’re going to keep a bipartisan basis, we’re going to have to have a different kind of conversation around these investments in order to move things forward into this next phase. Angela, your thoughts?
Dr. Apeagyei: I think I would go back to a strategy Chris mentioned earlier, which is that we do have new interventions. We’ve also made a lot of progress in the recent past. And to a certain degree, it would be unfortunate if we are not able to find a way to work together to sustain all these gains so that the gains will be lost, and whenever the environment changes, we’ll have to start a little from the scratch and reinvest. And so, I think highlighting how much progress has been made with all the previous investment, as well as the new opportunities we have given all the improvements in technology, to do even more good will be an important way to try and bring renewed energy into bipartisan engagement.
Dr. Morrison: Chris, do you think we have an opening for a different kind of dialogue with conservatives around the future?
Dr. Murray: So, I think there if you – maybe we need to focus more on the problems that you can only solve if you have a global response. You know, obviously, climate, antimicrobial resistance –
Dr. Apeagyei: Pandemics.
Dr. Murray: – pandemics. You can’t solve those problems sort of country by country. And there – you can start to make a case for some of the other big challenges that are out there, but those are – most people would understand that that has to be a sort of coordinated global response. And I wonder if that’s the area to look for some sort of bipartisan support of those. But it might mean – if you do that, if you go the route of where, you know, some sort of – I will use the word with trepidation – collective response is required, that might actually lead you down a path of different priorities than we currently have on global health. But maybe that’s one strategy for building bipartisan engagement.
Dr. Morrison: Yeah.
I was struck in reading your – in reading your report no reference to China in that, really. And why is that? And what – where does China fit in this – in this conversation?
Dr. Murray: Well, Angela will answer. (Laughter.) Your take on Chinese investments?
Dr. Apeagyei: Yeah. Yeah. We do – we do – in the reports, we do not call out China, that’s true. But China is included in the estimates that we generate in the overall calculation of development assistance support, so that’s one area.
I think in terms of the challenges we have going forward, you’re right, China’s engagement with low- and middle-income countries is one area that I think in most circles had been thought of as being a little controversial. That said, I think a lot of their investments are related to infrastructural activities. They do have some significant interests – thinking of the Silk Road Initiative here – in health as well. But I think in the – in the short – in the short interim, the focus is more on the infrastructural investment, and perhaps the inroad there will be finding ways to equip national governments to manage that relationship.
Dr. Morrison: Do you think we need a new dialogue with China on some of these things?
Dr. Murray: I think it’s very hard to ignore China just in terms of its size, its increasing footprint in research, AI. And you know, they’re trying to convince people of their success around COVID management – a separate debate as to that success – in reaching out to other countries. And so, yeah, we need to have a strategy of how we think about engagement with China.
Dr. Morrison: You know, one of the – this is part of the work of our alliance, is looking at the – in terms of U.S.-China dialogue around health, global health, and global health security. At a senior level, at a ministerial level, there has been no dialogue now for five years. That’s a kind of profound reality. And with the deadlock over COVID origins in Wuhan and the politics in this town or China breaking that and getting back into a dialogue that would clearly serve the self-interest of both countries – it’s in their security interest – is proving to be really difficult.
We’ve got 10 different working groups operating now between the Chinese and the U.S. on very sensitive and complicated areas where there’s not a lot of trust, but 10 working groups. Health, there is no working group. There’s been a conscious decision to say, nope, we’re not going to go there. We’ll go there on military, cyber, trade and investment, many other things. But we’ve got this void. We’ve got this gap that’s emerged out of COVID that’s sort of blocking this sort of senior-level dialogue.
Let’s talk about the diplomatic environment. We’re on the edge. We’re heading toward the World Health Assembly. We’ll see what happens in the pandemic treaty negotiations, what outcomes there are, and the negotiations over the international health regulations. We have that coming forward. We have the antimicrobial-resistance high-level meeting and a bunch of other meetings that you’re involved in that are the prelude to that.
Should we be hopeful in this phase about what may come? These negotiations have been hard-fought, difficult. They’ve gone on for over a two-year period on the pandemic treaty in the IHR. But we’ll soon be seeing what may come out of it. Are you optimistic, Angela?
Dr. Apeagyei: I am generally an optimistic person. But in this instance, I want to say I am, yeah, cautiously optimistic. That’s a hard word to even come out, only because the news coming out of some of these meetings and dialogue doesn’t give much hope for optimism here. So –
Dr. Morrison: What do you think is the blockage on progress?
Dr. Apeagyei: Oh, I think, at least related to the pandemic treaty, I think countries are so invested in their own self-interest and not seeing the value there may be in externalities and connection and collaboration for the global interest.
Dr. Morrison: OK. So we’re at a certain risk that this investment of diplomacy – this is a big diplomatic enterprise, right –
Dr. Apeagyei: Yes. Yes.
Dr. Morrison: – coming out of this historic COVID experience may or may not generate –
Dr. Apeagyei: No.
Dr. Morrison: – results. What’s your thoughts?
Dr. Murray: I think it’s – we’re missing a key ingredient in – throughout the whole process, which is a shared understanding of what went wrong during COVID. In fact, it’s really hard to imagine you can get a lot of meaningful consensuses on action when people have very different views of the mistakes.
Dr. Morrison: How do you describe the chasm?
Dr. Murray: Well, there’s – you know, the view that it was the failure of early detection and sort of traditional finding cases and isolating them early on, and therefore the solution is early detection and what I would think of as traditional epidemic response would be – and coordination in that task.
And then hopefully, in that vein, you don’t have to worry about nonpharmaceutical interventions and, you know, did mandates work or not, and some of the controversies swirling around those. And you don’t have to go down the route of some of the more contentious issues around mandates to get vaccinated, right. So, there’s that side; you know, focus on the early – you know, the sort of seven-by-seven-by seven type mantra.
And then there are people who, I think, are convinced, you know, maybe inappropriately, that we – there was this huge overresponse in terms of the nonpharmaceutical interventions and they weren’t really well justified scientifically and broke trust with the public. And so, I think, underneath the controversy – obviously, there’s issues of sovereignty – is people’s interpretation of what would we have done differently in December of 2019 into January that would have changed the outcome.
And so, I think you just end up moving down to this less and less content in what people can agree on because of that difference of analysis of what happened.
Dr. Morrison: Yeah. And what can we hope for out of the high-level meeting on antimicrobial resistance? What do you think, Angela? This is going to be on the margins of the U.N. General Assembly in September.
Dr. Apeagyei: I think Chris is more involved in that conversation.
Dr. Morrison: Should I put that question to him?
Dr. Apeagyei: Yes. (Laughs.)
Dr. Morrison: OK, OK.
Over to you, Chris.
Dr. Murray: Well, you know, the aspirations are lower than a treaty. I’m pretty hopeful, actually, that the work is being done to bring AMR to people’s attention. You know, there’s some package around antibiotic stewardship, One Health, and, maybe most importantly, expanding access generally to antibiotics, not just about AMR, and also the innovation pipeline. So, I think it will have a positive outcome in the sense – but, you know, it’s relative to a lower bar of expectation than people have for the pandemic treaty.
Dr. Morrison: Good. Well, I’m glad to hear that.
So, let’s – while we’re on the optimism side of the equation here, which is how we want to close this conversation, I want to invite anyone from our audience who cares to offer a question or comment. There’s a microphone there. We’ve got a few more minutes here in this program. What should we be focused on in terms of sources of optimism and hope in this period, looking ahead?
Dr. Apeagyei: Again, the new tools in the toolbox.
Dr. Morrison: What specifically gives you the most hope in terms of new technologies or new approaches?
Dr. Apeagyei: I mean, this is not as new, but the HPV vaccine –
Dr. Morrison: Which is getting a resurgent – resurgent levels of commitment and interest.
Dr. Apeagyei: Yes, because that provides some opportunities for hopefully having a generation that doesn’t have to have Hepatitis-C and things like that.
Dr. Morrison: Yes.
Dr. Apeagyei: In addition to that, I think there are opportunities for AI. I’m not as well invested in that space to know the exact ways. But I think there’s a lot of investment that are happening to – especially maybe more applicable in lower-income situations with less resources and being able to leverage a lot of the current technology to leapfrog on some of the interventions that have already existed, but have faced challenges in uptake as well.
Dr. Morrison: Chris, your thoughts? Is AI going to offer a counterbalancing positive impact to the greater stress over resource levels and political commitments?
Dr. Murray: I think AI will just have huge effects. Many will be enormously positive, right? We should be able to deliver even to – you know, anywhere where there’s connectivity. And that’s also something that’s increasingly available; AIDS and diagnosis treatment planning. It’ll accelerate, quite likely, some of the biological innovation pipeline; so, simplify imaging, you know, remotely, all these things. It'll come pretty steadily, I think, over the next five, 10 years.
And then there’s all the risks with AI. So it’ll be a – it is both a huge potential accelerator of progress and also a huge potential risk for, you know, malicious use of AI for bioterrorism, for other things.
Dr. Morrison: Yeah.
Well, we’ve got a few minutes left. I’d like you to talk a little bit about some of the other important related work that’s coming forward. You’ve got a blizzard of work coming out. So, tell us if you have a – give us a few of the top line.
Dr. Murray: Sure. Well, thanks, Steve.
The – we are at the end of a sequence of what we call the capstone papers on the current cycle – the Global Burden of Disease studies, so GBD 2021 started publishing in March on demography, on fertility, which is its own interesting topic, and then on causes of death, you know, the full burden in terms of tallies? And now risk factors this week and forecasting will come out Thursday/Friday. And –
Dr. Morrison: What can we expect in that?
Dr. Murray: Well, I think the forecasting is –
Dr. Morrison: Give us a preview.
Dr. Murray: – really, really interesting because we’ve built up – you know, we started forecasting – interestingly, the first forecasts around burden were in 1997 using a super-simplistic model where there was income, education, and tobacco, and that was the only drivers of health outcomes. And then again at WHO we did another round, but it was – there’s never been another set of full burden forecasts since 2004. So 20 years in the making, an interesting modeling framework that answers both what we think is likely to occur, and then a huge what-if platform where you can turn the dials and say: What if we had a New Zealand – well, former New Zealand-style tobacco-free cohort? What if we did a much better job on air pollution, et cetera?
So what’s in the actual paper is the reference or probabilistic forecast for every country out to 2050 by cause. And then there is a small number of scenarios just sort of getting at the potential to alter the trajectory. That small number of scenarios includes a big NCD package, which has huge potential benefits, and then others around environmental risks.
The headline message is despite all the doom and gloom that we’ve been talking about, despite capturing the effects of heat – the direct effects of heat, we do expect continued progress just as we’ve had for the last, you know, 70 years. And that progress will be slower than in the past – and I’ll come back to what’s driving that – but progress, nevertheless. There will still be large disparities in 2050 between the poorest countries and the richest, but narrowing, right? So it’s generally pretty positive, right, compared to some people who are coming at these issues thinking we are going to see no progress.
Big caveats. The slowdown, where is it coming from? Big chunk of that is the nexus of diet, physical activity, obesity, and blood sugar driving huge expansion of diabetes; and then there’s a component around drug use, which in some countries is exploding and related; and then a component around rising mental disorders and other forms of addiction that all make the progress that we will see less than it could have been. And so, you know, that’s the flavor.
And I think the thing I’m most excited about is that we’re now already lining up a series of other what-if-type analyses. You know, a more comprehensive view of all the pathways for climate coming later this year, we hope. What about AMR trends, building that into the forecasts? We have some U.S. policy-related forecasts for the – for the U.S. across states. And already getting requests from different governments for tailored what-if to their context.
Dr. Morrison: Thank you.
Angela, closing words on the pipeline for your work, things that you’ve got in the works that we haven’t talked about.
Dr. Apeagyei: We’re hoping we can do some work trying to understand how climate change issues impact development assistance for health support as well. So given the interest at least globally, I think that should be meaningful going forward, so.
Dr. Morrison: When will we see that, would you guess?
Dr. Apeagyei: Cautiously, maybe next year, in a year or two. We still need to locate some funding for that work, so.
Dr. Morrison: Yes.
Dr. Apeagyei: Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm.
Dr. Morrison: OK. Well, this has been great. Thank you both. Thank you both for coming to CSIS –
Dr. Apeagyei: Thank you, Steve.
Dr. Morrison: – to be with us today. Congratulations on the – on the report. It’s a terrific piece of work, as usual. And congratulations on all the other great work that IHME is doing. And come back soon. Thanks.
Dr. Murray: Thank you, Steve.
Dr. Apeagyei: Thank you. (Laughs.)
Dr. Morrison: Thank you. (Applause.)

46,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/iran-israel-air-conflict-one-week,Shaan Shaikh,"April 19, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"On April 13, Iran launched a large salvo of missiles and drones at Israel. Designated “Operation True Promise,” the attack reportedly included around 170 drones, 120 surface-to-surface ballistic missiles, and 30 cruise missiles. It came in retaliation to an Israeli airstrike on April 1 against an Iranian diplomatic base in Damascus, Syria, which killed seven officers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), including the Quds Force’s General Mohammad Reza Zahedi. Iran’s attack marked the first time that Tehran has directly attacked Israel from Iranian territory.
On April 18, Israel responded in turn with airstrikes near Isfahan and Tabriz, Iran. Details on this attack are still coming in. Unconfirmed imagery suggests Israel struck at Iranian targets with some number of Sparrow air-launched ballistic missiles. Iranian leaders have claimed that their air defenses fended off the attack, which is unlikely but signals that they will not respond.
Q1: What missiles and drones did Iran use?
A1: Identifying missiles used in combat is hard. Identifying Iranian missiles, which come in a bewildering, visually similar number of derivatives and modifications, is even harder.
Iranian state-run media has claimed the use of the Emad and Kheibar Shekan-1 ballistic missiles, Paveh cruise missiles, and Shahed drones. Other reports mention possible use of the Ghadr ballistic missile. The drones employed are widely reported as Shahed-131 and -136 variants.
Brigadier General Hajizadeh, commander of the IRGC Aerospace Force, stated that Iran did not use its supposedly higher-end Khorramshahr, Sejjil, Kheibar Shekan-2, or Fatah ballistic missiles. The Washington Post has added that Iran did not appear to launch the Shahab-3.
Q2: Did Iran intend to limit Israeli casualties?
A2: Somewhat. U.S. and Iranian leaders reportedly engaged in back-channel conversations to discuss redlines and expectations over the past few weeks. Iranian leadership publicly warned about the forthcoming attack, and Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian claims to have given neighboring countries 72-hour notice before the attack. Once Operation True Promise commenced, incoming drones appeared on social media hours before reaching Israel.
To be sure, Iran’s decision to fire over 300 projectiles at Israel still suggests a high acceptance of risk for casualties, damage, and further escalation. Following reports of air defense success, one IRGC leader claimed that Iran used older and less sophisticated missiles in its attack. Perhaps this is why one U.S. official found that roughly 50 percent of Iran’s ballistic missiles failed on launch or in flight. However, it is difficult to validate Iran’s claim. It is doubtful that Iran held off using Khorramshahr missiles, for example, to avoid additional escalation risks.
Media reports have also exaggerated Iran’s intentions to limit casualties in the past. When Iran struck Al-Asad air base in Iraq in January 2020, for example, reports quickly established a misperception that Iran purposely avoided killing American service members. It took time before analysts noted that Iran did not “aim to miss” U.S. service members. Over 100 U.S. service members suffered traumatic brain injuries, with 80 troops awarded Purple Hearts. It is a miracle that Americans did not die.
Q3: How did Israeli air defenses perform against Iran’s attack?
A3: This episode represents an outstanding success story for air and missile defense. Despite the over 300 ballistic missiles, drones, and cruise missiles launched, there appears to have been minimal damage to Israeli infrastructure and military assets, and the attack resulted in only one Israeli casualty.
It was also a joint effort. The coalition was led by the United States and featured the United Kingdom, France, and Jordan, in addition to Israel. Coordination took place at the Combined Air Operations Center at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which helped to prevent any friendly fire incidents. Although Saudi Arabia has denied direct involvement, the kingdom at least allowed U.S. aircraft stationed in the country to engage Iranian air threats. Israel’s Arab neighbors also may have contributed intelligence and sensor assets to detect and track Iranian air threats, although the extent of this cooperation remains unclear. U.S. policymakers have long advocated for an integrated missile defense in the region, and this joint operation helps illustrate why.
In an era of missile warfare, missile defenses have proven their worth. This has been demonstrated repeatedly in Saudi Arabia against the Houthis, in Ukraine against Russia, and now in Israel against Iran. It was only a few years ago that analysts confidently claimed that defenses do not work. Yet in this operation, U.S. Central Command stated that it took down at least six ballistic missiles; the U.S. Navy employed SM-3 interceptors for the first time in combat, which were reportedly successful; and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) of course employed its own air defenses. Air and missile defense works, saves lives, and reduces pressure on policymakers to respond immediately or excessively.
More will be revealed about the air and missile defense story in the coming weeks. An IDF spokesperson has claimed a 99 percent intercept rate. It is unclear if this figure includes Iranian missiles that failed at launch or in flight, or those that struck uninhabited areas. It is also unclear if Israel is identifying smaller surface-to-surface rockets as “ballistic missiles,” which fly farther and hit harder. In any case, even if the IDF eventually lowers this figure, coalition air and missile defenses clearly performed well in this operation.
Q4: What is known about Israel’s response?
A4: Most defense analysts correctly assessed that Israel would retaliate militarily. The question on everyone’s mind was the magnitude of the response. The Biden administration lobbied to minimize the strike to reduce further tit-for-tat attacks. If Israel’s attack was sufficiently limited, Iran may not respond, having dealt what it deems to be sufficient damage. That, at least, was the hope.
It increasingly appears that those hopes were actualized. Current reporting suggests Israel’s strike was limited and the IDF gave notice to U.S. policymakers before engaging Iran. The IRGC claims that its air defenses fended off the attack, which seems unlikely given Iranian capabilities but suggests that Iran will not respond.
Q5: What happens now?
A5: We’re back to a tenuous status quo. Iran has shown that attacks on diplomatic facilities—even those in Syria—will not be tolerated. Israel has shown that its air and missile defenses, when coordinated with the United States and regional partners, are extremely capable and that it will respond to Iranian attacks on Israeli territory. 
The Iran-Israel conflict also serves as a reminder that countries do not just stumble into war. Leaders climb onto the escalation ladder willingly and in turn generate dynamics that they cannot easily unmake. The question now is how the United States and others can unwind these dynamics for a more stable, peaceful security environment. Missile defense plays a critical role, but technology won’t save Israel from having to answer hard questions over its security strategy.
Looking forward, Israeli policymakers will face difficult trade-offs in managing their national security priorities. Hamas’s October 7 attacks inevitably pulled Israel into Gaza, but Israeli policymakers have chosen a maximalist approach that has pushed allies and partners away. These same relationships, particularly with the United States and Israel’s Arab neighbors, are especially important given their mutual aims in deterring and defeating Iranian aggression. Perhaps this week’s conflict—and the cooperation it prompted—may serve as a reminder of that common goal.

47,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/china-and-middle-east,Jon B. Alterman,"April 19, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"Jon Alterman testified before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission about China’s diplomatic engagement with the Middle East and the country’s efforts to shape a new world order. Commissioner Friedberg, Commissioner Stivers, distinguished members of the Commission, I am honored to share my views with you on China’s Middle East ties. CSIS does not take policy positions, so the views represented in this testimony are my own and not those of my employer.
In my testimony, I would like to give you my assessment of China’s ambitions in the Middle East, and the Middle East’s ambitions with China. I have been exploring this subject for almost 20 years, and it has evolved considerably. It is my strong sense that we wrongly assume that China is interested in winning a symmetrical competition with us, and we underestimate the extent to which China is seeking to reshape competition on more favorable terms. We also underestimate the extent to which our partners in the Middle East welcome Chinese influence as a check on what they see as U.S. excesses. They seek to sustain their strong ties with us while simultaneously building stronger ties with China. The consistent message from China is that doing so is both possible and desirable, and they should undermine U.S. efforts to divide them from China. In the process, China seeks to peel the region away from the United States and advance China’s strategic goal of a more globally unaligned world.
China’s Regional View
China became a net oil importer in 1993; since then, about half China’s oil has come from the Middle East. China therefore has found itself persistently reliant on a region that the United States continues to dominate, and its investments have been steady for decades.
Chinese strategic thinkers see the Middle East as a place with far more peril than promise.
The region has a history of both intra-regional strife and domestic unrest, and China is concerned that extremist ideologies originating in the region will infect western China. China is also concerned that the Middle East is well within the U.S. sphere of influence, and differences over the region could precipitate a U.S.-China conflict. As I understand it, China feels it cannot afford to be disengaged in the Middle East, but its engagement must be selective. In addition, China’s actions in the Middle East are clearly subordinate to its global strategic concerns, the most significant of which is its rivalry with the United States.
The Chinese position in the Middle East has been dynamic for the last quarter-century, not least because the U.S. position in the region has been dynamic. China has developed strong relations with U.S. allies and adversaries alike, building robust commercial ties all along the way. Several years ago, Indian Minister of External Affairs S. Jaishankar said, “For the last 20 years, the United States has been fighting but not winning in the Middle East, and China has been winning but not fighting in the Middle East.” That seems accurate to me.
To a remarkable degree, there is great regional enthusiasm for stronger relationships with China. In part, this stems from a general sense that China is a rising power in the world, and closer ties with the country are prudent. But the most significant driver of this enthusiasm is a mutual belief that energy brings the two regions together. Beginning in the late 20th century, China became the single largest driver of energy demand growth in the world. The rapidly expanding Chinese industrial base was hungry for oil, and the Middle East has the only exporters who could meet that growing need. As demand plateaued in the United States and began to fall in Europe, it was China’s growth that kept global demand growing. It became unthinkable for energy producers not to seek to grow their relationships with China as a consequence.
There is also deep admiration for China’s economic growth, and quiet appreciation for the fact that China has grown strongly without making the concessions to the political, economic, and social liberalism that Western states often insist are necessary for prosperity and stability. The Belt and Road Initiative was a masterstroke of branding, persuading state after state in the Middle East that it could play a central role in the geostrategic calculations of the world’s greatest rising power, with each imagining the growing power it would accrue as a result. Of course, the dividends of the Belt and Road initiative in the Middle East are scant, but the residual desire to engage more closely with China endures.
The Middle East also has suffered from growing disenchantment with the United States. For decades there has been disappointment with U.S. policy toward the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and this disappointment and anger has become acute in the late six months. There was also frustration that U.S.-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan had little justification in the international law the United States claimed to be upholding, and the United States prosecuted the wars while indifferent to the civilian casualties they imposed. Governments were discomforted by the U.S. embrace of democratization in the Arab Spring, they complained of U.S. abandonment as the Obama administration announced its rebalancing toward Asia, and Arab governments complained that U.S. policy toward Iran was recklessly empowering the Islamic Republic.
Countries and populations felt that a closer relationship with China would give them the ability to resist U.S. hegemony and resist demands to reshape their domestic and foreign policy to reflect U.S. preferences. Even U.S. partners and allies felt that the U.S. had enjoyed monopoly power in the Middle East for two long, and competition would benefit them.
In this, China had a great deal to offer. Not only did China have the aura of geostrategic heft, but it brought economic resources to bear. Trade relationships have grown exponentially over the last two decades, through massive energy exports, the importation of Chinese manufactured goods, and the extensive use of Chinese companies to build infrastructure, housing, factories, and more. Where Western companies moved slowly toward agreements, sought external financing, and had extensive regulations that governed everything from environmental protection to anti-corruption statutes, Chinese companies were one-stop shops in league with the government, they were happy to build things quickly if not always well, and they were open to the costs of doing business in an environment with extensive patronage networks.
China doesn't want to supplant the United States in the Middle East but wants to supplement the United States in the Middle East. China also doesn't want to sacrifice much to advance any of its interests in the Middle East. Where it invests, it does so deliberately.
China, as you know, has created a hierarchy of relationships, with the most elevated being a “comprehensive strategic partnership.” In the Middle East, it has such a partnership with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Iran, Egypt, and Algeria. The latter, it feels to me, is mostly sentimental, tied to the links the two revolutionary countries established in the 1950s and have sustained in the decades since. As China has become more market-oriented, it has turned a mercantile eye toward regional states, making shrewd efforts to build ties where they have the most potential for China.
Saudi Arabia
Saudi Arabia has been among the Middle Eastern countries most interested in courting China. Part of the interest is simply about energy: China was driving global growth and Saudi Arabia has the world’s largest proven oil reserves. As Saudi Arabia sees its role as “the world’s central banker of oil,” it would be ludicrous in the Saudi view not to build a close relationship with the world’s largest customer for imported oil. Strategically, Saudi Arabia also sought to displace Iran as China's largest foreign supplier of energy. From a Saudi perspective, closer trade relations with China puts a cap on how close Iranian-Chinese relations can grow and gives the Saudis some assurances that China will not advance Iranian interests in international forums.
Saudi Arabia began engaging more deeply with Chinese firms when it sought low-cost construction options amidst a slumping economy in the 1990s. When oil prices rose in the 2000s and the Saudi economy was flush with cash, Chinese-Saudi trade grew strongly. In 2012, China and Saudi Aramco agreed to build a massive refinery together in Yanbu, on the Red Sea. Within four years, the refinery was operational, processing about 400,000 barrels per day of crude. China has built some of the country’s most important projects in the last two decades, including light rail, desalination plants, and industrial estates. China is intimately involved in building out the Saudi IT backbone, and Chinese firms are key partners in constructing NEOM, the futuristic city on the Red Sea.
China has explicitly sought to portray itself as an essential strategic partner to Saudi Arabia. It has done so partly in the wake of Saudi concerns that the United States has been abandoning the Middle East as it pivots toward Asia, and partly by marketing the idea that the Chinese experience in economic growth holds lessons for Saudi Arabia’s own ambitious economic diversification efforts. China has portrayed itself as an essential partner to Saudi Vision 2030, which Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has used as a focus for Saudi Arabia’s economic planning.
In recent years, Saudi Arabia has had a sustained but superficial fascination with Deng Xiaoping's efforts in the 1980s to transition China from a relatively poor and parochial Maoist dictatorship to a robust and cosmopolitan global economic powerhouse. I recently wrote a paper on Middle Eastern states’ understanding of the China model, and one of the fascinating examples is a modern art exhibit in Diriyya a couple of years ago that was curated by an American curator of modern Chinese art. The exhibit was entitled, “Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones,” a phrase attributed to Deng Xiaoping. An explanatory panel explained, “When it was coined, this maxim referred to strategies for implementing and adapting to the massive economic and cultural transformations that were then taking place. Saudi Arabia finds itself today in a similar moment of optimistic energy, willingness to ask questions, and openness to new futures.”
The Chinese-Saudi relationship is more robust than merely an energy relationship. There is also a military strand that runs through bilateral ties. Starting in the 1980s, Saudi Arabia occasionally saw China as a source for weapons that the United States would not provide, such as the CSS-2 missiles. This trend has continued, with China reportedly selling Saudi Arabia drone aircrafts and helping Saudi Arabia build ballistic missiles. There seems to be extensive Chinese involvement in efforts at domestic surveillance.
Even so, when it comes to human capital, the Chinese are not very present. The Chinese have no role, for example, in extensive Saudi efforts to reform their defense establishment, which are being done along an Anglo-American model. There’s also little evidence that China helps provide management training to senior Saudis, whose experience is almost entirely Western (and mostly American). Given that there is such a huge need in the Kingdom for management expertise for a vastly growing enterprise, and given the role of Western institutions providing it, this appears to provide a ceiling for how closely Chinese ties can develop.
Even so, ties are clearly developing. Saudi interlocutors have told me that Chinese representatives often come in and explicitly red team the United States. When they make an offer, they also predict what the United States would do, the kinds of conditions it would impose and the timelines it would give. They explain why their offer is better, and by Saudi estimates, they understand the U.S. position as well as Americans.
The Saudi ambition to draw closer to China grew after U.S. outrage at the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and now-President Biden’s promise during the 2020 presidential campaign that he would treat the Saudis “like the pariahs that they are.” This ambition has dampened in recent years, partly because the Biden administration has reassured Saudi Arabia that it is not hostile, and because China's regional diplomacy has demonstrated it is no substitute for the United States. While some expected that the Chinese role brokering a Saudi-Iranian agreement a year ago was a sign of China’s regional diplomatic clout, it was largely Saudi determination that drove the diplomacy—including China’s own involvement—and China has played no serious role trying to resolve the conflict in Gaza or resolving issues in Yemen, which is a long running Saudi security concern.
It is clear to Saudis that the country needs a robust relationship with China. Even if China doesn't replace the United States, Saudi Arabia sees China as an important check on the United States, and an important supplement to what the United States is willing to provide to China.
United Arab Emirates
The UAE has an even more complicated relationship with China than Saudi Arabia, in part because the UAE has distinctive sets of interests within a single country. Dubai has been a trading entrepot for centuries, and China’s global trade and Dubai’s role as a vital global transshipment point have grown in tandem. Today, 60 percent of China’s trade with Europe and Africa passes through the UAE (mostly Dubai), as does a large percentage of its trade with the Middle East. About a quarter-million Chinese live in the UAE, again mostly in Dubai, compared to only a million Emirati citizens in the whole country. Chinese firms have driven much of the construction in Dubai, and the country’s mercantilist spirit jogs quite well with the Dubai business community. Chinese organized crime operates in Dubai as well, including gambling enterprises, and the Dubai police closely monitor its progress.
Abu Dhabi is less interested in transshipment and trade, and much more focused on its role as a major oil exporter. As such, the Abu Dhabi leadership concentrates on security and geopolitics. As in Saudi Arabia, there appears to be extensive cooperation between the national government and China on domestic security issues including surveillance, but Abu Dhabi works extensively with other security providers including Israel to bolster its surveillance capability. Abu Dhabi had a close partnership with China in the early months of the COVID pandemic on both testing and vaccines, although that cooperation dimmed when evidence emerged that the Chinese vaccine was much less effective than Western versions. While there were reports about a year ago that China was working closely with Abu Dhabi on artificial intelligence (ironically or perhaps significantly, led by a company chaired by the UAE national security advisor), some of that cooperation seems to have cooled, presumably in alignment with U.S. concerns.
The Abu Dhabi government increasingly has sought to strike an “active neutrality” posture in the world, retaining intimate ties with the United States but growing substantial ties with Russia and China. After the invasion of Ukraine, billions of dollars and thousands of Russians found safe haven in the UAE, despite—and arguably because of—U.S.-led sanctions on Russia. In a widely reported incident, in late 2021 the UAE shut down construction of what U.S. officials claimed was a Chinese military facility in Khalifa Port in Abu Dhabi, although there have been scattered reports that construction has continued.
The issue is not so much that there is overt tension between the United States and the UAE, but rather that the UAE has a growing sense that it is large enough and powerful enough to advance its own interests and should not slavishly follow the diktats of the United States. Whereas Saudi Arabia feels like it is embarking on a transformation, the UAE is more self-confident that its transformation has been underway for decades. The UAE sees itself as a regional thought leader, and the model it has demonstrated is one of careful balance between regional and global concerns, Western and Arab mores, and private and public capital development.
The UAE’s balancing reflects itself in complicated ways in domestic affairs. In foreign policy, though, it feels more straightforward. Perhaps surprisingly, the tiny UAE seems to have adopted a foreign policy that is in line with that advocated by India, a growing global heavyweight. Ties between the two, which date back centuries, are interesting. India is closer to the UAE than Kuwait, and there are more than two and a half times as many Indian citizens in the UAE as Emiratis in the UAE. Despite the large disparities in size—with India’s population almost 15 times that of the UAE when the UAE includes expatriates, and 150 times its size without them—the two countries have leaders with strong domestic support who share a vision of not needing to fall in line with a world that's broken into blocs.
Iran
Rather than seek to balance within the global system like the UAE, Iran seeks to undermine the structure of that system, which the Iranian leadership sees as hostile to Iran. In this effort, China is an eager partner. Both countries share discomfort with what the United States claims is a “rules-based order” and which China and Iran agree is an order that is intended to constrain them. In addition, China prefers a world in which the United States is bogged down in the Middle East and alienates much of the Global South through its actions there. In a way, sustained U.S.-Iran tensions are a manifestation of the United States trying to impose its will on a smaller state, and many countries feel some combination of solidarity and sympathy with Iran. China is eager to stand by Iran as long as it doesn’t cost China much. In 2021, China and Iran made headlines by signing a 25-year cooperation agreement that promised a $400 billion investment in the Iranian economy. While the agreement made headlines, implementation has been weak at best, and the more Iran has seemed desperate for Chinese investment, the scarcer it has proven to be.
Despite common cause, there are vast disparities between China and Iran. The starkest area is economics. China represents about a third of Iranian trade, but Iran represents less than one percent of Chinese trade. It is clear who is in control of this relationship. Time after time, China has instrumentalized its relationship with Iran in order to advance Chinese interests. In political science terms, the Iranian-Chinese relationship is always a dependent variable based on China's other interests in the world. The Iranians both resent this and know there's nothing they can do about it.
It was a little bit surprising to me China has not been more outspoken about Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping. Iran supports the Houthis with arms, cash, and reportedly with some targeting data. Attacks on shipping does more than hurt Chinese trade with Europe. Chinese ships have now been attacked despite Houthi promises they would not be, and the need to circumnavigate Africa has added to cost delays. In addition, the Houthis attacks have cut Suez Canal revenues in half since the first of the year, denying billions of dollars in hard current to a country with which China has a comprehensive strategic partnership and in which China has invested billions of dollars in recent years. It seems to me that’s a reflection of two things. The first is that China has decided it can't have much of an impact. But the second and more important aspect is that it reveals that virtually everything China does in the Middle East is with an eye toward its most serious consideration: strategic competition with the United States.
China plays off the two beautifully. In circumventing U.S. sanctions by purchasing Iranian crude oil, China simultaneously undermines the U.S. ability to use the international financial system to sanction adversaries while gaining access to discounted oil. For China, this is a win-win solution, but the strategic goals (constraining U.S. hegemony, undermining the centrality of the global dollar economy, and demonstrating the inability of the United States to strangle the economies of its adversaries) are even more important than near-term economic benefit. China is guarding against a world in which the United States might seek to isolate China, and chipping away at its ability to do so is a central Chinese concern.
Israel
Israel is a close U.S. ally that actively courted China starting in the early 2000s, and China responded in kind. China not only sought Israeli counterterrorism assistance in the years after 9/11, but it also saw Israel is an important source of technical expertise. Chinese firms began investing in Israel, for example buying the country’s largest dairy producer in 2014, but that wasn’t where the real news was. About a decade ago, concern began to grow in the United States that China would use Israeli technology and the infrastructure it was building in Israel to advance Chinese espionage efforts. Israelis were dismissive of that fear 10 years ago, but in the last five have seemed to be more open to U.S. concerns. Whether that is a result of what Israelis themselves saw, what Americans were able to persuade them of, or a general assessment that the U.S. relationship needed to be protected is unclear.
But the largest shift in China-Israel ties came in the weeks and months after October 7. China has been openly critical of Israel and has shown little sympathy for Israel’s assertions that it is in an existential struggle against a terrorist group. Instead, China has swung firmly behind a strategy of showing solidarity with the Global South, and thus siding with Palestinians over Israelis. We haven't yet seen this manifest in terms of disinvestment, but there is certainly less engagement, and the scars of this conflict are likely to run deep. Even so, it is likely that China will seek to reassert itself when the conflict begins to ebb. If there is some sort of broad international effort to resolve the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, China is certain to pursue a central role in that effort as a matter of prestige. From that position, China is likely to seek to revive its relationship with Israel.
China And the Global South
China’s role in the Gaza conflict now has been almost entirely opportunistic. While China’s default position has been to favor states over non-state actors, China slid quickly into a position expressing solidarity between the countries of the Global South and Palestinians. China has had little positive to say to Israel, and its messaging stresses the hypocrisy of a U.S. position that on the one hand advocates international law but also turns away from any responsibility to protect Palestinian civilians from Israeli Army assault.
The difference between Chinese relations in the Middle East versus a place like Latin America or Africa is that China sees the region as having difficult—some in China would say intractable—security challenges. China sees little advantage in working to resolve them, and little capacity to do so. Instead, China seeks to position itself behind the United States, allowing the United States to get sucked in. China is focused on two things in the region: ensuring its competition with the United States does not escalate to outright conflict, and not replacing the United States. Instead, China sees the Middle East as the point of the spear of creating a different world which is more mercantilist and less committed to international law and multilateralism. The more international relations revolve around the bilateral relations between states, the better it is for China, which is the stronger party in all of its bilateral relations except with the United States.
Recommendations
While the overall frame of U.S. foreign policy is increasingly focused on competition with China, the U.S. government must understand that China is committed to asymmetrical competition in the Middle East. At the same time, Chinese strategy in the Middle East is focused on China’s global rivalry with the United States. Understanding these two distinct points is vital to constructing an appropriate U.S. policy toward China’s role in the region.
Similarly, it is appropriate to understand the Chinese-Iranian relationship for what it is, and not mistake it for what it isn’t. Iran is a tool for China to use in China’s relations with the United States, and China will not make sacrifices for Iranian benefit. There is no alliance here, and the prospect of one should be less alarming to U.S. officials than many seem to assume.
It is important to continue to articulate the S. government view that while it is appropriate for countries to develop close economic ties with China, it is also appropriate to be wary of China’s actions. China has an interest in saying the United States is forcing countries to choose, and they should resist out of their own economic interest. It cannot be repeated enough that the volume of U.S. trade with China is prima facie evidence that the United States does not object to economic ties.
China’s passivity and frequent irrelevance to addressing the robust security challenges facing the Middle East today, and the central role U.S. diplomacy plays in seeking to resolve them, should give the lie to the theory that the United States is leaving the region and China is the rising power in the Middle East. Neither is true, and the S. government should remind regional governments why.
There are any number of polls that attest to the popularity of China and the unpopularity of the United States in the Middle East, yet public opinion polls on foreign policy are not reliable indicators of Middle Eastern governments’ behaviors. Regional rulers are presumed to have the prerogative to make foreign policy as they see fit. Regional leaderships are fascinated by China in a superficial way, but they don’t know much about China. They are mostly interested in the way China’s example seems to refute Western insistence on their need to adopt liberalism. The United States should focus less on issues of political ideology and more on the fact that human capital development is the only way the Middle East can make it through the energy transition whole. The unique value proposition of Western education and training versus the Chinese model is irrefutable and gives a strong strategic advantage to sustained influence of the United States and its allies."

Daniel F. Runde: OK. Thanks, everybody. Good morning and welcome to our eighth CSIS Development Forum. We could not have done this without our partners at Chevron. Chevron, you have been such a great friend. Thank you so much. I’m really, really grateful to you. I also want to thank Noam Unger and Madeleine McLean, along with the extended team at CSIS, for all your efforts to make this happen. Thank you so much.
This year’s GDF will explore many of the challenges and opportunities we face in the Global South. Clearly, the United States and the rest of the world are interdependent. I would argue, the world is a much better place with American leadership. Much of that leadership requires non-military forms of our power, including development and other forms of soft power. And that’s why I wrote my book, “The American Imperative.”
To begin our forum today, we’re going to hear from my friend, Chairman Mike Gallagher. I’m really pleased that Congressman Gallagher is here for one of his last public events as chairman of the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. I understand that he’s extending his stay in D.C. through Saturday to help with the Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan, and border bills. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for doing that. It’s really important.
I’ve known Congressman Gallagher for a long time. I’m not going to go through a long version of his biography. He was a U.S. Marine Corps intelligence officer. He twice deployed to Iraq. He speaks Arabic. He was also a Republican staffer on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But I got to know him best when he was the foreign policy adviser to Governor Walker’s campaign for president in 2015. I’m proud to say I was one of the folks who encouraged then-civilian Mike Gallagher to run for office.
Two of my kids, Danny and Benji, and I knocked on 100 doors for him in Green Bay, Wisconsin in October 2016. That was a bribe. I made them – I said, you can go to a Green Bay Packers game if you knock on 100 doors from Mike Gallagher. (Laughter.) And it worked. So but I’ve told my children that Chairman Gallagher is someone they can look up to in public life, and they really do. So he’s done an incredible public service through his work as chairman of the select committee. Mr. Chairman, I want to flag that you have the finest staffers in the U.S. Congress working at the select committee. The work your committee has done has been some of the most consequential work of this Congress. That’s true.
In my book, I argue that we have a bipartisan consensus agreeing that we have a problem with the Chinese Communist Party and Vladimir Putin’s murderous regime. However, we do not yet have a bipartisan consensus about what the heck to do about this. So I think a big part of the work of the select committee has been to help us identify some of the steps that we need to do to do something about this problem. So I know, Congressman, that you’re, quote/unquote, “retiring from Congress.” But I hope this is not your last act in public life.
So, Chairman Gallagher, thank you for being with us today. I’m going to turn the floor over to you now. Please welcome Chairman Mike Gallagher. (Applause.)
Representative Mike Gallagher: Thank you, Dan. I vividly remember when you came to Green Bay, Wisconsin with your kids, and bribed them. It was very effective. It was a very effective bribe. (Laughter.) So if I ever run for office in the future, I’m going to need that same whole-of-Runde commitment – team Rundy.
Well, thank you for having me here today in this incredible facility. Thanks to everyone who made this event possible. Thanks to Dan for his intellectual leadership. Dan has spent two decades working on development issues and watching the Chinese Communist Party burrow its way into international institutions firsthand. He’s seen Beijing’s emissaries arrive in capitals around the world with cash and promises of infrastructure investment. He’s seen why it’s so important for America to be there to offer an alternative. You could say he wrote the book on the subject, and he did. And I strongly recommend this book. I think even blurbed this book, Dan. So we have a no limits partnership, Dan and I. (Laughter.)
I want to be blunt. I believe we are in a new Cold War with the Chinese Communist Party, with a great-power adversary that’s able to compete with us economically, not just militarily. And I believe if we lose, it will not just be a matter of different spheres of influence but, in some ways, it could be the end of the democratic system, both around the world and even here at home. It’s a cold war fought not on the military battlefield but in the corridors of the United Nations in New York and the capitals of more than 100 countries around the world. It’s a contest over ports, bridges, mines, and 5G networks. Its weapons include loans, grants, aid, assistance, diplomacy, even medicine. And the stakes include the autonomy of the Global South, whether international institutions will truly be free, and ultimately the destiny of humanity.
The CCP seeks not to liberate the people of the Global South from poverty, but to forge new chains of debt and digital surveillance with which to suppress them, enslave them. The CCP spreads their vision of authoritarianism by exporting surveillance technology and infrastructure to client dictatorships, creating a network of client states. Through initiatives like the Digital Silk Road, they entrench their influence. And as members of the select committee witnessed firsthand during a trip to the Solomon Islands last year, this can have devastating consequences. The CCP seeks to monopolize the supply chains for natural resources such as cobalt, copper, and rare earth elements that are vital to the global economy.
They lock in countries, like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Bolivia. They lock them into exploitative, corrupt deals. Their vision for the Global South is one of debt-trap diplomacy where the CCP and local cartels share the spoils and the natural resources extracted from beneath the feet of millions travel along one road to one destination and that’s to Beijing.
This is a vision – their vision is a common destiny for mankind where the CCP rules through dependent authoritarian proxies and billions can look forward to the future that the Chinese people suffer under today.
This is a world where they hold a monopoly on the processing of raw materials such as lithium and rare earth elements, where a transition to an electric future means trading energy independence for dependence on a regime that’s actively working to displace us and drive a wedge between us and our allies and partner.
This is a world where they control international organizations and rules apply to every country but one, where the Chinese chairman of the International Telecom Union champions Huawei and the United Nations industrial development organization promotes the Belt and Road Initiative.
America’s engagement in the Global South, therefore, is not merely about countering the CCP’s development and investment strategies but also recognizing that political and economic independence must go hand in hand. Halting the spread of Chinese communist authoritarianism, advancing the economic security of the United States and its allies, and promoting sustainable development worldwide go hand in hand.
Where the CCP seeks to export authoritarianism, the United States should advance freedom, transparency, and democratic governance. Where they seek to exploit resources, the United States should promote investment to help countries move up the value chain in critical industries.
Where the CCP seeks to control international bodies, America must rally behind credible alternative candidates for key offices. And, most importantly, the United States must understand that it’s not 1995 anymore. We can no longer just dictate the global rules unchallenged, not in the Taiwan Strait, not, as we learned, in Ukraine or the Middle East, and not in Latin America or Africa.
We cannot tell nations to avoid trade with the CCP unless we can offer them comparable products at competitive prices. We cannot tell these nations to avoid Belt and Road investment unless we can connect them with Western firms willing to build infrastructure or manage ports.
We cannot tell them to avoid Huawei unless we can offer them an alternative method to connect their populations to the internet. We cannot tell them to avoid Chinese vaccines or treatments unless we can make our own available.
They know the CCP. They do not trust the CCP, either to deliver a quality product or not use its leverage for coercion. They know of Sri Lanka, forced into economic collapse because of debts incurred building a port, which Beijing recently repossessed.
They see how Angola has turned to the West after firsthand exposure to the low quality of Chinese infrastructure projects. But, most importantly, they know the United States. They can contrast the CCP’s record in Pakistan, Burma, and Iran with the success stories of post-World War II South Korea, Germany, and Japan.
The selfishness of a Beijing loan condition – they can contrast with a genuine win-win approach of the Marshall Plan. These American success stories are not just in the past. Before Plan Colombia, that nation was seen as a failed state. Now it’s a democracy that is among the most prosperous in Latin America.
Twenty years ago, AIDS was an angel of death stalking the continent of Africa. USAID’s PEPFAR did not just save the lives of millions of Africans from AIDS; they restored the confidence of a generation, allowing them to plan for a future they could not otherwise have imagined.
America should accept the credit for saving 25 million lives and then build on that opportunity by putting the private sector to work. We need to engage directly with governments in the Global South, track opportunities such as ports coming up for sale, and work closely to provide alternative sources of investment.
When American officials undertake high-level visits they should not shy away from connecting officials in the Global South with American firms who can do a better job than their Chinese competitors.
We need to step up to aggressively counter CCP influence in multilateral institutions. That means wielding our own weight against Chinese cooption and recruiting viable alternative candidates for global leadership roles rather than just waiting until after Beijing’s picks have secured an election.
We need to recognize that political security and economic security are intertwined and do a better job of aligning the Department of Defense with our economic development agencies. The recent coups in the Sahel of Africa provide an example of what may happen when we focus solely on counterinsurgency or military matters while allowing Chinese and Russian interests to dominate everything else. We need to change the entire mindset of U.S. international investment and stop viewing development and aid as charity.
Calvin Coolidge famously said once that the chief business of America is business. I think that remains largely true today, in the 21st century. The power of the American private sector remains the secret weapon that our adversaries cannot match. Beijing may offer cheap credit to state-owned enterprises doing cheap work, but America, particularly when we’re working together with our partners around the world, can do better. We can mobilize our capital markets, our private investors, and free enterprise to help the cause. This is a strategic priority, and we should treat it as such. Our contributions have transformed the lives of millions, and the population of the Global South is ready to take their place in the sun, with the confidence we have done much to inspire. But if the CCP are the only ones who are willing to build roads and ports or telecom networks, of course they’ll go with that option. Being there for the Global South is not about charity, it’s about championing our own national interests.
And before I turn the mic back over to Dan, I would like to take a moment to reflect on my own modest role in this struggle. As I’m sure – as Dan alluded to and I’m sure many of you are aware, my time in Congress and my time as chairman of the Select Committee of the CCP will soon come to an end. And I know there have been some here at CSIS who have been critical of the committee’s work and my own rhetoric, arguing that it feeds into paranoia and questioning whether I was making a cynical political ploy. I thought a lot about this sort of criticism as people have asked me how I would like the committee and its work to be remembered. And part of that answer is very easy. Of course I want our work to be remembered as a thorough, good-faith, and, in some ways, revolutionary approach that was comprehensive and bipartisan in nature.
But that’s not all. It might surprise you that in some ways I’d like our work to be remembered 10 years from now as alarmist. That might seem strange; after all, when this committee was first formed, that’s what most of our most strident critics called us. But the truth is that every night I pray that we’re wrong about the brutal, tyrannical essence of the Chinese Communist Party. I hope that Xi Jinping alters his course. I hope that in 10 years Taiwan remains a thriving democracy, a beacon of hope. I hope freedoms return to Hong Kong. I hope the concentration camps are emptied in Xinjiang. I hope the colonial boarding schools are closed in Tibet and the Dalai Lama is able to return. And I hope that the CCP ends its corrosive industrial policy, stops its wholesale IP theft, grants freedom to its citizens, halts its spiraling military buildup and territorial ambition, and, as we uncovered in a bipartisan report released earlier this week, that it stops subsidizing the onslaught of fentanyl that’s destroying communities across this nation. And if the price for all these things is that our committee or that me in particular are remembered as operating in good faith but being alarmist, then that’s a price I would pay a million times over.
But in the absence of divine intervention, winning this competition, winning the new cold war will be very difficult. It will be simple but not easy. We must answer the call of history to defend our interests and our values against authoritarian aggression across every domain. It will take dogged and bipartisan work day in and day out for years and, in all likelihood, decades. But as I’d like to think, and as our little committee has proven, Republicans and Democrats can still work together and rise to the occasion, as generations of Americans did before us throughout the 20th century. It’s a proud tradition and it’s been some of my most rewarding work, and one of the great honors of my lifetime to participate in this in Congress.
So in conclusion, I want to thank you all for having me here today. I want to thank Dan for his excellent contribution to this debate and his leadership and, again, for just the excellent work that is manifested in the book he’s recently published. Thank you for listening. Look forward to your questions. (Applause.)
Mr. Runde: I’ve waited 10 years for a speech like that. Oh, my lord. Thank you, Congressman. That was amazing. I’m moved. I’m emotionally moved. Thank you so much. That was amazing.
Rep. Gallagher: I wanted to make him cry.
Mr. Runde: You made me cry. (Laughter.)
So, Congressman, let me first start with –
Rep. Gallagher: Was it too alarmist?
Mr. Runde: No, it was perfect. Thank you so much. You spoke the truth.
I want to – we have a vote on Ukraine. So there are several fronts of the challenge. There’s Taiwan. There’s Israel. There’s Ukraine. I’ve made three trips in the last 12 months to Ukraine; I took six members of Congress two weeks ago. I consider it the most consequential thing CSIS will do. My colleague Elizabeth Hoffman, it was her idea. I was her wingman. We took eight staffers in August. Are we going to have a bill passed out of the House of Representatives in the next 72 hours on Ukraine?
Rep. Gallagher: I don’t want to jinx it, but I’m cautiously optimistic. And I have to give the speaker of the House enormous credit for moving forward, despite a lot of opposition from within the Republican Party and despite a lot of criticism. And I think we have a real chance in the next 72 hours to pass something that will be incredibly consequential for the free world. Not just assistance to Ukraine, but assistance to Taiwan and assistance to Israel. And if we get this done, it will be a big, big deal. So I just – again, I don’t want to jinx it. (Applause.) I mean, and I told the speaker, I’ll stay, you know, to make that happen.
Mr. Runde: So he’s staying over. He was going to leave – the chairman was going to leave tomorrow, but he’s staying an extra overtime to help to make sure that the vote gets done.
Rep. Gallagher: Well, I just would say – even if you’re a Democrat, the speaker, he’s moving forward. And he needs our support. This is a very difficult thing. And he’s exhausted all the other alternatives. He’s tried in good faith to get a compromise. There just are some people that do not want to compromise or accept the realities of divided government. I mean, nobody gets 100 percent of what they want, even when, you know, one party controls all three branches. When you have divided government, it’s much more difficult. So it’s going to take give and take. And I think if we’re able to get that vote on Saturday night, we will have proved the Churchill maxim, which is that America can always be counted on to do the right thing after we’ve exhausted all the other alternatives. So. (Laughter.)
Mr. Runde: Right. OK. So, Congressman, one of the things – one of the – we’ve had something like 3 million students from mainland China study in the United States. I think that’s ultimately net-net a very, very good thing. There’s been some criticism of some Chinese students studying here. China has become a great power in higher education. I hosted the Pakistani ambassador here three weeks ago. And I said – whenever I visit a developing country I ask two questions now: Where do you buy your weapons systems from? Because that matters in terms of where they – how they vote in things like the United Nations. And it’s also sort of to say, like, who your long-term partners are.
But the second is, where do you send your elites to study, is my second question. So if they say Beijing, I get nervous because I want the next finance minister of Pakistan to call Boston not Beijing, you know, after they – when they become finance minister. He told me there’s 10,000 Pakistani studying in the U.S. I said, oh, that’s great. He said, that’s not great, because we have 30,000 Pakistanis studying in China. So talk a little bit about the role of having students come here. And then, second, are you OK with having students from the – from mainland China studying in the United States?
Rep. Gallagher: Yeah. Well, I think it’s true that Xi Jinping’s daughter went to Harvard.
Mr. Runde: She did. And the foreign minister’s daughter or kid went to Yale.
Rep. Gallagher: Yeah. And I assume Xi sent his daughter to Harvard so that she could sort of really learn up close what communism means.
Mr. Runde: (Laughs.) Or how to be woke? How to be woke? Bring the woke thing back to China.
Rep. Gallagher: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just kidding. No. OK, so here’s the dilemma. Obviously, I understand – I understand the logic of, you know, students – if they study here, and they get exposed to America, you know, good things will happen. And then they’ll bring that back to China. And then we’ll just develop people-to-people ties. Like I – there’s, like, a logic to that that I accept. The challenge, as I think Alex Joske’s work has revealed quite convincingly in Australia, and it is true in the United States, is that there are a lot of PRC-affiliated researchers that are there to steal intellectual property and spy on America.
And so when we – when the previous administration instituted the PRC – the PLA-affiliated researcher ban, the challenge – it was it was directionally right. But the colleges struggled to comply with it because they don’t have, like, a counterintelligence capability, right? We can’t ask Harvard or University Wisconsin to be doing deep investigations into, OK, who’s a legitimate PRC researcher student versus who is someone who’s just spying on behalf of the government? That’s the balance we need to try and strike. And it’s an area where the FBI and our own intelligence agencies are going to have to have a productive relationship with higher education.
Mr. Runde: Right. Sorry, if it’s a 45-year-old guy who spent 20 years in the PLA and now as a mid-career grad student who wants to study AI, maybe that’s a problem, as opposed to an 18-year-old who wants to study comparative literature, right? It’s more complicated than that, but isn’t that a thing –
Rep. Gallagher: Yeah. But perhaps this is an area, as in so many areas of our economic and diplomatic and cultural issue with China, where insisting on a better measure of reciprocity would be good for our interests, right – have parity in terms of the number of students that are allowed in China, compared to the number of students that we allow here. But it’s a very, very difficult –
Mr. Runde: Yeah. My two rules are you can’t – I learned these words from my kids – you can’t narc on a fellow student. So if they want to go to an Evangelical church or they want to go to a Catholic church, they can’t be narc-ed on by their fellow students back home. That’s the first – it seems like a simple, reasonable ask. And the second stuff is just don’t steal. Don’t do soft-spying stuff.
I mean, it seems to me like those are minimum asks, and if we can come to that agreement, we’ll be fine, right? I mean, isn’t that basically the two minimal asks we’d make?
Rep. Gallagher: Yeah. I would maybe add a third, which is we’ve – one of the first things we did on the committee was go up to Columbia. And we talked to some students there, both Chinese students and Hong Kongers and Taiwanese students, about the transnational repression that they had experienced on campus, in some cases being physically assaulted by sort of pro-CCP students that were then connected to innocuous-sounding nonprofits like the Chinese Student Scholars Association that are really directing them to suppress speech that is – that is unfavorable to the regime on American campuses. So that’s an area where I think leaders of universities could step up and do more just to protect their own students.
Incidentally, I once thought that I wanted to pursue, like, an academic career, but I’ve now realized that the politics of higher education is too hard for me for that. (Laughs.)
Mr. Runde: It’s horrible. Yeah, you thought – you thought working on the Hill was hard; maybe academic politics is worse. (Laughs.)
Rep. Gallagher: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. Maybe one day.
Mr. Runde: OK. All right. So one of the things I worry about is that 20 years ago, or in the year 2000, something like 80 percent of the world’s countries, the U.S. was the number-one trading partner.
Rep. Gallagher: Yeah.
Mr. Runde: Today, China is the top trading partner for, I don’t know – I don’t know if it’s – it’s now the top trading partner for more than 120 countries. So in essence, it’s flipped. So 25 years ago, we were the number-one trading partner for dozens and dozens and dozens of countries, and that has all sorts of implications – our ability to interact with countries, et cetera. Today, that’s flipped: China’s the number-one trading partner. Should we be rethinking our trade policy, given that fact?
Rep. Gallagher: Yes. I think the fact that trade has become a four-letter word in both parties is a massive geopolitical own goal. It’s a huge gap in our overall grand strategy, particularly if you accept, as I do, that I think our economic relationship with China is going to get more competitive. Put differently, I think –
Mr. Runde: More scratchy?
Rep. Gallagher: Yeah. I think selective decoupling or robust derisking, whatever we’re calling it now, will continue, for reasons that have less to do with, like, the more hawkish consensus on Capitol Hill and calls to remove PNTR and more to do with the fact that Xi Jinping is trying to decouple from us in key areas. So if you accept that that’s going to happen, I think it puts a greater burden on us to have a proactive trade policy that breaks down economic and technological barriers certainly within the core of the free world, like our AUKUS partners, with whom we still struggle to share key technology because of outdated ITAR regulation, but also –
Mr. Runde: Sorry, what’s ITAR regulation, first?
Rep. Gallagher: International Trafficking in Arms Regulation, sort of well-intentioned legislation so that we don’t share, you know –
Mr. Runde: Don’t share some widget that can be used for weapons.
Rep. Gallagher: Yeah, to kill things, yeah.
Mr. Runde: Right? Dual use.
Rep. Gallagher: But right now we need to share things with the Aussies and the Brits, and we’re not able to. If you want to –
Mr. Runde: Or the Ukrainians.
Rep. Gallagher: Exactly. But if we – if we can’t sort of move forward on big multilateral trade agreements, at a minimum we could – we could embark on a series of bilateral agreements – a post-Brexit gold-standard agreement with the U.K., sectoral agreements with Japan, a free-trade agreement with Taiwan. We have a double-taxation agreement with Taiwan that was passed in our latest tax bill the Senate needs to pass. And then you can start doing creative regional things like a regional digital trade agreement in the Indo-Pacific. We just have to revitalize that proactive trade agenda, particularly in order to combat the costs of a more competitive economic relationship with the PRC.
Mr. Runde: We have – there’s something called the African Growth and Opportunity Act. It’s called AGOA. It’s a trade-preferences act. It ends October 1 of 2025. We’ve done about eight events around this issue. I’m driven to put energy into this issue because I think it’s part of a – I mean, we need to have a different kind of a partnership with Africa. There’s several hundred million middle class in Africa. There’s more cellphones in Africa than in the United States and Europe combined. I believe that’s statistically true; someone can fact-check me on that. We need a different kind of a partnership. I think AGOA’s a vector for that. And there – but at the same time, when we put AGOA into place 25 years ago the world was a different place, Africa was a different place, our relationship with Africa was different. It seems to me that the kinds of things you’re talking about could also be included as we think about a new AGOA, which will have to be dealt with over sort of the next 12 months.
Rep. Gallagher: Yeah.
Mr. Runde: So – and I think, for example, a lot of the – there are a number of critical minerals in Africa and a number of countries would want to perhaps, you know, have some kind of a different kind of a relationship on that, so.
Rep. Gallagher: Yeah. I wonder if there’s something upstream of all that, too, which is I think we have, like, a dearth of expertise in these areas. I mean, I know you’re an expert, but it’s –
Mr. Runde: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Rep. Gallagher: Like, I was part of a generation of, like, budding national security professionals who all rushed to learn Arabic and focus on the Middle East because that was sort of the shiny object, right? And I think there’s something similar happening right now with respect to China, I would imagine. But when it comes to all these countries that are critical, particularly in the Global South but even just in China’s neighborhood, right, I still don’t think we have requisite deep regional –
Mr. Runde: How many people know anything about Central Asia?
Rep. Gallagher: Yeah, or Indonesia, or even the Philippines.
Mr. Runde: Or the Pacific – or the Pacific Islands, right?
Rep. Gallagher: Yeah, yeah, I mean, which is absolutely critical. And so finding a way both in the think-tank community, but also in the way we develop careers in the military and the intelligence community to develop that deep regional expertise in areas that tend to get overlooked I think is connected to that, if not upstream.
Mr. Runde: I hundred percent agree. I’d say much of my work here – and I can’t do this all by myself – has been to try and focus on overlooked countries in the Global South because I think that’s one of the critical theaters in great-power competition.
Rep. Gallagher: Totally.
Mr. Runde: So I agree with you.
Let’s talk about ports. There’s been lots of research at think tanks like ours saying, like, there’s a lot of ports being taken over by the Chinese Communist Party. That’s great in terms of analyzing that there’s a problem; what the hell do we do about it, I think, is a different problem. So how should we think about the fact that, you know, they’re able to – you made some remarks about this from your formal remarks, but how should we think about things like ports?
Rep. Gallagher: Yeah. Well, I do think shining a light on the scale and scope of the problem is step one. I think it’s something like 80 percent of the world’s ports are now controlled by Chinese companies. ZPMC controls 90 percent of the world’s smart cranes, including in our own ports – in, like, the ports of Miami and things like that. Incidentally, I went down there with one of our committee members, Carlos Gimenez, and had to climb up into one of those smart cranes. And I realized I was afraid of heights, which I didn’t know before. (Laughter.) But when it comes to how do you – how do you do something about it, I don’t have a silver bullet solution.
Mr. Runde: I don’t either.
Rep. Gallagher: I thought, well, you’re the expert.
Mr. Runde: Yeah, I’m supposed to – yeah, I’m supposed to think some deep thoughts and come back with a clever answer.
Rep. Gallagher: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. (Laughs.)
Mr. Runde: I don’t know what the hell do we do about this. But we did a session on this earlier this week. And I said to this group, like, what the hell do we do about this? And we talked about, like, it’s a problem. But I think we kind of had like a collective, you know, kind of like Montessori meeting that didn’t fully kind of come up with an answer. So I think that’s – more research needed, right? And it’s an employment program for people at think tanks like mine, right?
Rep. Gallagher: We have – we have some related recommendations in the report we put out at the end of last year on economic and technological competition of the CCP. Which is a bipartisan report. If you kind of look more broadly, we talk about reforming and modernizing DFC and Ex-Im to make it more strategic, to make it more risk acceptant, particularly when it comes to countering BRI. We recently did fund the State Department’s Countering PRC Influence shop in the last omnibus bill. Which was a good thing. And I think there’s more, as you know better than anybody, we could do to develop good governance in the Global South, so that they’re able to invest, and their investments align with ours.
Mr. Runde: Yeah. I know I’m going to get the hook in a second, but the – one of our allies came to the U.S. government about a year ago and said, hey, there are these – there is this undersea cable in the South Pacific. You guys for sure – you’re an AID – you, for sure, have, like, this safe in the wall. Could you just, like, open the safe? We need, like, 100 million bucks, like, right now. And could you just, like, build an undersea cable? Because, like, otherwise the Chinese are going to build this between two islands I can’t find on a map, Chairman.
So there’s a series of challenges like that, that aren’t kind of – like, our current toolkit isn’t prepared for. Because, like, there’s not a safe in the USAID administrator’s office, like, oh, yes, I’ve got $100 million right here. I’ll just – we’ll just Western Union it, or whatever you do these days, Venmo, or whatever the hell you do. And say we’ll just Venmo it and we’ll just build another undersea cable between two islands I can’t pronounce the names of and can’t find on the map, but it’s super-duper important.
So I think whether it’s ports and smart cranes, I didn’t know what the hell a smart crane was until 20 minutes ago, and then – or these undersea cables, we’ve got a whole series of challenges because the Chinese Communist Party is a near peer soft power competitor. And if we leave voids they will fill it, especially in the Global South. So we’re going to have to, like, relook at our toolkit and say, like, well, we got to update some things or do some things. How do we work with our allies, the Five Eyes or others? And then also how do we bring in the private sector? A lot of things you were talking about, but – right?
Rep. Gallagher: Yeah. I think about it. So Matt Pottinger and I recently wrote an article in Foreign Affairs kind of laying out our – what we thought was a fair critique of the Biden administration’s approach on China, and then kind of an alternative strategy, which we sort of lump under this banner of rearm, reduce, recruit. Obviously prioritizing hard power in order to deter a CCP invasion of Taiwan. Reducing our economic dependency in key areas on China. But then recruiting other partners and allies into our framework. And I think about it in my own head as, like, a series of concentric circles.
As I alluded to before, the beating heart of the free world is probably AUKUS and Five Eyes, right? Those are the allies with whom we share the most in terms of values and other things – and secrets. But then you kind of extend the concentric circle out to Japan, NATO countries, and then you got to really start expanding it even further and constantly be with countries that don’t fit neatly into those categories, whether it’s Vietnam, whether it’s Thailand, I mean, take your pick. Just trying to find ways to work more closely with them and get them to Finlandize in our direction, to use an old Cold War term.
Mr. Runde: So in my book, I have, like, three bumper stickers. And one of my bumper stickers is we need a positive forward-looking agenda for countries in the Global South, that speak to their hopes and aspirations. And if we don’t do that properly, they’re going to take their business to the Chinese Communist Party.
Rep. Gallagher: Yeah. Could I add one thing? I guess again, in respect for, you know, sometimes, like, congressional delegations get a lot of criticism because, you know, the members will go and, you know, they’ll spend a week in New Zealand with their spouses on the –
Mr. Runde: And drink champagne or something.
Rep. Gallagher: Exactly. But done right, that type of diplomacy – and it is that – can have a big impact. And nobody did it better, at least that I’ve seen, than John McCain.
Mr. Runde: Totally.
Rep. Gallagher: He was kind enough to take me to Halifax when I was a member elect. I wasn’t even a real member. I remember this because he kept calling Adam Kinzinger, Kissinger, which I thought was funny. (Laughter.) But just to see the seriousness with which he would approach these bilateral meetings with foreign ministers in all sorts of countries – big, medium, small – and just the op tempo he had at these events, and the reaction he got from those countries, and how big of a deal it was to meet with a congressional delegation led by John McCain. I mean, I don’t know, obviously you just got to be there. You got to stay engaged. You got to develop those relationships. That is, like, what the free world is right? It’s just these sinews of relationships that we have to keep reifying over and over.
Mr. Runde: I really miss him. And I took my oldest son to the state funeral for John McCain. He just – it’s such a void.
So, Chairman, we’re going to miss you on Capitol Hill. I understand you have to – you need to make this decision. But please don’t make this be your last public act, if you will, please. We need to in public life. Please thank my friend, Chairman, Mike Gallagher, for being with us today.
Rep. Gallagher: Thank you all. Appreciate it. (Applause.) Thanks, Dan. Thanks, Dan. That was fun, yeah. Appreciate it, yeah.
Mr. Runde: Thank you.
Rep. Gallagher: Great. Thank you. (Applause.)

49,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/middle-east-risks-and-oil-market,Unknown,"April 11, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS podcast published on April 10, 2024. Listen to the podcast here.
Jon Alterman: The Iranians are always a bit of a wild card when it comes to regional affairs. But the Iranians like unpredictability, oil markets don't like unpredictability.
Ben Cahill: Thanks for joining us on the Energy 360 Podcast. I'm Ben Cahill, senior fellow in the Energy Security and Climate Change Program at CSIS. On April 4th, brent crude oil prices rose above $90 a barrel for the first time since October, and there's suddenly a lot of speculation about a hundred-dollar oil. Geopolitical risk is a big part of the equation. Oil market fundamentals have shifted in recent months with strong oil demand in the first quarter, extended production cuts by OPEC+ through the middle of the year, and expectations that shale growth in the United States will finally slow. All this suggests a tighter market by midyear. OPEC still has a lot of spare capacity, but in this type of market, geopolitical risks start to resonate and that's what's happening now On April 1st, an Israeli airstrike on part of Iran's embassy compound in Syria killed seven senior military officers, and the expectation is that Iran will have to respond in some way. These tensions add to a fraught climate in the region with the terrible violence in Gaza still unfolding and Houthi attacks on Red Sea vessels disrupting global shipping. So, to talk about these events in the Middle East, I'm really happy to be joined by my colleague Dr. Jon Alderman. Jon is Senior Vice President and Brezinski Chair and Global Security and Geostrategy at CSIS. He's also the director of the Middle East Program. 
Jon, welcome to 360. Thanks for being with us.
Jon Alterman: It's good to be with you Ben.
Ben Cahill: So, lots to talk about, but I thought maybe we could first talk about the significance of this airstrike on that Iranian embassy compound in Syria. Just explain why that is significant and what happened.
Jon Alterman: Israeli jets seem to have had very good intelligence and very good capability to target a meeting of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commanders who have been involved in Gaza. They seem to have waited until diplomatic personnel had left what was described as a consular building, so only military officers were killed. That suggests pretty good intelligence, thick capacity to, of course, penetrate Syrian air defenses. To destroy a target like that suggests the Israelis have pretty good capability. The Iranians I think are going to feel a need to respond. Not so much to dissuade these Israelis, but to encourage their allies to say, we have your back. We're not just going to take this lying down. I think from the perspective of a country that has been building up what they describe as an axis of resistance in the Middle East, you can't take a hit like that and not react.
But I think at the same time, the Iranians are very cautious about getting into an escalatory spiral with Israel that they think they might lose. The Iranians have been investing billions and billions of dollars in Hezbollah in Lebanon. They have been investing in Iraq and elsewhere in the region. The challenge of Lebanon for both the Iranians and the Israelis is that an escalation in Lebanon could get very violent for both sides cause a lot of destruction. Hezbollah and Lebanon have probably about 150,000 rockets and missiles. They can cover all of Israel. Israel could flatten all of Southern Lebanon, which is the base for Hezbollah, which as I said, Iran has put billions of dollars into over many years. My sense is that neither one wants to have the big war. Now Israel feels it might need to demonstrate a willingness to do that. Hezbollah may feel a willingness to show that it's not defenseless. You could miscalculate your way into war. It doesn't feel to me like either side wants the calculate its way into war, but there is that very real possibility and there's been more violence over the Israeli Lebanese border in the last week than there's been quite some time.
Ben Cahill: And I think we also have seen in the past that Iran doesn't necessarily lash out and respond right away when events like this happen. It's got lots of assets that its disposal, that it can sort of work overtime and also limited capabilities.
Jon Alterman: Over time and also limited capabilities. I mean, it's a combination of it has lots of options. It doesn't have any great options. It certainly doesn't have as many options as the Israelis do. So, it's partly when they think they'll have an opportunity when they think they can do something that won't provoke an escalation with Israel. The Iranians love to do what a former CIA operative once described to me as attributable, but deniable operations, what Karim Sadjadpour at the Carnegie Endowment calls implausible deniability. I think the Iranians want something that has some fingerprints but doesn't get them into a rapid escalation because they don't really have many options when it comes to a rapid escalation. Certainly, they don't have as many direct and punishing options as either Israel or the United States.
Ben Cahill: So, in some ways it's about putting a weak hand well and again.
Jon Alterman: Again, and they played a weak hand well. I mean if you think about it, President Raisi came in in August 2021. He said, we're not going to keep chasing the United States and its allies. We're going to build closer ties to China and the rest of Asia. We will improve our regional ties. We will build this axis of resistance. And I would argue that from an Iranian perspective, that's gone very well. They have shifted the momentum. They have not only built ties with China, but they've very much strengthened their ties with Russia. They have protection security council. They are seeing increasing hostility to the United States presence in the Middle East. Israel is more isolated. Israel's efforts at regional integration are halted if not reversed from an Iranian perspective. If you assume that there's no good story out there and you're going to have to be fighting for your survival and there's going to be tension and conflict. I think the Iranian analysis is we have done quite well. We have our instruments of deterrence, and we are in a better position to bargain now than we were a year ago, and that's all they want.
Ben Cahill: Yeah, that's really interesting. You mentioned, I want to get into some details, maybe about some potential actions or retaliation. So, you mentioned Hezbollah's rocket arsenal in Southern Lebanon. We've also seen in the past that with plausible deniability there could be attacks on tankers and sabotage. There could be strikes against U.S. assets or even troops and places like Iraq and Syria. Can you talk a little bit in more detail about what else might fit the Iranian calculus here and what we might expect if we are trapped in sort of a bit of an escalatory spiral here?
Jon Alterman: So, as you say, the Iranians are deeply into Iraq and Syria where you have U.S. troops, they have a window into Israel, which is one of the principle reasons they built up Hezbollah in the first place. There are all sorts of soft targets around the world. Israeli targets, Jewish targets that you can imagine the Iranians might seek to attack. I think they would be reluctant to go after an American target just because the U.S. has the ability to project for so effectively into the Gulf in a way that Israel really doesn't. It's a little bit far away for Israeli jets to reach. It's not far away because the U.S. both have bases in the region and has aircraft carriers to run things off of. So, I think the Iranians are unlikely to attack the United States. Of course, the United States put out a statement right after the attack in Damascus saying, we didn't know about it in advance.
We didn't approve it. This isn't us. So, I don't think you're going to see the Iranians doing something bold against the United States. There will be something to signal to the Israelis, but as I said to their allies especially, we're not just going to take this long down, but given that everything is from an Iranian perspective, given that everything is moving their way, I don't think this is the time they want to risk a reversal. This is a time when they want to mark up a draw, say we've responded and continue to win the larger game that from an Iranian perspective, they're continuing to win.
Ben Cahill: So, along those lines, I know you have a new essay out in Foreign Affairs. It's called A Détente Option for Iran, and as I understand that's about Iranian behavior in the region and maybe some misperceptions about what the U.S. should do in response of what's effective. So just talk to us about what that essay is about. 
Jon Alterman: There's an assumption in the United States that if the U.S. just applied enough pressure to the Iranians that the Iranians would behave. And it's a combination of U.S. effort and signaling the U.S. willingness to exert force that you reach a tipping point, and the Iranians will be on good behavior. People often talk about that as a way to deter Iran. I don't think that's the way it works. I think the Iranians, first of all, that's not the way deterrence works, but the Iranians are not, it's not a question of getting the Iranians to continue not to do things, which is what deterrence is. It's a way to get the Iranians to be more selective in what they do. And the Iranians continue to act across a very wide variety of fronts using a very wide variety of instruments. They're constantly testing, exploring, probing. What I argue is that we have to first be a little clearer about what we actually care about because you can't control all of this Iranian behavior offensive as we find a lot of it to be.
Second, we should be a little less predictable. Don't let them probe and figure out where the red lines are. Let them worry about where the red lines are. A little more uncertainty I think would inhibit Iranian action. The third part, which may be counterintuitive, but the Iranians have to believe that better behavior will result in better circumstances for them. And if they think that the United States is only going to be turning the screws, turning the screws, turning the screws a one-way ratchet as people sometimes describe it, then there's no actual cost to bad behavior because you get the results regardless. And I think that a degree of assurance, not that you can solve the tensions with Iran because I think it's going to be a very long time until we can resolve U.S. tensions with Iran, but some Iranian sense that there's a relationship between how they act and how the United States acts toward Iran would actually encourage better behavior as long as we accept it's not going to be very good behavior for quite some time.
Ben Cahill: And that perspective is important this year. I think because it's an election year, there's obviously a lot of concerns about events in the Middle East. There are concerns about the energy markets and the oil price. There are some broad incentives for the United States to maybe engage a little bit, create some understanding of what more constructive understanding would be and some of the rewards for stopping some of these provocations and instead changing behavior. A bit like some signaling from Washington could help in that regard I imagine.
Jon Alterman: But of course, there's no political constituency in the United States for loosening pressure on Iran. From an Iranian government perspective, Rouhani tried to improve bilateral relations and ended up with the Trump administration's maximum from pressure campaign. That being said, I've spoken to some Iranian academics who get very enthusiastic about the possibility that a new Trump administration would feature a president who is attracted by the idea of negotiating face-to-face. And this could potentially provide an option whether we get to a Trump administration, whether we get to a negotiation, I don't know. But I think it's important to note that the Iranians don't seem to me to be especially scared of return to the Trump administration. And you could argue that from an Iranian perspective, the most important thing is not to have a world united against Iran. And you could argue that a Trump administration almost guarantees the world won't be united against Iran. And you could say that advances Iran's interest. Again, I think the important baseline is the Iranians don't assume that everybody's going to get along. If your premise is you're going to have to fight for your survival and fight against isolation and use all sorts of asymmetrical tools against stronger powers just for survival, if that's your baseline, that gives you a very different pattern of behavior than what the United States is constantly striving for, which is can't we all just get along and deploy our troops to where it really matters in East Asia and move on.
Ben Cahill: And you've already talked about the Iranian relationship with China and Russia in that regard, which is important. The other thing you note in the article, which I also think is important is sanctions are dere for Iran right now. They've become accustomed to it. They've built up this resistance economy. And so, from a political economy perspective, they've adapted. Right? And there are a lot of reasons for the leadership in Iran to actually shrug all these things off and say, look, we've adjusted. The United States is doing everything we can. It's throwing everything at us, and we've resisted all this economic pressure, and we still have friends and options, right?
Jon Alterman: Partly because they run the smuggling networks that circumvent the sanctions and they make a lot of money through that, partly because it gives them an excuse for their economic performance. They say, well, it's under sanctions. This is because we're fighting a war with the United States. I think one thing that Americans consistently get wrong is we assume that when we put the screws to an authoritarian government that the people will be on our side. I think we misunderstand in many cases; even bad governments can play a nationalist card much more effectively than a foreign power like the United States. People rally around their own besieged, ineffective bad government rather than rally around a foreign power that's trying to displace their bad government. We don't quite get that. I think we still have this image, and we saw it in the Iraq war in 2003 that we assumed that the Iraqis would be welcoming us with flowers and candy after a horribly repressive regime and anti-Americanism in Iraq quickly became very much a thing. And I think we sort of assume that people see our positive intentions, but even bad governments are often very effective at undermining that.
Ben Cahill: So let's broaden the aperture a little bit. I want to talk about how events in the region have unfolded since October. I wonder if you could just talk about the mood in the region since the Gaza War, and I'm especially interested in how it's changed some of these shifts that we've seen in recent years, right? We had a United States trying to disengage from Middle East Wars, we had the Abraham Accords. We've had some interesting, I wouldn't say reconciliation, but more of a normalization between Iran and Saudi Arabia and Iran and the UAE. The Gaza War seems to have scrambled a lot of these things and across the region there seems to be an incredible resentment towards the deaths that we're seeing in Gaza, a huge amount of anger towards Israel and the United States. It's a very fraught climate. So these latest events are part of it, but things have been brewing for some time. It's a macro question, but can you just give people a sense of how the events of the past six months have really shaken things up and how this latest kind of series of events between Israel and Iran add to that?
Jon Alterman: What I keep hearing from people is an incredulity that the United States talks about international law. The United States talks about the in viability of borders. The United States talks about a global order and in the view of people in the region partly who are watching Al Jazeera, partly who are following social media, they say Israel is violating all of those principles, not only with impunity from the United States, but with support from the United States. They think that for a United States that talks about the rule of law and global order, it's absolutely inexplicable that the United States should turn a complete blind eye while with a straight face and at the same time encouraging the world to align against Russia and support Ukraine. And from a regional perspective, when you combine this with a sense that the United States was interested in pulling up stakes in the region and abandoning the region to Iranian depredations and focusing instead on the Western Pacific, it's a region where the population says, we don't have a future with the United States.
Why would we want a future with the United States? And governments are different. Governments feel that the United States has an enduring role, and I think people often overlook the fact that all the diplomacy about the resolution of the war and Gaza centers around the United States, Russia is completely absent. China is completely absent. The diplomacy is U.S. led diplomacy, and you couldn't like it or not like it, or you can say it's effective or not effective. But the fact is all the serious talks about getting a ceasefire and getting hostages released from Gaza, have the CIA director Bill Burns in the middle of them, you have Secretary of State, Tony Blinken repeatedly going out to the region. It's what President Biden says that matters with the Israelis. So it seems to me that from a governmental level, there's some frustration but also a recognition of the fact that there is no power or collection of powers that can do what the United States can do.
There's deep frustration. The U.S. isn't doing more. There's deep frustration. The U.S. is enacting differently, but the United States has a future in the region that I think governments recognize on a popular level, approval of the United States is in the low single digits. Somebody told me in Jordan, it's polling around 1% approval. I think that's within the margin of error. And if you look at some of the images and some of the discussion about it, you start to understand why it's there. I think the other interesting piece is that the humanitarian part of Gaza is entirely absent from the Israeli narrative. If you look at the Hebrew language press, not the international Israeli press, but the Hebrew language press, there's almost nothing about the humanitarian situation in Gaza. If you look at polling of Arab opinion, Palestinian opinion, nine out of 10 Palestinians don't think that the Hamas committed atrocities on October 7th, and you still have 70% or more of Palestinians who argue that arm struggle has to be the way forward.
So you can look at public opinion in lots of ways, and I think almost all the findings will make you depressed. We have a long way to go, but in terms of the mood in the region, the mood in the region is bad. The other sort of asterisk to that is that there's some frustration in the Gulf that they are doing economic diversification. They're doing all sorts of interesting and important things regarding the energy transition, as you know, and nobody's paying attention because everybody's attention is sucked up by Gaza. And there's a certain degree of frustration that first the Saudis were hosting the G20, but it got hit by Covid and had to be remote, and now they're doing all these other things after COP in the UAE and elsewhere and everybody's absorbed with Gaza and they say, well, when are people going to pay attention to our very important economic transition issues? Again, I think that's sort of a government concern, but the popular mood is just absolutely poisonous and absolutely poisonous toward the United States, which they say talks about values and then given an opportunity to apply those values has absolutely no interest in lifting a finger.
Ben Cahill: Yeah, I'm glad you've discussed all this. I do think that a lot of people in Washington don't understand how much perceptions of the United States have been harmed, deeply harmed by the events of the last couple months. And of course, this is part of a longer trend in concerns about us relative disengagement from the region, but it's really significant that it's changed so dramatically in the last couple months. So, to bring this back to energy markets to close out, I mean the oil market, despite all the events in the region, it's been fairly subdued since October. The impact, I think the market has shrugged off this risk of an escalatory spiral in a wider regional ward, withdrawn on Hezbollah and other factors. Something about the market response to geopolitical risks seems to have changed. The market just doesn't respond to these things the way that it used to.
I've been puzzling through why that is the rise of quantitative trading in the market, just like a generational shift and among traders, I think a lot of it has to do with satellite data and surveillance and knowing almost in real time what is actually happening and shrugging off supply risks until they materialize. But the market has shifted a little bit, but now traders and policymakers are really wondering about how well they can predict what's going to happen next and how much this conflict might spread. So, I guess my final question for you is how can governments in the region contain this? And you've written in the past about governments getting together to solve their problems. Of course, the U.S. is still kind of an indispensable factor in the region as you discussed here, but there was a sense that the region was trying to come together and contain this conflict and prevent it from spreading and getting worse. Is there something to be optimistic about in terms of not letting this get out of control?
Jon Alterman: I think governments don't want it to get out of control. The Iranians are always a bit of a wild card when it comes to regional affairs. I think the Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping, which I don't think the Iranians control, but I think they often cheer quietly. They seem to have a surveillance ship that's in the Gulf of Aiden. It's helping things along. But the Iranians like unpredictability, oil markets don't like unpredictability. I have never thought there's a high likelihood of a real explosion. There's a sustained possibility of a real explosion, but I don't think there's a high likelihood of it. And there are two ways to get into a war. One is you escalate intentionally, and the other is you escalate unintentionally. Israelis are convinced that they need to respond disproportionately in order to deter their adversaries. That could get you into an escalatory spiral pretty quickly.
But again, I think nobody wants to go there. I don't think there are a lot of tools that Iran has through proxies, through drones, through other kinds of things. I think the Israelis probably are pretty happy with what they were able to pull off and might be willing to accept an Iranian response that they think is not consequential. I think the Iranians are mostly wanting to signal to their own people and don't need to signal to the Israelis. So, I could see a way for us to get to an off ramp just the way after Iranian proxies attacked the U.S. based Tower 22 in Northern Jordan. After U.S. response to that, the Iranians didn't attack any U.S. and their proxies didn't attack U.S. forces for more than a month. So, I think one of the challenges we have thinking about the region is one of our premises is everybody who is hostile to us must be irrational because when you're looking at the United States, what's not to love, and I think that we have in the Middle East a lot of rational hostile actors.
I think they're interested in probing; they're interested in exploring, despite the fact they talk about martyrdom seeking operations. They're not really interested in martyrdom. And my guess would be that there's a much better than even chance that we're able to navigate our way out of this. That being said, you have to worry about low probability, high impact events, and the Middle East for many months to come is going to give us the possibility of low probability, high impact events, the Israeli assault on the convoy containing World Central Kitchen workers, I think is an example that one night's events can change everything. I think you're starting to see it in the U.S. attitude toward support for the government of Israel in this war. I could imagine we wake up one morning and we're in a different place, not likely, but the longer this goes on, the longer their attentions, the more likely cumulatively it is that we get into that position.
Ben Cahill: Well, the mood is definitely shifting in the region. The mood is shifting in the oil market. So Jon, I'm really grateful that you could join us today and help us make sense of these events. I encourage everyone to read Jon's piece in Foreign Affairs. We will add a link in our show notes. So Jon, thank you for joining us and thanks to everyone for listening.
Jon Alterman: Thank you, Ben.

50,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/islamic-state-khorasan-province-exploiting-counterterrorism-gap,Tricia Bacon,"April 11, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"Last month, after four gunmen attacked Crocus City Hall in Moscow, killing more than 150 people, all eyes turned to the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP), the Islamic State’s so-called province based in Afghanistan. Soon thereafter, the Islamic State core claimed responsibility for the attack while ISKP heralded it without directly claiming it. Despite this ambiguity, ISKP has emerged as the most likely culprit. Unfortunately, the attack in Moscow not only represents an expansion in the group’s transnational capability, but it also highlights the difficulties countering the organization.
In an international environment replete with conflict and competition, ISKP should, in theory, be a rare opportunity for international counterterrorism cooperation. With transnational membership and ambitions, ISKP is a threat to all governments in the region, including the Taliban regime, Pakistan, Iran, Central Asian states, and India. Most of its attacks since its emergence in 2015 have been in Afghanistan and, to a lesser extent, in Pakistan, but the group—as well as/along with Islamic State core—has also conducted multiple attacks in Iran in recent years. To date, it has only launched small-scale attacks in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, but it encourages violence there as well as in India. It is also an international threat. It has been behind multiple plots in Europe, and it seeks to develop the capability to strike in the United States as well as attack the United States’ strategic competitors, both China and Russia.
Though it is easy to dismiss Moscow’s false claims that the West and Ukraine supported the attack in Moscow last month, Russian president Vladmir Putin’s response reflects a broader problem with counterterrorism efforts against the group. Counterterrorism, particularly against the Islamic State, was once an area of cooperation even between countries with broader tensions. There was even a Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. But in the current environment, governments increasingly view terrorist threats, particularly the threat from ISKP, through the lens of conspiracies and competition, rather than as a common problem.
ISKP is a wholly rejectionist group, meaning that it opposes all the governments in the region as well as the major powers allied with them. This stance is an anomaly in South Asia where most militant groups benefit from at least one government backer. Instigating so many enemies at the same time should be a losing strategy; it certainly was for the Islamic State core in Iraq and Syria. But there has not been such cooperation against ISKP. Instead, it has exploited three counterterrorism gaps to plot and conduct attacks in Afghanistan, the broader region, and beyond.
Conspiracies over Reality
First, ISKP benefits from governments’ tendency to misdiagnose the group. Instead of seeing ISKP as an organization that has embraced the Islamic State’s goal of overthrowing the current international order, many threatened governments see ISKP through the lens of their existing adversaries and rivals. Moscow fell prey to this fallacy, first by ignoring the U.S. warning of an impending operation and then by accusing the West and Ukraine of having a role in the attack.
But such unfounded conspiratorial analysis of ISKP is also common among the regional governments most threatened by the group. The Taliban and the Iranian government have both portrayed ISKP as a client of the United States. In India, ISKP is regularly dismissed as yet another proxy for Pakistan, while Pakistan sees an Indian hand behind the group. Unfortunately, the track record of government support for militant groups in the region has contributed to the erroneous tendency to see ISKP through this lens. 
These misdiagnoses have consequences. They can contribute to regional tensions and poorly conceived responses to ISKP attacks. For example, after ISKP struck Iran earlier this year, Tehran responded by launching missiles into Pakistan’s restive Balochistan province. Confusingly, Tehran claimed it was targeting Jaish al-Adl, a Sunni militant group that operates in Balochistan unrelated to ISKP. Pakistan responded with its own strike on Iran, though fortunately the two countries de-escalated tensions soon thereafter. 
Conspiracies about ISKP skew governments’ assessment of the threat, causing them to ignore warnings—as occurred before the attack in Iran in January and the attack in Moscow last month—and they also inhibit broader cooperation, as governments are unlikely to cooperate with others they believe are sponsoring the group.
The Limitations of the Taliban’s Counterterrorism Efforts
In the absence of international cooperation, the task of countering ISKP has largely fallen to the Afghan Taliban, which raises a second limitation. The Taliban rightly sees ISKP as a threat to its regime. Indeed, ISKP has long dedicated most of its ire toward the Taliban, despite its international objectives. After taking over Afghanistan, the Taliban regime initially adopted a heavy-handed approach to countering the group, which included crackdowns on Salafist communities. More recently, the Taliban has had some successes in targeting ISKP operatives, including killing a senior operative who was responsible for the group’s attacks in Kabul, conducting raids, and reportedly infiltrating the group.
But ISKP has given as good as it got. Its operations in Afghanistan reached an all-time high as the Taliban took over, and it maintained a higher tempo for an unusually long time. Though the group’s attacks in Afghanistan have been limited since late 2022, concluding that the group has been seriously weakened based on those trends is premature. ISKP has had an erratic attack pattern with sharp peaks and low valleys since its inception in 2015 (see Figure 1). It conducts waves of attacks that draw counterterrorism pressure, and then it temporarily launches fewer operations as it adapts to the pressure and losses. With over 3,000 members, it has ranged from an organization that held territory to a network of covert cells depending on the environment, but it has consistently posed a threat irrespective of its structure. Though it takes the group time to regenerate attack capability after losses, ISKP has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to do so, including under pressure from the United States. Not only is the decline in attacks in Afghanistan likely only temporary, but it has corresponded with a slight uptick in violence in Pakistan (see Figures 2 and 3). The Islamic State boasts a province in Pakistan as well as Afghanistan, but it is unclear whether there are actually two distinct entities operating in the region. More likely, there is a connected network that ISKP has used to conduct its transnational operations and attacks in Pakistan while it adapts to the pressure in Afghanistan.  In addition, the quantity of attacks in Afghanistan is not the best measure of ISKP’s threat. It has repeatedly hit targets that undermine the Taliban’s claims to be able to provide security for Afghans and foreign officials. In the two and a half years since the Taliban’s takeover, ISKP has succeeded in assassinating Taliban figures, striking multipleinternational targets in secure locations in Kabul, targeting Shia in the capital and other major cities, and even recently conducting an attack that penetrated the Taliban’s de facto capital of Kandahar.
Not only have ISKP’s attacks pierced the Taliban’s claims to be able to provide security, but they have undermined the Taliban’s ability to uphold its pledge in the Doha Accord to prevent its territory from being used to launch attacks on other countries. The inclusion of that clause was intended to pressure the Taliban to restrain its longtime foreign jihadist allies operating in Afghanistan. But those groups have not been the main threat emanating from Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover, except in Pakistan.
With a multinational composition that includes Afghans, Pakistanis, Central Asians, Uyghurs, and others, ISKP has long sought to engage in more transnational plotting. But it has only been able to fully realize those ambitions since the Taliban takeover. Even though the Taliban has allegedly infiltrated ISKP, it has proven unable to prevent ISKP from conducting external attacks. Instead, ISKP puts pressure on the Taliban by offering an alternative to disgruntled foreign jihadists who are frustrated by the limitations the Taliban has placed on their activities or its warm relations with multiple governments they oppose, like Russia or China. Such operatives can help ISKP develop its international reach.
The Taliban’s counterterrorism capability is unlikely to improve in ways that will weaken ISKP over the long term. Though the Taliban has received de facto recognition from numerous countries, including Russia, India, China, and many Gulf states, that acceptance has not come with counterterrorism assistance. India, China, and Russia, in particular, have engaged with the Taliban in part to encourage the Taliban to prevent threats to their countries, but they have not provided aid that would bolster the Taliban’s counterterrorism capability.
Moreover, the Taliban’s tensions with the Pakistani government have complicated efforts against ISKP. The Taliban has allowed the anti-Pakistani group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) use its territory to target Pakistan. The freedom of movement afforded to the TTP also allows ISKP to shift across the Durand Line to evade Taliban detection as well as conduct attacks in Pakistan.
The Limitations of the Current International Environment
Finally, counterterrorism efforts against ISKP are hindered by the broader international environment. The international appetite for counterterrorism cooperation diminished with the rise of strategic competition and as a result of the major conflicts that have broken out in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
Though ISKP is a threat to numerous governments, it is not the top priority for any. For example, Pakistan is consumed with its political and economic crisis and a growing threat from the TTP and Baloch separatist groups. Iran is focused on the war in Gaza and managing its client groups’ responses to that conflict. Though ISKP regularly threatens India, it has not been able to attack there yet, so India’s efforts against the organization are limited to disrupting plotsat home. Even the Taliban’s efforts against ISKP have waxed and waned during its rule as it grapples with governing the desperately poor country.
For its part, the United States has limited interest in counterterrorism action in Afghanistan since its withdrawal, though it has maintained some intelligence collection capabilities. Though the United States had sufficient intelligence to warn Iran and Russia of pending ISKP threats, both countries claimed—dubiously in the case of the intelligence shared with Russia—that the intelligence was not actionable. And the United States has not used its “over-the-horizon” counterterrorism capability against ISKP or even used it at all in Afghanistan since it killed Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kabul in 2022.
Unfortunately, these three limitations to counterterrorism efforts are unlikely to change. Governments will likely continue to misdiagnose ISKP as the product of their rivals. They will thus be hesitant to cooperate with one another and even heed warnings. The Taliban’s counterterrorism capability is unlikely to improve or be sufficient to weaken ISKP over the long term. And other priorities and conflicts will continue to overshadow ISKP.
Meanwhile, the threat from ISKP will persist. It will maintain its transnational network and ability to inspire plots. It will keep its foothold in South Asia. The group sets itself apart in the crowded militant landscape in the region with its willingness to target indiscriminately, even attacking girls at school and a maternity ward. And it has consistently been able to adapt to pressure and re-emerge as a threat. In its current state, despite some setbacks in Afghanistan, ISKP remains one of the Islamic State’s largest and most dangerous affiliates. But conventional measures of strength do not fully capture the threat from the group. Its ability to adapt, its willingness to target indiscriminately, and its transnational ambitions make it a threat beyond its size and well beyond Afghanistan.

51,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/oil-market-risks-start-resonate,Ben Cahill and Raad Alkadiri,"April 10, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"Since the Hamas attacks on Israeli citizens on October 7, the oil market has seemingly shrugged off escalation risks. Despite the brutal assault on Gaza that has killed an estimated 33,000 Palestinians, disruptions to shipping lanes due to frequent attacks on Red Sea vessels by Houthi militants, and low-level conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the market response has been muted. This is largely because disruptions to physical supplies of crude oil and product products have not materialized. Instead, macroeconomic concerns have continued to drive sentiment in an oil market that has remained well supplied, with production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers (OPEC+) last year offset by supply growth elsewhere.
Recent price increases suggest that market sentiment is changing, with Brent crude oil climbing above $90 per barrel in early April. With traders now anticipating tighter crude and product fundamentals for the rest of the year, markets are now more sensitive to the risk of potential geopolitical disruptions to supply. The possibility of a direct confrontation between Israel and Iran that could disrupt flows in the Persian Gulf looms especially large. An overt Iranian retaliation for the recent Israeli airstrike in Syria that killed a senior Islamic Republican Guard Corps commander could ratchet up prices toward $100 per barrel.
Signal, Not Just Noise
Market fundamentals should continue to underpin higher oil prices through the remainder of the year. Oil demand growth in the first quarter was relatively strong, including U.S. transportation demand, and the International Energy Agency (IEA) recently upgraded its first quarter demand growth figure to 1.7 million barrels per day (b/d). The agency has raised its 2024 demand forecast to 1.3 million b/d—far lower than last year’s 2.3 million b/d, but still strong by historical standards. Asia will be the key engine of growth. China’s demand growth is widely expected to slow this year after an exceptionally strong 2023 as post-Covid travel subsides and its economy slows, but Chinese petrochemicals demand remains robust. And both India and the Middle East will support demand.
Meanwhile, on the supply side, deep cuts from OPEC+ have driven Brent crude futures into steeper backwardation (with prices for prompt delivery exceeding those for future delivery) on the back of expected OECD stock draws for the remainder of the year. The group’s continued commitment to short-term market management should give it the upper hand in keeping prices in their current range. In March, OPEC+ extended existing production cuts until the end of June (including a 1 million b/d unilateral Saudi cut and a revised schedule for Russian crude oil production and exports). The group’s propensity to be proactive on the downside and reactive on the upside will encourage continued caution, possibly encouraging it to extend its cuts into the second half to stabilize prices at their current $90 per barrel level. Non-OPEC supply growth will remain robust, but manageable from an OPEC+ perspective. And many forecasters expect that U.S. shale production growth will finally slow this year. Less exuberance from private players, consolidation in the shale patch, a falling number of drilled but uncompleted wells, and continued capital discipline suggest less upside. Shale producers continually surprise the market, and growth in the past few years has consistently surpassed expectations. But the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects U.S. crude oil production to rise this year by 260,000 b/d—well below last year’s growth rate. Geopolitical Risks Harder to Ignore
With fundamentals strong and inventories lean, markets will remain wary of geopolitical risks to supply, as the price rise over the past two weeks has illustrated. The volatility that characterized markets last year is also likely to return, as paper traders pay greater attention to geopolitical events. The threat of escalation has been a concern for markets since October, especially any signs that the war was extending to Iran. A wider war between Israel and Hezbollah that could drag Iran more directly into the ongoing conflict could be one catalyst for escalation. Thus far, all-out conflict on Israel’s northern border has not materialized, despite thousands of cross-border rocket and missile attacks since October and recent Israeli strikes deeper into Lebanese territory. Hezbollah’s aversion to a potential political backlash if it drags Lebanon into war, as well as U.S. pressure on Israel, have probably helped to keep the conflict from widening.
Recent events suggest it will become harder to contain such risks. An April 1 airstrike on Iran’s embassy compound in Damascus killed seven members of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, including a senior Quds Force commander who previously led operations in Syria and Lebanon. The United States and Israel are preparing for Iranian attacks on their assets in the region. Yet Iran will probably be wary of actions that will drag it into a direct confrontation with Israel or the United States, and past experience shows that a spectacular immediate response is not the likeliest outcome.
Iran may instead opt for “strategic patience” and a response that leverages its proxy forces and allied militias throughout the region. When the United States killed General Qassem Soleimani in a January 2020 drone strike, Iran responded by launching missiles at U.S. bases in Iraq that did relatively little damage, and it refrained from a wider immediate assault. In the past week, Iran’s president and Hezbollah’s leader have vowed to respond to the Israeli strike. But such a response may again feature symbolic attacks meant to signal Iranian resistance and defense of its interests, rather than a more brazen approach such as a Hezbollah rocket assault on Israel. The past few months have shown that Iran’s “axis of resistance” enables it to cause trouble throughout the region. Iran could encourage missile or drone attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria, scale up tanker attacks and sabotage in the Persian Gulf (Iran maintained plausible deniability for a series of such attacks in 2019), and increase its support for the Houthis. It is also possible that Iran could lash out against U.S. or Israeli interests outside the Middle East. These actions would be in keeping with Iran’s reliance “on the diversity and dispersion of its tools to make its adversaries reluctant to respond directly.”
Beyond the immediate threat of Iranian retaliation, there is a long-term risk associated with domestic political dynamics in Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains a particular wild card. His domestic popularity is sinking, and he faces the possibility of prosecution if he is removed from office, so Netanyahu has personal political incentives to extend the war, not just in time but also in scope. Israel’s recent strike in Damascus was part of an ongoing shadow war with Iran, but it also appeared designed to goad Tehran into more open retaliation. Escalation, even just against Hezbollah, would stretch the Israel Defense Forces operationally. Nevertheless, it would reinforce Netanyahu’s claims that Iran remains an existential threat to Israel that must be countered.
There are several important implications for the oil market. The biggest risk is that escalation draws Israel and Iran into more direct confrontation, which would put Iranian production at risk and raise the possibility that Iran could disrupt the 18 million b/d of oil flows through the Persian Gulf. Unlike the Red Sea, there are no alternative routes for Gulf shipping. If any such disruptions materialized, their impact on prices would be seismic given the volumes at risk. But even a heightened sense of threat will add a geopolitical premium to prices given current and anticipated fundamentals. 
These risks could ramp up just as the market is expected to tighten in the second and third quarter and the summer driving season begins in the United States. An oil price of $90 per barrel is no doubt causing anxiety in the Biden administration, which recently canceled its latest solicitation to help refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) due to higher prices. The Department of Energy has been gradually refilling the SPR, which now sits at 364 million barrels. If market risks accumulate and prices inch toward or above $100 per barrel, several options will be on the table for the White House, potentially including a shift from SPR refills to releases and renewed exhortations for OPEC+ to add barrels into the market.
This trajectory is not inevitable. Ultimately, the fundamentals win. It is quite possible that supply risks—especially the most apocalyptic—will not materialize, and the current bullishness will fade. But market psychology has shifted significantly, and it tends to take on a momentum of its own in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary. At a minimum, prices are likely to stay at their current level, and, as long as the conflict in the Middle East continues, volatility seems likely to return.

52,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/powering-american-diplomacy-21st-century-conversation-honorable-richard-r-verma,Unknown,"April 3, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS event hosted on April 3, 2024. Watch the full video here. John J. Hamre: Hey, good afternoon, everybody. Delighted to have you here. My name is John Hamre. I’m the president at CSIS. And really an honor and privilege to have you here. And the reason we’re doing this is because Secretary Verma is going to offer some remarks here first. And this is for the audience, the outside audience. And then we’re going to sit and have this conversation in front of all of you. Wanted to explain what the format is.
I had this conversation with Rich, gosh, maybe eight or nine months ago. And I said, what can I do to help? I mean, this is – the State Department is so vital for our future, and yet it’s so underappreciated, you know, in the American political landscape. And so he kindly agreed to do a session with us. And I’m so glad we have it here.
We’re partnering today on with the American Academy of Diplomacy. And I just want to say a sincere thanks, you know, to the Academy for joining us today. It is a collection of really the most talented former ambassadors, and then a few people like me, who just feel very strongly that America’s future really rests on creative, and thoughtful, and dedicated diplomacy. And so I just want to say thank you to them for being our sponsor, our cosponsor, here today.
I’ve known Secretary Verma, gosh, 30 years I suppose. He’s held up a lot better than I have, OK? We first met when he was with Jack Murtha, who was the ranking Democrat on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. And we struck up a deep friendship then, because he’s a very deep intellect and a thoughtful man. And then I was, of course, celebrating his success. He became assistant secretary for legislative affairs for the State Department. Went off and became our ambassador to India. Did a brilliant job there. And then now, of course, he’s back, and he is the deputy secretary for management and resources.
It’s a real privilege that he’s here today. We’re going to first hear from Secretary Verma. He’s got some prepared remarks. And then the two of us are going to engage in a conversation together. Thank you very much. Thank you all for being here. Would you please welcome Secretary Verma? (Applause.)
Deputy Secretary Richard R. Verma: Thanks, John. Thank you so much. And thank you, John, for the nice introduction. And thank you all for being here. I also want to thank CSIS. I want to thank the American Academy of Diplomacy for doing really incredible work and advocating for the department and all of its personnel. So thank you.
John Hamre told half of the story. I met him over 30 years ago, when I was working for the then-chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. John was both the comptroller of the Pentagon and he was the Deputy Secretary of Defense over the entire Clinton administration. And when you were in the Murtha office, there was a phrase that was uttered pretty much every day, multiple times a day. And it was: Call Hamre. Call Hamre. (Laughter.)
Whenever there was a problem, an issue, a question, an urgent matter – maybe not even an urgent matter, it was: Call Hamre. That phrase has stayed in my head, John, over 30 years. And I will tell you, there have been times when I have said to myself: Call Hamre. You should call Hamre. (Laughs.) So I’m really glad not only to see you, but I was so grateful for our conversation, as you said, many months ago where you actually asked us, what can we do to highlight some of the needs of the department both from a budget perspective and a personnel perspective? So I’m sorry it took eight or nine months to get here, but I’m really, really grateful to be here.
I want to – if I can, I just want to start with a bit of a brief recap. This week would mark my first year in office as deputy secretary for management. And it has been an honor to return to the department last April; as John mentioned, my previous service in India, the Bureau of Legislative Affairs. This has been an eye-opening experience, in many ways, to see the department from this vantage point.
In my first few weeks on the job we began evacuating Sudan and it has been a whirlwind ever since that. I will say, however, that everything I’ve seen and done since that first day has reinforced for me one key point which I hope you will take away from today and that is the Department of State as ever continues to deliver a tremendous value to the American people at a cost of approximately 1 percent of the national budget. One percent of the national budget.
When you actually ask – there’s a famous Pew poll – when you ask the American people what they think we spend on foreign assistance they say, oh, 20 percent, and when you ask them what they think it should be they say, well, really, it should be about 10 percent. And then they are shocked and surprised when they actually find out it’s 1 percent.
The department today stands at some 77,000 employees spread across nearly 300 embassies, consulates, and domestic operations. The Americans in our workforce come from every state in the union and nearly 20 percent of them are veterans.
As the deputy for management and resources, or DMR as the position is known, I have broad responsibilities for oversight and management of department operations including the department’s budget, foreign assistance programs, diplomatic missions, and our support to Americans overseas. Some describe it as the chief operating officer for the department.
In this capacity and in this first year I visited over 30 of our overseas missions just in this first year, from Kyiv to Baghdad, Jakarta, Comoros, Bogota, to the western Indian Ocean and many places in between and I’ve also visited about a dozen or so of our domestic facilities across the United States.
People have been asking me, why do you travel so much – isn’t your job here in D.C.? But I do think it’s critical to stay connected to the needs of our workforce including our terrific locally-employed staff.
I also come back from every trip inspired and motivated to do the right thing by our team spread across the globe. What you will find when you travel – and I encourage members of Congress and staff to get out there as much as they can – when they meet our teams around the world you find a committed and dedicated workforce serving globally, often in dangerous and difficult conditions.
At the end of the day, we are a national security agency with people serving bravely from Ukraine to Somalia and South Sudan to Iraq and Port-au-Prince and in so many other conflict zones. I could share stories of their creativity and effectiveness and heroism that I’ve seen during all this travel but the main point here is this.
In an age of increased competition, of global interconnectedness, of growing authoritarianism, it is vitally important for America’s diplomats and development professionals to show up everywhere we can to lead, to build, to grow, and to deepen cooperation.
As Secretary Blinken often says the world does not organize itself on its own and without U.S. leadership there often is adverse consequences. This is because the network of global friendships, partners, partnerships, and alliances the United States has built over the last several generations supports the lives and livelihoods of all Americans and billions of others around the world.
This network is one of the United States’ greatest strategic assets and what has and will support our continuing leadership in the world. And our ability to continue to lead is so important because we also know the world is changing, perhaps becoming more dangerous and, some would argue, less free.
We see more countries competing for more resources and more fractured international architecture, renewed great power competition, and a wide range of transnational threats. It was in this context even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the attacks of October 7th, or the latest instability in Haiti or parts of Africa that President Biden suggested the world is at an inflection point, a point where the decisions America makes now at home and abroad will impact generations to come.
These decisions, of course, include how we approach our competition with the People’s Republic of China or respond to Putin or others. They’re also decisions about how we respond to cybersecurity attacks and information warfare, how we push back the continuing threat of extremist groups, how we prepare for the next pandemic, address the impacts of climate change or integrate artificial intelligence into human endeavor.
They’re about how we address all these challenges that the CIA director, Bill Burns, calls, quote, “problems without passports” – problems that know no borders, problems that can only be solved through greater international cooperation.
We can acknowledge that these challenges have stretched the State Department in unprecedented ways. They’ve meant working in more places on more issues and problem sets than ever before.
And this brings me to the second point I hope you’ll take away today, which is, despite the challenges, the department is not resting on its laurels. We are also responding to the challenges in multiple ways, taking every step possible to make sure that the department remains fit for purpose.
And one main vector for this has been to carry out Secretary Blinken’s robust, multiyear modernization agenda. Now, I could spend the entire hour or more talking about everything we’ve done under the modernization agenda, but let me summarize it briefly, noting highlights from our three main lines of effort.
First, we’ve looked at our critical missions and made sure the department was organized to address these now and for the foreseeable future. We’ve stood up multiple new offices and bureaus and opened new diplomatic missions abroad. We’re now addressing issues like cyber and global health security in a more comprehensive way than we have before.
Second, we’ve taken several steps to invest in our world-class, worldwide workforce across all hiring types. We’ve diversified hiring pathways through paid internships and new authorities, redefined our approach to training and professional development, and established a new retention unit to evaluate factors affecting our employees’ decisions about whether to stay or go.
Finally, we are looking at our policies and safeguards on risk, on technology and innovation, ensuring there is a balance in our decision-making about information and physical security around the world. This is us – this has enabled us to embrace technology in new ways, yes, including AI, where appropriate, and advanced data analytics to aid in our decision-making and efficiencies.
We are also implementing new technology to be more efficient and effective in our traditional work. For instance, the department’s passport agencies and consular sections cleared out an epic COVID backlot last year, processing more than 24 million passport applications and issuing over 10 million visas.
The economic impact of all this incoming and outbound travel is immense. The Commerce Department estimates $1.7 trillion of U.S. economic activity is generated annually by the travel-and-tourism industry, directly or indirectly supporting approximately one of every 20 U.S. jobs. Indeed, 48 percent of Americans now hold a passport, up from 20 percent in 2006.
As Americans and lawful permanent residents travel abroad, State Department personnel all over the world help ensure their safety and support, including during times of crises. For instance, when violence erupted suddenly in Sudan, the department facilitated the safe departure of more than 1,400 private citizens, U.S. citizens, LPRs and others, in a true multinational effort.
After October 7th, we augmented limited local commercial transportation options with more than 7,500 seats on government-chartered transportation. We are also continuing to honor our promise by coordinating special immigrant visa processing for Afghan allies at over 60 posts worldwide. Our evacuation of U.S. nationals from Haiti continues. All told, our consular teams, just in fiscal year ’23, assisted 70,000 Americans across the world in times of crises and, frankly, personal emergencies that are never on the front pages of any newspaper. That’s what we are there to do.
Now, these are some of the demands and activities we’ve taken. Let me now come to what is at the center of my job description, which is: Do we have the resources and people to actually do our jobs?
As many of you know, we released the president’s fiscal year 2025 budget last month with a total request for State and USAID of $58.8 billion. We also now have our full-year FY ’24 appropriation at $56.7 billion, which is nearly 6 percent below our FY ’23 budget. This is a significant cut, but frankly not as bad as the House-passed bill last fall which cut the department’s budget by over 15 percent. Now, I’m grateful that Congress has funded many of our shared priorities, but this number, the FY ’24 number, means the department – we will have to make trade-offs; the dollars are simply unable to stretch as far as we need to meet the moment. And budget cycles do not always align with the global realities and crises, which is why we critically need the national security supplemental to respond to Ukraine, the Middle East, and the Indo-Pacific, as well as global humanitarian needs. As the White House has said, there is no other pot of money to address these emergencies happening today. Without the supplemental, we are limiting our ability to address some of the most important and difficult challenges of our time. In Ukraine, for example, the stakes are clear: If passed, the supplemental offers hope to a democratic Ukraine and its fight against Putin’s aggression. If we fail to act, we send the wrong signal to authoritarians everywhere. We must act.
And let’s take a look at some of the numbers. If you were to graph the State Department and USAID’s base budget over the period of the last 20 years, you’d see an increase of about $36 billion, from about $22 billion in the year 2000 to about $58 billion in 2023. As a comparator, however, DOD’s budget increased by nearly $600 billion over that same time period, more than 10 times the size of the entire State budget. Over those same 20 years, some of our most strident advocates have been our friends from across the river at the Pentagon. You’d witness testimony from Defense secretaries about the importance of funding diplomacy and development as complementary pillars of national security alongside the Defense Department. As General Mattis aptly put it, quote, “If you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition.”
We are also constrained by congressional inaction. In FY 2024, as I mentioned, we now have our full-year appropriation, but it is six months into the fiscal year, funding that was unavailable until just two weeks ago. In addition to these delays, we also lack the flexibility. Our annual appropriations bill is more than 300 pages with nearly 500 individual directives that constrain our programming. In fiscal year 2023, over 90 percent of our economic and development assistance was earmarked for specific priorities. All of this dilutes the department’s ability to adapt to real-time emerging crises.
None of this is intended to suggest government agencies can’t be innovative and find efficiencies. We have and we will always strive to do so. But I do, however, want to be candid about our reality and the challenges and the constraints we face. We must also find a way to support our national security priorities by consistently and fully funding the department and USAID for sustained period of time to ensure we can deliver for the American people. But we should also consider how these resource battles are impacting U.S. competitiveness globally. We know that while the State Department and USAID remain less than fully funded, the PRC has provided some $1.34 trillion in grants and loans over the past 22 years. Last October the PRC and President Xi announced an additional $100 billion more for China’s development banks. That’s on the funding side.
And with regards to our people, the State Department today has a 13 percent staffing gap, on average. We have also failed to send our ambassadors to key posts. Around 15 percent of our nominees remain unconfirmed, with average waits of over a year from nomination to confirmation. Nineteen of our ambassador nominees have been waiting 400 days or more.
I give you some examples. Our nominee for Albania, 432 days. Albania, where we have a significant number of Afghan refugees and a new platform there. Our ambassador to Djibouti, waiting 432 days. Djibouti, where we have several thousand U.S. troops. Our ambassador to Nigeria, the largest country in Africa, waiting 628 days. Our ambassador to Cambodia, waiting 647 days. Our ambassador to the African Union, waiting 654 days. Our ambassador to Ecuador, where there’s been renewed violence and gang warfare, waiting 589 days. I could go on, but I think you get the message. So these asymmetries between us and some of our competitors matter. We know the United States can present developing countries with better options, but without our ambassadors in the field, without consistent funding authorized and appropriated, we cannot reliably make our best case. So let me bring this to a close.
I started – as I mentioned, I started my career off working on Capitol Hill for Congressman Murtha. Mr. Murtha was a Democrat, and Marine, a Vietnam veteran. He could do battle with the best of them on domestic issues. But I also recall Jack Murtha sitting down each year to work out the defense budget with then-Secretary Weinberger, and following that Secretary Cheney, to hammer out the defense budget that they all agreed was necessary to support U.S. national security around the world. The same was true when I had the opportunity to work in the Senate leadership post-9/11. And we supported and worked with the Bush administration on the post-9/11 national security architecture, building everything from the Department of Homeland Security to our new national security authorities that we needed in the war on terrorism.
I would argue that the global situation today requires us to come together to find greater unity of purpose and strengthen and advance U.S. interests. Not that we need to agree on everything, but so we can advance what really matters. The State Department is the oldest Cabinet agency in the U.S. government, with a 250-year record of serving American interests. We are ready to continue that course, but we really do need to come together to achieve the president’s vision of a free, open, secure, and prosperous world.
So I look forward to this discussion here at CSIS with the hope that you will help us identify ways that we can get back to the point where partisan politics stops at the water’s edge, and that all our pillars of national security, defense, diplomacy, and development are powered up for the 21st century. Thank you. I look forward to the discussion. (Applause.)
Dr. Hamre: Thank you, Secretary Verma. Please join me here. We’re going to have a conversation. And, again, let me say thank you to Ron Neumann, to the American Academy. Really a marvelous institution that’s making America better every day. And it’s really great. And all of you, by the way. In the virtual audience – thousands of people are watching. But, of course, everybody here, we’re going to have a reception downstairs where you can meet and personally petition Secretary Verma – (laughter) – for whatever it is that you personally would like him to pay attention to. That’ll be downstairs in the fireplace room.
So, Secretary, let me – I was very taken by your presentation. You quoted somebody, but you said: The world does not organize itself on its own. So how do we talk to average Americans about why the State Department is important for them?
Dep. Sec. Verma: Yeah. It’s a great point. And I think we, frankly, have to do a better job of this, connecting the dots about what we do around the world, why it matters to the American people. Again, the president and secretary of state often like to say: Foreign policy begins at home. And I can make that argument about what we’re doing, about opening new markets around the world, about trying to secure greater diversity of energy supplies to bring down the cost of fuel, to try to ensure that supply chains are resilient during a time of pandemic or during a time of shortage, to ensure that our critical minerals that we need for chips and semiconductors are coming from reliable and secure sources.
Again, I also point to what we do for all those Americans that are around the world and run into a problem. When I think during my term as ambassador to India – a lot going on in the bilateral relationship – but if someone asked me really what were you most focused on and was your biggest concern it was the safety and security of the nearly 1 million Americans that are in India any given day. That’s what our job is.
I will also say a lot of what we do – I don’t know that I can draw a straight line back to someone where I grew up in Johnstown or in western Pennsylvania because a lot of what we do is simply the right thing to do, helping people who are in desperate conditions who are facing incredible instability.
But I think, as I pointed out in that poll about what the American people believe about foreign assistance, this has generally been bipartisan, it has generally been supported, and I think people, when they understand the mission set, I think they find it very true to American values.
So do we do that enough? Do we go back and remind people what we’re doing enough? We probably don’t.
The other thing I would say – and you’ve traveled a lot and you’ve served in senior most positions in government and you know this to be true and our – probably a lot of our former ambassadors here know exactly what I’m about to say, which is when you go out to a Ukraine, when you go to Iraq, when you go to Somalia – take your pick of really complicated places these days – and you go to that country team meeting in the morning and you get that briefing you see every agency of our government.
You don’t often know unless they’re wearing a uniform whether they are military, whether they are the intelligence agencies, whether they are State Department, whether they are USAID, and that’s the way we work. That is – we are integrated, we are supporting each other, and that’s the way I think the American people expect us to work.
But somehow when we come back here to Washington one person at that table gets a 7 percent increase in their budget and the other people at that table get a 7 percent cut. And so –
Dr. Hamre: They’re not equal. Seven percent –
Dep. Sec. Verma:
 No, exactly. (Laughter.) I would just remind folks about how we actually work together to support and advance American interests around the world.
Dr. Hamre:
 I think most Americans would be surprised to learn that half of the people in the embassies around the world are really from other agencies. They’re not State Department.
Dep. Sec. Verma: Right.
Dr. Hamre: It’s the platform for the entire United States government.
Dep. Sec. Verma: It is the platform for the entire U.S. government. It’s also why chief of mission authority and having a chief of mission confirmed by the U.S. Senate with the imprimatur of the Senate but also as the president’s representative showing up in country makes a big deal.
We have fabulous actings and charges and deputy chiefs of mission around the world. It is different when you show up with a letter from the president confirmed by the Senate and the host countries know that.
And, boy, our adversaries love it when we’re not there.
Dr. Hamre: Yeah.
Dep. Sec. Verma:
 And, you know, I think I mentioned there’s some – at least 30-plus countries – where we don’t currently have ambassadors, where the Chinese and the Russians are fully present.
Why would we give them that open lane to operate? It makes no sense strategically. It makes no sense from a just national security perspective.
Dr. Hamre:
 Yeah. What corporation would choose to keep vacant 20 percent of their senior executives? You know, what board of directors would ever tolerate that?
Dep. Sec. Verma: Right.
Dr. Hamre: This is just nonsense.
Dep. Sec. Verma:
 Right. So we have our senior positions vacant but we also have a staffing gap in the department. I mentioned on average it’s about 13 percent, and there’s a lot of reasons for this because, as I mentioned, we’re getting pulled in different directions. There was a hiring freeze in the prior administration. There were pretty significant cuts in the prior administration. We are digging our way back out of that.
But 13 percent is a big deal. Can you imagine if United Airlines or Microsoft or Google or the University of Virginia had 13 percent of its positions unfilled? What happens is you end up with then incredible workload burdens. You end up shifting certain duties. You end up with posts that don’t have enough people.
And so we’re in this race to catch up. But you can’t catch up if your budget, like this past year, has been cut by nearly 6 percent.
Dr. Hamre:
 Yeah. The DOD has – back when I was the comptroller, we had a fuel inflation-adjustment clause that I think was bigger than your field operating budget.
Dep. Sec. Verma: (Laughs.) Don’t tell me that. Right?
Dr. Hamre: No, I know. It’s just astounding –
Dep. Sec. Verma: Right.
Dr. Hamre: – because it’s not adequately budgeted. I completely agree with that.
I personally think that the State Department functions as our strategic-planning element for our federal government. We can’t do strategic planning about our relationship with Nigeria from Washington. You know, our politics here gets in the way. We need somebody in the embassy there that can help design that.
So how many vacancies – you say we have 30 vacancies now?
Dep. Sec. Verma:
 Currently, at least. I mean, it’s actually higher than that if you total up the number of people who are actually pending and going through the process. I think it’s a much higher percentage.
Dr. Hamre: Much higher.
Dep. Sec. Verma: Yeah.
Dr. Hamre: So it’s – well, it’s a real mistake for the country. Let’s just say that.
Dep. Sec. Verma:
 Well, so let me just say on that, a big believer in the, you know, advice-and-consent responsibilities of the Senate. I spent a number of years working there. My counterpart, you know, who was staff director of the Foreign Relations Committee at the time while I was working in the Senate leader’s office, was a guy named Tony Blinken, who’s come a long way over those years; now my boss.
And I don’t want to suggest that everything in the past was just so great and how we all just, you know – no one critiqued each other. Of course, it was loud and it was noisy. And, yes, politics is rough and tough. But for career people to be impacted the way they have been over the last few years, not being able to go to posts of consequence, with blanket holds, for example – and you know how the Senate works. One hold and, without a cloture vote, you’re not moving anywhere.
Dr. Hamre: Right.
Dep. Sec. Verma:
 And so it’s – I would say we don’t exactly have the right confirmation process to meet the needs of today, which has to work, I think, much faster and has to recognize that these are people that don’t do politics. These are people that do foreign policy and diplomacy. Should their credentials be assessed and evaluated? Absolutely. Should they go through a hearing? Absolutely. But that, I think, is what the constitutional requirements are. And then they should go and serve dutifully in their posts, the way they are, I think, desperate to do.
Dr. Hamre: Yeah. This is my statement, not yours, but since the Congress doesn’t legislate anymore, they use leverage on nominations to try to get policy objectives done. That’s my comment. That’s not yours.
Let me ask you – you highlighted three main thrusts. And the third one was policies on risk. You talked about physical security. And obviously we’re building wonderful new facilities. I think – you know, I think professional staffs need good-quality facilities. But there’s some criticism of them being kind of isolated from the community. How do you balance protecting your employees with having an engaged department in the field?
Dep. Sec. Verma: Right. I think if you were to talk to our workforce, they don’t want to be an hour outside the city center. They don’t want to be behind a big wall. They want to be engaged with the people. This very much is a contact sport. Showing up is a huge part of this, and engaging with the local population is what they want to do. And so we have a bit of a pendulum on this over the course of our history. If there is a security incident, if there is a bad event, there is the inclination to pull back and to build those bigger walls and to be more secure.
I think we just have to find the balance and accept a degree of risk that is responsible. And I think that is the mindset of our workforce. Again, they want to be forward-leaning. So this is part of our modernization agenda. And again, it has three parts to it. And this technology and risk is a big part of it. That’s the third pathway.
The other two pathways, though, I think, are pretty exciting. The second one is on workforce. And, you know, last year we had the biggest class of Foreign Service recruits ever, the most diverse, the most accomplished, you know, coming from all parts of the country, all levels of professional accomplishment; very excited about that. We’ve had incredible recruits on the Civil Service side as well.
This morning we had a town hall on critical missions. That is the first pathway of our modernization effort. And this is about making sure we’re doing the things that are actually coming across the inbox each day and that our governments that we engage with, and that the American people want us to be thinking about.
So why do we have a new Global Health and Security Bureau, for example? We just lived through this incredibly terrible period of global pandemic. I heard our Ambassador Nkengasong, who is the head of the bureau, talk this morning about how in 20 days COVID spread to 165 countries and over three years resulted in the deaths of 20 million people. If we didn’t have a new Global Health Bureau, I think the American people would be saying, what exactly are you working on, if not this issue of how to prevent and minimize the impact of the next pandemic?
We have a new Cybersecurity Bureau. Again, think about what’s happening in the cyber domain, whether through cyberattacks, or through misinformation and disinformation, and what’s happening around the world. So we are out there trying to set standards and compete, and use cyber as a part of our tradecraft, right? We have a new China house, which is a consolidated effort to manage our global competition with China. We have a new effort on commercial diplomacy. We have a new effort on climate diplomacy.
So it’s not everything, but it is those things that I think really matter. And this is not to add to the burden and workforce of the department. It is, frankly, to give people additional tools and skillsets so we can actually navigate our way forward in a – in a pretty difficult period. When I talk about how we’re being pulled and stretched like we haven’t been before, it’s not to suggest we’re at the most dangerous point in our history. And, you know, we’ve lived through some incredibly difficult periods. But it is to suggest that we need to be present in more places, doing a more diverse array of things, that I think we have seen before.
So we can’t afford not to be deployed across Africa. We cannot afford to not be deployed across the Indo-Pacific. And, yes, we have a hot war taking place in Ukraine. We have a terrible situation following the terrorist attacks of October 7th, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. And, yes, the potential for broader regional conflict in the Middle East. We have this incredible migration and security set of challenges here in this hemisphere. We have 125 million people displaced and on the move today around the world. So, look, that requires us to be just really maxed out in a way that I do think is unprecedented. I think we – I don’t like to throw around that word, “unprecedented,” you know, casually. But that’s what I feel and what I sense.
Dr. Hamre:
 You know there was a day when the State Department was kind of a laggard on technology, they probably – some of the people in this room remember typing on Wang computers, you know. (Laughter.) That was a long time ago. But how would you characterize the modernity now of the tools that you’re giving to the department?
Dep. Sec. Verma: Yeah. No, look, I feel – I actually feel really good about this. And I know there is that image of State Department personnel walking around with BlackBerry’s, you know, and kind of a good 10 or 15 years behind the time. That has not been my experience, not only in this job but in my – in my prior job in India as chief of mission, in which is now one of the largest embassies in the world. We were moving really fast. And I will say, we were a bit of – we were the envy of other diplomatic missions. We were driving the agenda. We had the technology we needed.
Fast forward to today. Again, just from a kind of user-friendly standpoint, I think the workforce would say, yeah, there’s things we could do better. But we have really good technology. But where I think we’ve even gone further – I mentioned AI, I mentioned data analytics. We have really embraced it responsibly. And we understand the risks, but if we can take some of the 2(00) or 300 reports that we have to do each year and submit to Congress, if we can use advanced tools to help us kind of reduce some of the hours that go into that, the tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of hours, that’s a good thing.
We have these incredibly large datasets. If we can take those data sets and correlate and extract conclusions we couldn’t do before because of these advanced tools, we should be doing that, and we have really, really first-rate people –
Dr. Hamre: You have people that can do that now?
Dep. Sec. Verma:
 We have people doing that now, and frankly, when I go into interagency meetings and talk about how we’re using advanced technology, frankly people are surprised and they’re impressed. I’m grateful for what the team has done and I believe we are now no longer considered behind. I think we’re leading the way.
Dr. Hamre: You know, in your prepared remarks you referred to testimony that our friend Jim Mattis gave that if he didn’t fund the State Department he’d have to buy more ammunition. I think that’s a metaphor for the State Department really being a defense agency. Would you reflect on that?
Dep. Sec. Verma:
 I don’t see it as a defense agency, but I do see it as a national security agency. I don’t think there’s any question. And again, I’ve been privileged over the course of my career to see various Defense secretaries and chairmen of the Joint Chiefs go in – for example, into the Murtha subcommittee – and talk about fully funding the State Department. I remember when I was assistant secretary Mr. Murtha trying to move several billion dollars from the Defense Department over to the State Department and it became so hard to do –
Dr. Hamre: (Laughs.) I think I fought that. (Laughs.)
Dep. Sec. Verma: Right. Thank you. (Laughs.) Yeah. He wasn’t able to pull it off in the end, but Secretary Gates and others were actually strongly supportive of fully funding because when you think about the mission set that we’re doing, it is diplomacy, it is conflict prevention, it is negotiating, it is trying to address some of those root causes that lead to greater instability, whether that’s on the development side, whether that’s on the giving countries the tool to build up their own capacity on the security side. That’s what we’re supposed to be doing. And if we’re not doing it, you’ve got generally some bad actors, some malign states, some bad kind of nonstate actors in there filling that void, and we see that playing out in countries around the world. If we are not there pushing back, as I said, dangerous things and bad things can happen. So I think that was the Admiral Mullen, Jim Mattis, Secretary Gates – that is what they were trying to say is that this doesn’t make any sense to put all of the U.S. government’s resources in the warfighting machine; let’s work on preventing the war from actually happening.
Dr. Hamre: Yeah. Yeah. And when we have to use military force, we create dynamics that we don’t anticipate that become even more complicated. It’s just far better to have diplomacy to help mitigate and avoid those issues.
Could I just ask you, Secretary, you’ve worked up on the Hill. You mentioned the bipartisan quality that existed when you were with Jack Murtha and the open conversations that Mr. Murtha had with Dick Cheney. How would you characterize your interactions now with the Congress? Is it pugilistic? Is it – behind closed doors is it more open and conversational? How would you characterize where we are now?
Dep. Sec. Verma: Yeah. It’s challenging. It’s challenging. And look, there’s a – what’s happening around the world, the debate about kind of how involved to be in the world, the role of foreign assistance, the importance of democracy – these are debates taking place all over the world, including here in the United States. So it’s no surprise that we are also impacted in those debates. I think there used to be, I think, a much broader, stronger bipartisan consensus about the role of the United States in the world and the tools that we would employ. And I understand why there has been pushback. I understand we’ve lived through a very hard last 20 years. Between the sacrifice and service and expenditure in both Afghanistan and Iraq, I think people come away from some of those experiences saying, show us what we have gained from it. And so I understand there’s been pushback. And that’s where it gets back to kind of demonstrating the value of what we’re doing and what happens if we’re not there. And I can weave a very positive story together, again, about what I’ve seen around the world and what our people are doing across the board, not just in our government, but our retirees, our college students, our nonprofits, our universities, our businesses. I mean, we really are – we are really having a positive impact around the world.
And so I’m not looking for unanimity of views. I’m not looking for everyone to put us on the back. But what I also am not looking for is for people to damage the department, right? I’m happy to have a policy debate, but I think for people who want to actually do harm to the federal government, that is a different thing that I haven’t seen over the course of my career. And I think we have to really push back on that. We can have a debate about the size of the budget. We can have a debate about policy issues. And I’m happy to have those debates, vigorous debates. But we – I think we’ve now run the risk of taking it a bit too far, given the kind of dysfunction and divisions that we have here at home.
Just bring Admiral Mullen back into this. When he testified, again, a few years ago, what he was most worried about in terms of national security threat, he didn’t bring up China or Russia. He brought up American divisions here at home. And that worries me. And I hope we can get back to a place where, as I describe it, the national security game, at least, used to be played between the 40-yard lines. It was a game that was played at midfield. And we really did – once we were deployed overseas or were working on missions overseas, there was this kind of broader base of support. I want to figure out how to get back to that.
Dr. Hamre:
 My colleagues in the American Academy of Diplomacy about a year ago were not as flattering about the department’s work on commercial diplomacy. Can you talk about what it is that you’re now doing?
Dep. Sec. Verma: Sure. I think, first, we’re trying to give folks additional tools and training in commercial diplomacy. So there’s a whole series of classes and workshops that the Foreign Service Institute is actually providing to our State Department personnel so that they are actually out engaging in a way that they probably haven’t before. I don’t know. I have seen our folks really lean into this in a way that has been helpful to creating more jobs for Americans back here at home. When I used to go to a plant opening, or – you know, in India – I would always say, tell me the advantage to American workers? Tell me the advantage to American shareholders? Why are we doing this here? I think it’s important to be able to tell that story.
And we can’t just, you know, trade with each other in the United States. We have to be out busting open new markets, trying to compete vigorously setting standards in a way that benefit the American workforce. Again, I had this incredible experience of not only being from an immigrant family, but showing up in Johnstown, Pennsylvania in 1971, where the economy was booming, the steel mills were roaring, the coal mines were delivering an incredible amount of energy. That was the community that powered the war machine. That was a community that sent off sons and daughters around the world to protect American interests.
And then I also was there to see, over the course of the late ’70s and ’80s, that community get left behind. And in the name of globalization, in the name of, you know, international trade, and in the name of, you know, internationalism. And I can understand why people can be angry about that. And so, when we talk about foreign policy begins at home, and whether it’s commercial diplomacy or whatever work we’re doing, we have to remember and be able to connect the dots back for people – my friends, my neighbors, my classmates back in Johnstown – to say what we’re doing matters to them. You mentioned commercial diplomacy. I think that’s a great example of what we should be doing more of, and actually show results so people don’t get left behind in an era of really intense global competition.
Dr. Hamre:
 Yeah. I mean, you’re wise to raise it. You know, I mean, globalization, the benefits were spread broadly to everybody. We all got cheaper sneakers, you know, and T-shirts. But the pain was concentrated.
Dep. Sec. Verma: Absolutely.
Dr. Hamre:
 It was concentrated where people lost jobs in a community. And it was –we didn’t really address that. And it was a real mistake over the last years. Now we have to.
Dep. Sec. Verma: Hundred percent.
Dr. Hamre:
 Secretary, you may not want this question. (Laughs.) You can duck it. But there are stories in the last couple of days about surreptitious directed-energy weapons being used against diplomats. Can you just say a word about that?
Dep. Sec. Verma:
 Sure. Yeah, and this is something we’ve spent a lot of time on, the anomalous health incidents, or AHI. Look, what we have said is that what people have experienced has been real in terms of their pain, their suffering, and that we are committed to taking care of them and making sure they have the health care they need and the benefits. And there’s legislation that actually is out there that supports them. And that is exactly what the State Department has been doing.
The question of attribution – and you’ve probably seen what the intelligence community has said. And I, you know, will just repeat what they’ve said. They have not been able to attribute it to a state actor. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be taking care of the people who have undergone some health experience.
Dr. Hamre: Sure.
Dep. Sec. Verma: And that’s what we are committed to doing. And I would say that to the workforce, and I’ve said it, and I’ll say it here with you.
Dr. Hamre: Yeah. I just have – I have to believe that there are some people inside the intelligence community that feel there is – it is possible to attribute. And they’ve been providing this now to a public –
Dep. Sec. Verma: Well, I think the other – the other thing I would say is that the research will go on, and it is continuing to this day. And we should continue to research it.
Dr. Hamre: Well, our State Department people are on the front line every day.
Dep. Sec. Verma: Every day.
Dr. Hamre: And in some places, it’s pretty dangerous. It’s got to be pretty rocky. And so we really do – this is a testament of our fidelity to them. They’re putting their life on the line. We owe that to them.
We’re coming to the end of our time together, Secretary. Let me ask if I could just – as you’re looking to a vision for the department, there are a lot of people who say, you know, we’ve got – you know, everybody now knows how to book a reservation. They can fly any place in the world; the internet. You can talk to people. You can book arrangements locally. So why is the State Department still so important for us?
Dep. Sec. Verma: Look, I tried to lay out a bit of a global picture again in this first year, going to some 34, 35 consulates and embassies kind of far and wide. And you see this very complicated global landscape; yes, on one hand, incredible promise, incredible innovation, incredible discovery. We all walk around with these supercomputers in our hands and pockets, and we’re learning more than we ever have. Development indicators are getting better in many parts of the world.
But we also see more players on the field, a more fractured international space, more countries competing for power. We have, again, as I mentioned, a very significant ongoing conflict in Ukraine. We have a very significant ongoing conflict with Israel and Hamas. We have this potential broader regional situation. We have an intense competition with the PRC. We have all these transnational threats that we’ve talked about, whether it’s climate or cyber or pandemics. We have the migration challenge. We have the income inequality. We have democratic retrenchment. I could go on and on.
And we have a world that doesn’t organize itself. And we have a tradition and a history of U.S. leadership. And we have a good story to tell. And we have people that want to serve abroad to protect and advance U.S. interests with our partners and allies.
And so, look, I see that world. And, yes, it is very challenging. And then when – as I said, when I come back from one of my trips, I come back ready to work even harder because I just see this incredible team of committed people just throwing themselves into this mission set to try to make the world a safer, more prosperous, more durable place for future generations. And that’s a great story. And the department plays such a significant role in that, along with our development friends, along with our Peace Corps volunteers, along with everyone that goes in to being out there in the international ecosystem.
But the State Department function in all of that – as you said, that chief of mission, that platform that we have – is so key. So I am – at the same time, I am excited about the future if we can get this right. If we can get the funding right, if we can get our personnel onto the field, if we can get this bipartisan consensus back, I’m excited about what lies ahead despite all these challenges that I’ve outlined.
Dr. Hamre: A friend of mine who’s a teacher was – he conducted a little learning thing with his students. He said: Where does electricity come from? And they said: Well, that switch on the wall.
Dep. Sec. Verma: (Laughs.)
Dr. Hamre: You know, well, what’s behind that, you know? Who builds the grid? Who establishes the standards? Who thinks about the future to know that there’s going to be enough energy for next year if it’s a hot summer?
Dep. Sec. Verma: Right.
Dr. Hamre: In the world of international relations, that’s what the State Department does. You build that infrastructure and working relationships that – so my passport is good. I go around the world. That passport’s quality, but that’s because the State Department is doing – is standing behind that. So it’s a much bigger story that we need to tell to the American public.
I mean, I feel very fortunate that you’re willing to serve. It is not an easy time to serve in public life these days. But someone of your quality, it’s a real privilege to have you.
Dep. Sec. Verma: I appreciate that. It’s an honor. And every day I walk into the building, I don’t take it for granted. And it’s just a – it’s a huge honor. And I also remember back to something President Obama said to me as I was headed out to India, which was, you’re in these jobs for a relatively short period of time in the grand scheme of human history here; just try to make it better and try to – (laughter) – try to build it stronger for the people that come after you. And that’s what we’re trying to do.
Dr. Hamre: You did that. You did that as ambassador. You’re doing it now as deputy secretary.
All of you are going to say thank you to the secretary privately downstairs when we go down and have some refreshments. But for now, please, with your warm applause, say thank you. (Applause.)
Dep. Sec. Verma: Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)

53,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/launch-united-states-guidance-online-platforms-protecting-human-rights-defenders-online,Unknown,"March 29, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS event hosted on March 29, 2024. Watch the full video here. Michelle Strucke: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. I’m so delighted to have you here with us today, and delighted to have those who are all tuning in online for this very important discussion of the launch of the United States Guidance for Online Platforms on Protecting Human Rights Defenders Online. I want to thank our partners in this effort, the United States Department of State as well as Access Now and the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Lab, for all their support in putting this event together today.
My name is Michelle Strucke. I’m the director of the Human Rights Initiative and the Humanitarian Agenda here at CSIS. And today, as – in 2024, according to the Digital 2024 Global Overview Report, 5 billion active social media profiles exist in the world. As a percentage of global population that is 62 percent of the world that is engaging in social media. Mobile phone users now are up to almost 70 percent of the global population, and more than 66 percent of all people on Earth now use the internet. So this issue is affecting the daily fabric of all of our lives as they change and become increasingly reliant on social media platforms for our commerce, our entertainment, our utilities even and how we pay our bills, all the way to how we engage in networks.
And people who are experiencing some of the positives of this are human rights defenders, but also some of the negatives, of people who are the dark underside of the – of the internet, that’s being used to track, threatened, target, and harm people, including human rights defenders – the very people that are upholding the values we all care about, of human rights, democracy, and other important issues. And human rights defenders include everyone from members of NGOs, and trade unions, to environmental advocates, and land rights activists, women’s rights champions, and anticorruption activists and representatives of indigenous people. So really, some of the most important people that we rely on to fight for human rights are being impacted positively and negatively by this issue.
So, it couldn’t be more important than it is today to have this discussion. And I’m really glad you decided to join us. For those who are watching in the room, we have the recommendations listed on here on the screen, and you can also use your phone to scan the QR code if you want to look at the full report. For those following online, you can also access that to see. I’ll give a couple announcements. Just that if there’s any emergency, the emergency exits are right behind you and the bathrooms are down the hall. Again, it’s my pleasure to be with you here today. And I will now introduce the special guests that we have here, that are going to share with us some important thoughts.
So, first, we will have remarks by Kelly Razzouk, who is the National Security Council special assistant to the president and senior director for democracy and human rights. Kelly currently serves at the White House National Security Council as special assistant to the president and senior director for democracy and human rights. And prior to this she was acting chief of staff and deputy chief of staff for policy for the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield. From 2018 to 2020, she was the director of humanitarian policy and advocacy for the International Rescue Committee, IRC, where she represented the organization at the United Nations.
And she’s held numerous U.S. government roles throughout her career advancing key U.S. priorities at the U.N. in New York. She’s also served as a human rights ambassador to Ambassador Susan Rice and then as senior policy adviser to Ambassador Samantha Power where she led key human rights initiatives for the Obama administration, including efforts to secure the release of political prisoners around the world. She’s had a distinguished career as well as a civil servant, working in a variety of important State Department bureaus. And she has a juris doctor from DePaul University College of Law, where she was a Sullivan human rights law fellow. So I couldn’t be more delighted to introduce Kelly here to the podium to kick us off with some keynote remarks. Thank you. (Applause.)
Kelly Razzouk: Thank you so much, Michelle, for that introduction. And thanks to all of you for being here today. It’s such an honor to be at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. It’s my first time here. And I’m so thrilled to be in the room with experts from civil society, from technology companies, from governments, and to host this launch in partnership with Access Now and the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab.
Technology, as Michelle said, and as all of you know, has fundamentally transformed the fight for human rights around the world. Online platforms enable activists to mobilize and share information more quickly and more widely than ever before. But at the same time, human rights defenders across the globe too often face technology-facilitated threats and attacks, such as targeted surveillance, censorship, and harassment. These attacks can also move from the digital to the physical world. The misuse of commercial spyware, for example, has been linked to arbitrary detentions, disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and transnational repression.
A woman was physically attacked and sexually assaulted for her advocacy highlighting the growing hate against LGBTQI+ people online. A reporter, focused on exposing acts of corruption, was murdered at a carwash after being targeted by commercial spyware. And these are just two of the stories. Last week, at the third Summit for Democracy in Seoul, the United States convened a high-level side event focused on the misuse of commercial spyware. And the reason we highlighted this at the Summit for Democracy is because it’s both a national security and counterintelligence threat, but it’s also a very real threat to democracy.
My colleague, Maher Bitar, who serves as coordinator for intelligence and defense policy at the White House, and I co-moderated a panel at the summit that brought together ministers from countries, journalists, civil society, and private sector experts – like representatives from the investor community – to discuss the importance of exposing the misuse of commercial spyware and protecting human rights defenders. The journalists talked about the fear they had, not only for themselves but for their loved ones who faced profound risks to their safety and security. Their comments reflected what I’ve heard over and over again as I’ve had the honor of meeting with heroic journalists and human rights defenders from around the world who have been victims of online attacks.
They’ve described the chilling effect that commercial spyware intrusions have had on their ability to continue their reporting and their activism, the isolation they faced from colleagues and counterparts who now feared any contact with them. One prominent Russian journalist has publicly described an intrusion by commercial spyware as, “feeling like she was stripped naked in the street.” Online attacks are all-too-often gendered as well. Around the world, an estimated 85 percent of women and girls have experienced or witnessed some form of online harassment and abuse. Indeed, gendered information manipulation and nonconsensual synthetic content are frequently designed to silence and suppress women political and public figures, by forcing women to self-censor or limit their online activity.
The growing access to and use of artificial intelligence further exacerbates these harms, by expanding the speed and scale of intimidation, manipulation, and synthetic content – including nonconsensual intimate images, facilitating highly targeted and pervasive surveillance, and enabling enhanced and refined online censorship. The companies and civil society organizations represented here know these harms all too well. Many of you have reported on the insidious tactics of nefarious actors that use online platforms to target members of civil society, journalists, and activists. Addressing these threats is critical not just for the individual survivors of attacks, but it is also a global imperative for the defense of inclusive representative democracies.
The United States government remains resolute in our commitment to address these harms. As President Biden said at the second Summit for Democracy, we must ensure that technologies are used to advance democratic governance, not to undermine it. The United States helped develop this guidance that we are launching here today for online platforms to support governments, civil society, and the private sector to come together to fight back against these human rights abuses. This platform guidance is part of a whole-of-government effort to – as Secretary Blinken explained last week at the third summit – to build an inclusive rights-respecting technological future that sustains democratic values and democratic institutions.
Last March, the president issued an executive order prohibiting U.S. government use of commercial spyware that poses risks to national security or has been misused by foreign actors to enable human rights abuses around the world. Over the past year, the United States has leveraged sanctions, export controls, foreign assistance programs, and visa restrictions to support victims and hold governments and firms accountable. We’ve built a global coalition of countries committed to this cause. In fact, last week at the summit in addition to hosting the site event that I just mentioned, we also announced that six new countries would join the joint statement on efforts to counter the proliferation and misuse of commercial spyware, adding to the inaugural 11 countries.
Additionally, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at the Department of Homeland Security has been partnering with many of the organizations and companies in this room to protect high-risk communities, including civil society organizations and human rights defenders, through their Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative. And at the first Summit for Democracy in 2021, the Biden administration launched the Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse, which brings together governments international organizations, civil society, and the private sector to accelerate progress towards safety and accountability for women and girls online.
One thing we know to be true is that we cannot do any of this alone. We need the expertise of civil society actors, the private sector, and online platforms. Today’s launch is a starting point for these important conversations that will take place going forward as we look to continue to strengthen these partnerships. Thank you for your time today, and we look forward to the conversations and the work ahead to address these critical issues. (Applause.)
Ms. Strucke: Thank you so much.
It is now my pleasure to introduce Ambassador Robert Gilchrist. He’s the senior bureau official in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor at the U.S. Department of State. Previously, he served as principal deputy assistant secretary since September 11th, 2023. He’s a career member of the senior foreign service, class of minister-counselor. His last position was United States ambassador to the Republic of Lithuania, from 2020 to 2023.
Prior to being ambassador, Mr. Gilchrist served as director of the Department of State’s Operations Center, deputy chief of mission to the U.S. Embassy in Sweden, deputy chief of mission to the U.S. Embassy in Estonia, and the director of Nordic and Baltic affairs at the State Department’s Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs. And among his earlier assignments in his distinguished career, he was also the deputy political counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Iraq, chief of the political section of the U.S. Embassy in Romania, and a special assistant in the Office of the Deputy Secretary of State. So please join me in welcoming Ambassador Robert Gilchrist. (Applause.)
Ambassador Robert S. Gilchrist: Thank you, Kelly. Thank you, really, to all of you for joining us this morning as we officially launch the U.S. Guidance for Online Platforms on Protecting Human Rights Defenders Online. I’d like to extend my thanks to CSIS, Atlantic Council, and Access Now for cohosting this event, and to many of you in this room for your insights, inputs, and reflections during consultations we held over the last year as we developed this guidance.
I’m Robert Gilchrist, a senior bureau official in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor at the Department of State. Human Rights defenders, or HRDs as we call them, play an integral role in promoting and protecting human rights. And governments and private sector companies should take steps to protect HRDs, and respect for the rights and values for which they so fearlessly and tirelessly advocate.
The United States developed the Guidance for Online Platforms we’re launching today in response to the rapid growth of online threats against HRDs around the world. We remain resolute and our commitment to put human rights at the center of our foreign policy, and to condemn attempts to silence human rights defender’s voices through threats, harassment, criminalization, or acts of violence.
We are grateful that the EU shares this commitment and is working with us, through the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, to elevate the voices of defenders and underscore their essential role as individuals on the frontlines, defending human rights. On March 11th, we released a joint U.S.-EU recommendations outlining 10 steps companies can take to better identify, mitigate, and provide access to remedy for digital attacks targeting HRDs.
U.S. guidance builds off those recommendations by providing specific actions and best practices companies can take to protect HRDs who may be targeted on or through platforms, products, or services. This guidance is addressed broadly to online platforms that host third-party content, but we also hope it can support collaboration within the broader ecosystem, including with civil society organizations who directly work with human rights defenders and act as trusted partner organizations to these platforms.
I also want to clarify who this guidance is designed to protect. The United States defines human rights defenders as individuals working alone or in groups who nonviolently advocate for the promotion and protection of universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms. Defenders can be of any gender identity, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious belief or nonbelief, disability status, or profession. Some HRDs identify more readily as journalists, labor leaders, environmental activists, community leaders, researchers, lawyers, or volunteer election observers.
HRDs continue to face threats and attacks, including arbitrary or unlawful online surveillance, censorship, harassment, smear campaigns, disinformation – to include gendered disinformation – targeted internet shutdowns, and doxing. And online attacks often pave the way for physical attacks, including beatings, killings, enforced disappearances, and arbitrary detention. As threats to defenders and democratic values escalate and evolve, preserving safe spaces for HRDs to work online is more important than ever.
As Kelly mentioned, the U.S. government takes a broad approach to protecting democratic values online. At the State Department and within DRL, my bureau, we are committed to supporting and protecting HRDs so that they can carry out their essential work without hindrance or undue restriction, and free from fear of retribution against them or their families. In Washington and throughout the world, department staff maintain regular contact with human rights defenders.
Our embassies have dedicated human rights officers who regularly monitor human rights developments, meet with defenders and their families, and advocate for our shared principles. Over the past decade, the department has provided $60 million to directly support almost 10,000 human rights defenders from more than 130 countries and territories. From journalists to anticorruption actors, and environmental defenders, to labor activists, this often lifesaving assistance has enabled over 90 percent of recipients to safely return to their work.
While we are committed to enabling the work of HRDs and CSOs as a government, this is a collective responsibility. Online platforms provide important tools and services to enable the work of HRDs. And they can do more to help them do that work safely. As companies, they have a responsibility to respect human rights in line with U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
We hope our guidance, which was developed in consultation with HRDs, civil society, organizations, and platforms – many of you in this room – we hope our guidance will provide companies with a blueprint of actions they can take to better protect HRDs. We ask that you adopt and adapt the recommendations in this guidance to improve your own policies and processes.
Thank you to our esteemed panelists for being here today and for sharing your perspectives on opportunities for continued collaboration. Collective problems demand collective solutions. And I am heartened to see so many stakeholders engaging with us today. We are all partners in this effort. Thank you so much. (Applause.)
Ms. Strucke: Thank you, everyone. I’m now very pleased to introduce our distinguished panelists, who will have a moderated conversation, that I will moderate, with each of them. And then we’ll have about 15 minutes at the end to have a question-and-answer session. You can raise your hand in the room if you’d like to ask a question and we have a microphone that will be coming around to you. If you’re online watching, you can submit a question and I will be able to see that question and ask it in the room, so we have full participation, hopefully, from both online and audience members here.
So, without further ado, I will introduce the distinguished panelists. So starting here to my left is Jason Pielemeier, who’s the executive director of the Global Network Initiative, or GNI. Jason leads a dynamic, multistakeholder human rights collaboration building consensus for the advancement of freedom of expression and privacy among technology companies, academics, human rights, and press freedom groups, and investors. Prior to joining GNI, Jason was a special advisor at the U.S. Department of State where he led the Internet Freedom, Business, and Human Rights Section in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. And in that role, he worked with colleagues across the U.S. government, counterparts in other governments, and stakeholders around the world to promote and protect human rights online.
Next to him is Wai Phyo Myint, the Asia Pacific policy analyst at Access Now. She has been working as a digital rights activist in Myanmar for about 10 years, and has previous experience in political advisory, media, and communications. Wai Phyo has served as one of the leading persons in Myanmar organizing the Myanmar Digital Rights Forum since it was first held in 2016. And it was – and it is and was the cornerstone for the digital rights movement.
Then we have Alex Walden, who is the global head of human rights for Google. Alex Walden is Google’s global head of human rights and free expression. She builds partnerships to promote free speech and expression and to combat internet censorship and filtering across the globe. She also coordinates policy and strategy around these issues for the company. Prior to joining Google, Alex worked at the Raven Group, Center for American Progress, and now Legal Defense and Education Fund. She also has served as a law clerk for the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary and for the House of Representatives, in the Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee of the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Liberties. And worked for the U.S. EEOC, U.S. Department of Labor, and Bay Area Legal Aid during law schools. Thank you, Alex, for being here.
And last but not least, I have Sheryl Mendez, who is the senior program manager of Freedom House’s Emergency Assistance Program. Sheryl has worked for over a decade advocating for and providing emergency assistance and logistical support to human rights defenders and journalists at risk worldwide. In her role at Freedom House, she provides support to human rights defenders and civil society organizations who are at risk due to their human rights work. Prior to joining Freedom House, she worked with the Committee to Protect Journalists, founded the Crimes of War Project, and helped launch a Culture of Safety Alliance – an unprecedented collaboration between news organizations, press freedom NGOs, and journalists to promote journalist safety. Mendez is also a widely published photojournalist who has trained journalists and documentary photographers in the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe.
So, thanks so much for this discussion today. I wanted to start with a little – couple questions to help set the stage for the participants that are watching and here in the room. So, I’ll start with Alex and then Jason with a question. You’ve worked closely with the private sector on addressing these human rights risks associated with technology for a number of years, and therefore have this very unique perspective on how companies have worked to address threats to human rights and human rights defenders over a period of years. So, what would be interesting, I think, for the audience is to know how have you seen these risks change over time? Are there private sector actions that have worked really well in combating these issues? And are there any hard lessons learned that you can share? And, you know, if you want to say, if there’s common standards today that maybe you pushed for that once seemed unachievable, really help us understand that journey of how this – the kind of situation has changed over time and how you think these guidance fit into those broader efforts.
So, Alex, we’ll start with you.
Alexandria Walden: Sure. Thanks for the question. And thanks for including us in the conversation today. It’s a great question, because I think what’s happened over – I mean, I’ve been at Google for now almost nine years. And when I look at sort of how the industry has changed, how technology has changed over that time, and sort of the way the ecosystem of civil society has coalesced around these issues. So, sort of, we’re still dealing with permutations of the same thing, right? There are people who are trying to defend human rights and exercise their human rights, and there are bad actors – governments or otherwise – who are targeting them and trying to stop them from doing that good work.
So, sort of that the quintessential problem remains the same, but the tools available to bad actors have certainly evolved. And the tactics that bad actors use have also evolved. So, teams within companies have over time, I think, become more resourced to look at these things and kind of become attuned to tracking. And we’ve developed intel teams inside of companies that are looking at how are bad actors trying to manipulate our technology and our platforms to harm, in particular, our vulnerable users. And I think companies have also sort of made more efforts to engage with civil society to understand exactly how the problems are manifesting, and how they look different in different places around the world and – different and the same.
And so, ultimately, like, yes, there – and also, we have AI and generative AI. And these things are, again, morphing, the ways in which people are using technology to abuse rights defenders. So, all of those things are changing, and still the fundamental problem is the same, that how do we kind of collectively work together to understand how problems are evolving, to fight back against them? But it’s constant, right? The threats are evolving. And so, our response to them has to evolve at the same time.
Ms. Strucke: Jason would love to hear your thoughts.
Jason Pielemeier: Yeah. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you to CSIS for hosting, to the State Department, Access Now, DFR Lab. This is – and to everyone who did the hard work to put this guidance together. I think it’s really a wonderful set of principles. And I think it will have really sort of meaningful and important impact. So, kudos.
To the question, and building off what Alex said, I think it’s worth taking a step back. In part, because I do think these principles really build nicely on a foundation of work that is, you know, in some ways, 20 or more years in the making. I think, for the purposes of this conversation, it’s worth kind of starting with the U.N. guiding principles, which were developed in a really creative way by John Ruggie, who was the special representative for business and human rights at the time, to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and then sort of carried out a multiyear, multistakeholder series of negotiations that produce the Protect, Respect, Remedy Framework, which we now know as the U.N. guiding principles, which were endorsed unanimously by the Human Rights Council in 2011.
And that framework really kind of was a pivot point, in that it created a foundational shared understanding of the respective duties of states and responsibilities of companies, highlighting in addition the importance of remedy. The GNI principles were negotiated in parallel to that process. And, in fact, John Ruggie had an advisor who was embedded in the GNI negotiations. And there was a lot of crosstalk that time. The GNI principles came out of a series of incidents that were the result of persecution of human rights defenders using data that had been given to a number of authoritarian governments by U.S. tech companies. And so, the concerns about human rights defenders – I don’t think that was a term that was necessarily used at that point in time – but the sort of underlying situation of journalists and activists who were trying to use these new technologies and tools to do their work, being threatened and persecuted as a result of that, was very much what animated the GNI principles.
So we have U.N. guiding principles, the GNI principles, sort of apply specifically to the tech sector. And since then, over the last 15 years, we have seen, I think, a tremendous growth in terms of the amount of attention, the amount of resources that are put into questions around technology and human rights. So Alex mentioned that, you know, a number of tech companies now have – they have put more time and resources into this. At GNI, we have a set of principles and implementation guidelines that our member companies, like Google, commit to implementing. And then we have a kind of unique assessment process that holds them to account to those commitments.
At a very high level, those involved creating a human rights policy that applies across the company, embedding that policy through dedicated staff and trainings across the relevant parts of the company, having senior-level oversight of that work, creating appropriate escalation channels, putting in place the human rights due diligence processes that are needed to become aware of and be able to respond to human rights risks, including with respect to defenders. And then having appropriate remedy and transparency throughout. So that framework, if it sounds familiar, it’s because it’s very similar to the one that’s in these guidelines. And I think that is a really sort of helpful way to structure this, because it takes advantage of what companies have already been working on now for over a decade, and sort of hits all of those sorts of points. So that coherence, I think, will be really useful in terms of the ability of companies to take and implement this guidance. It will also help civil society organizations and advocates on the outside who are already familiar with these frameworks be able to advocate and hold companies accountable in a more consistent way.
Ms. Strucke: Thank you. Thank you both for this really great overview of how we ended up here and how these principles are such a – these guiding principles are such an important practical step forward.
So, I want to take it now to Wai Phyo. You have such a unique perspective on these issues, having worked as a human rights defender in Myanmar and also for an organization that specifically is geared at helping other defenders. So, I’d love to hear a little bit about the context that you were working in. And then kind of if you could take us on a – sort of a hypothetical. If there were human rights defender today in Myanmar who suddenly began doing what’s happening to many human rights defenders, receiving threats, being doxed on several platforms, what steps could they realistically actually take to try to protect themselves? And then when you move to the platforms, what are the most urgent types of threats that you see that platforms need to have processes to address when you come from that on-the-ground perspective?
Wai Phyo Myint: Thank you. Thank you so much for having us today. Like, I’m here, you know, not necessarily – not just as a team member of Access Now. I’m also here as a human rights defender from Myanmar. So, just to give you a bit background, you know, for many of you, like, who might not necessarily know well about what is going on in Myanmar, basically, like, currently right now we are – I mean, over three years now people in Myanmar tirelessly resisting military coup, you know, started 1st February 2021.
But on a daily basis, what we have been seeing, like, on the ground for these over three years is this – pretty much, like, people in Myanmar are facing the worst forms of, like, human rights abuse atrocities, you know, committed by the military. So on a daily basis what we have been seen is like airstrikes you know, like, dropping bombs, you know, on these civilians areas, like, the towns. And many of the villages has been literally – like, the whole village has been wiped out, you know, after being burned down. Even, like, this morning, you know, like, when I was on the way, I received the message, you know, like, one township has been basically kind of like now on fire, and their internet has been shut down, and, you know, et cetera.
So those are the kind of, like, a daily basis, you know, what we have seen about both online and offline as well. And also, like, people have been killed, you know, like arbitrary detentions and, you know, et cetera. Those are on a daily basis, you know, we have been seeing. And when you look at about online, so, the same as well. You know, like, internet shutdown has been – military has basically shut down internet since the day one. So currently, right now, when we are speaking, over 80 townships, that’s me, like, almost more or less 1/3rd of the country doesn’t have the internet at all.
So, some of these townships, like, they are around – like, 30 townships are – it has been over two years doesn’t have internet. And also in some areas, they not necessarily just internet and also mobile communication has been – has been shut down as well. And then, like, and also the other side. You know, like a tons of, like, websites – including all these social media and messaging platform, has been blocked. It has been almost three years now. And then even the use of the VPN has been banned in Myanmar. And then, like, at the other side, you know, when you look at about it, the military has been trying to use different tools. They are trying to do abuse or sort of, like, digital tools to be able to extend, you know, like, their surveillance hands, you know?
You will see about it there. Like, they have been abusing, you know, like all sort of data collected from, like, a study from the CCTV footage or even including like SIM card registration, data. Biometric data they collected through these, like, e-ID project, like, a unique ID project and, you know, et cetera. So they have been abusing, you know, like to be able to –all sorts of these data to be able to kind of, like, do, like, a multiple filing to be able to identify these individuals, to be able to trace, you know, where these people are exactly, and then what they are doing, and et cetera. To be able to monitor their online activities, to be able to monitor their financial transaction, you know, like – and all sort of, like, violating all their privacy then, et cetera.
So that is also – we have been seeing on a daily basis as well. And also at the same time, you know, like the military has been kind of actively monitoring you know, all these social media, because, like, even though they banned social media and also messaging platforms and et cetera, people are trying to find a way, you know, to be better connected, and et cetera. But they are still monitoring all these digital footprints happening across different platforms, and doxing people, abusing people. And we have seeing about – literally this was – like, what we have been seeing are a part of kind of, you know, the campaign of terror. You know, that’s what – basically what we are seeing. Properties has been confiscated, you know, people have been arrested, and arbitrary detention has been happened.
And even, like, a killing, like, just, like two weeks ago. You know, one of our close friends was – basically got killed after get out – because she was arrested. And then there was – on that day there was a trial. And then right after the trial, we didn’t get information, you know, where she was taken, and et cetera. And then a few days later on the way back from the court, she – basically, she just got killed. So those kinds of information we have – we are – I mean, basically, kind of, like, you’re seeing on a daily basis. This is the level – you know, the threat level, the roots level about people in Myanmar are experiencing.
And then here we use this, like, “human rights defenders,” you know, the term “human rights defender.” But – thank you, like, our keynote speaker. He also defined it, like, human rights – the term, like, “human rights defender,” as well. But in Myanmar – majority of the people in Myanmar are currently right now, I mean, basically kind of like they are standing up. You know, they are taking the key risks, you know, to be able to defend their rights, to be able to defend the rights of their generation, you know. They basically – so, when we talk about sometimes, you know, like, when we talk about the term of the “human rights defenders” and et cetera, particularly in Myanmar, pretty much like every individuals are human rights defenders. And the risk they are having – the risk, like, the threat level, you know, they are experiencing is pretty much, like, at the same, more or less – the same level, you know. On a daily basis, they are facing it.
Like, for example, you know, even the public school teacher and also the school children, you know, who are boycotting public school system, which is under the control of the military, they refuse to attend the class. They refuse to go back to the public school. They are arrested. They are – many of them have even got killed as well, you know, just for refusing the school system, you know, controlled by the military. This is – this kind of, like, threat level. You don’t necessarily need to be a kind of, like, politician or high-profile human rights. But even on these, like, I mean, students, like, schoolchildren can be basically – you know, have been targeted, you know, and monitored. And their activities have been monitored, and et cetera.
So, the best – sorry, back to the question level. So, I am – I closely work with the local groups, who has been monitoring on the digital rights abuses and, you know, et cetera. So, we closely – this is pretty much like a small group. And that this group also, we have a kind of, like, network with the extended civil societies and, you know, like, labor unions, and the student unions, and, you know, et cetera. So on a daily basis, like, the message we receive is if somebody got arrested from any of these networks, they alert to us, because, like, they want, like, a kind of – you know, their digital footprint, like, their accounts to be taken down, and, you know, et cetera. Like, if that person has a Facebook account, they want to secure the Facebook account, Facebook page, Telegram channel. You know, and even if they have a Gmail, you know, like, they would like to access it.
So, basically, this is the kind of, you know, like, messages, you know, on a daily basis we receive. You know, whoever, like, from this network got arrested, they alert it to us with their URL, you know, sort of, you know, can you please help us, you know, secure these accounts, and et cetera? So, that was – like, we basically kind of, like, collaborate with the others digital rights group, and also Assess Now, and also a helpline, and also collaborate with these, like, different platforms, and et cetera.
So, those are basically kind of, you know, like – I will say about it, like, a step, you know, but not necessarily kind of mitigate the risk. You know, to mitigate the risk mean, like, only we basically kind of, like, took these steps, you know, only after somebody got arrested, we got notified, right? To be mature about it, they are kind of, like, digital communications has been secure and also the network, you know, the involved and, et cetera, are secure, and et cetera. So, those are kind of like the immediate steps that we have to take it, right?
The other one are basically kind of, like, we collaborate, like, our organization and also, like others, the digital rights organization, we closely work. So there, will also work around on the mitigation plan as well. You know, that is also some of what we engage with these different platforms, you know, to make sure about it. Like, we can be able to kind of, like, foresee, you know, what are the risks and what are the mitigation plans to be able to inform these, like, human rights defenders, and also media, journalists, and, you know, et cetera. So basically, those are kind of like a day-to-day work, you know, we have to take. And also this is also, like, lead off, like, a collaboration with these, like, the stakeholders, including the – like, including the platforms as well. Thank you.
Ms. Strucke: Thank you so much for your work, for the work of the human rights defenders that you are in contact with that are facing these conditions every day. It was so powerful hearing what you just said, because you had in it both the fact that authorities block the internet, which is a lifeline to people and means defenders can’t access tools that they need. At the same time, isn’t that an indication of how powerful it is as a tool for human rights defenders? So I heard both of those in your statement.
And then the idea that it’s used – these platforms are used to track and monitor people, I think it really raises a good question for you and for Sheryl about this reporting – these secure and accessible reporting channels. I know it’s extremely complicated because even when someone takes a step to send that message in something that could be monitored, they’re putting themselves at risk. So how – are there lessons that Freedom House and Access Now can share with platforms on the steps that they can take to develop these secure and accessible reporting channels, which will support human rights defenders when they’re facing harms in the places that they’re defending human rights? So maybe I’ll start with Sheryl.
Sheryl Mendez: Sure. I think, you know, one of the steps is to consult and co-create with defenders and others who are affected. That would also speak to accessibility issues, right? So, you know, when a platform understands what the operating environment for a defender is, how they’re able to access any type of channel, but also when they’ve accessed channels in the past to report abuse, or abusive language, or threats, have they gotten a response? You know, defenders and others are trying to understand – and there should be greater education and training – about what is the lifecycle of reporting? What will happen if a defender, or anybody, does report something? You know, what are the stages? What can they expect?
Because often what happens is that defenders and others, you know, they experience what American Bar Association’s Center for Human Rights, and many others, have said is, like, flagging fatigue. You know, so that’s overwhelming. And also, when they’re documenting these threats if there was greater information on how to document threats, what to document. And also across social media platforms and companies, if there was a better kind of, you know, approach where if a defender is attacked, including across multiple platforms, is there a way that the reporting process can be streamlined so that they’re not starting from scratch every single time that they may be, you know, reporting something to one or the other of a channel.
This is also really important, because, as we all know, you know, from both defenders at risk and others, that when something happens offline and then if it goes – when it happens online, and if it goes offline. And if it also leads to the criminalization of defenders or different types of legal harassment because of these, you know, orchestrated campaigns to defame them, discredit them, both in the public eye. You know, when that happens, whether governments or other actors can use that to then bring these frivolous and worse suits against them, or to charge them, or to jail them. You know, which also takes them out of their human rights work. It affects their families. You know, the costs are, you know, extreme. depending on, let’s say, if it’s legal action.
And also, you know, even with legal action, the life of a case, even if something gets dismissed, you know, those costs and the psychosocial impact, you know, is tremendous. And again, it has consequences for their family members and others. I think it’s very important for –with having secure and accessible channels, that people know where the points of contact are, offline and online. Because, for example, there may be defenders who don’t have an online presence, you know, who are still attacked online – whether they’re indigenous defenders or many other defenders.
And if there isn’t an understanding of, like, what are the clear channels? Who are the actual points of contact? You know, if a defender is going to be able to report, then are they able to have contact with human beings, you know, who are trauma-informed, who may be able to give, you know, kind of real-time response or, at least, help them to understand what are the steps, you know? And, again, how they’re documenting, things like that. That also includes the need for resourcing, you know, local and national networks and civil society organizations. And training of trainers. Again, because, you know, with the way one reports and how they document, when defenders and others are going through this entire process and effort, and they’ve already been put under, you know, really difficult psychological strain and stress, and – you know, and threats – you know, every type of threat that’s been described.
You know, defenders are reporting to us when they’re asking for emergency assistance, or to other networks because we don’t work in isolation. You know, a defender is a land, environment, indigenous rights defender, you know, a journalist, et cetera, there are a variety of different networks. But one of the things that we and our partners do, is that we’re trying to bring those networks across, you know, in the same spaces. You know, it’s both for the reason that it’s, you know, it’s very difficult when you’re constantly contacting different types and different sources and all of that for help and to kind of work together to provide support for defenders. But because each one of these areas in the broad diversity of human rights work, you know, it literally is cut and paste.
I mean, I used to work at the Committee to Protect Journalists. When I came into working in more broad on human rights defenders, it was the same thing. It’s, like, they’re using the same tactics, you know, the same approach. Like you’d mentioned, you know, like, it’s the same scenario, except the tools and other things are more insidious, quicker, you know, you name it. But I think it’s also important for social media companies and others, all of us, you know, to understand when defenders take kind of preventative measures or precautionary measures, which includes self-censorship, right? Which includes leaving, you know, including into exile – you know, leaving the human rights field in its entirety sometimes.
And I bring this up because it’s important because that will inform how you, you know, think about safe and accessible secure channels. Because it depends on that – how you respond, you know, what is the manner of response, how quickly or efficiently, you know, and all of that. But if there is no response, then this is what happens. Defenders leave. You know, that’s a problem. And also with their families, because often, as was mentioned, I mean, the families are attacked. You know, they’re threatened with kidnap. You know, and it’s not just threats. Like, we’ve seen, like – I mean, I’ve literally been working in this field, between CPJ and Freedom House, for, like, 12 years or more, right? And, you know, threats of abduction happen. Everything that everybody said, including the keynote speakers and all of that, like, I can name, you know, every single person that we’ve dealt with, and what country, what context, you name it, where these things are happening in, and how it’s evolved in the way – in the way it’s happening as well. As you’d mentioned, you know, the evolution.
One of the other things about accessibility is, you know, including, you know, for example, persons with – sorry – with disabilities, and defenders who are working in this space as well, and other marginalized communities, when you’re thinking about different reporting channels and how a person would access them, you know? And then I would also say that – there was – oh, one of the things that defenders have brought up, you know, and I think it’s really important and I wrote it because I want to make sure that I express this. But they want to understand and they want guidance from social media companies, and protection groups, and all of that, that – for example, if they experience online abuse – hateful speech, et cetera – what do they do if they block speech or they mute speech, you know, or they report threats when they’ve seen, for example, sometimes when they blocked it that threats accelerated or escalated, right?
When they’ve muted it, you know, then they may not have access to something that they need to monitor in order to document and report what’s happening. And then also, you know, when they report threats if they don’t receive a response, you know, then what did they do if, in fact, it takes time and they won’t receive a response in a manner that they would need or in time that they would need? But there could be advice. This is some of the things that you can do, right, along the – along the process. And it’s also again, I mean, about training and resources, because often defenders who are subjected to these type of threats, and hate speech, and things like that, you know, they may need colleagues and other trusted, you know, people, you know, in their networks to monitor these things for them, right?
So they need this kind of education, you know, and these trainings, and trainings of trainers. You know, it’s almost like everything that, you know, Access Now and other groups in the protection landscape – whether they’re frontline defenders or American Bar Association’s justice defenders or many others in all of these different networks – the processes and things that have evolved in these networks, including working collectively, you know, that’s something that social media companies are going down that road. But there’s a lot to learn from what are the lessons from these networks, and particularly at the local and national levels? And also consider when defenders may be not near capitals but are in remote situations, what are the challenges, then? You know, if they’re deep in a context where they may be at risk? You know, so I’ll just – that was a mouthful.
Ms. Strucke: Thank you. I mean, you presented such a rich picture of the tensions that people are facing when they’re trying to report, and the networks that are supporting them. And the kind of common theme I heard was certainly the idea of having common processes from the platforms to be able to understand, well, who’s the point of contact to go to, and online and in person, what do they do? I want to ask Wai if you wanted to add anything to this picture, especially when it comes to what platforms are able to actually do that human rights defenders on the ground need that would help them as they try to do this?
Ms. Myint: Yes. Definitely. I agree with, like, the channels, you know, like, a contact point and et cetera. Those are quite essential. Especially, like, the issues, you know, like, human rights defenders on the ground are kind of, like, changing, you know, like, quite constantly. And also from one country to another, the risk level. And, you know, like it the situations are quite different from one country to another. So, that’s why, like, I mean, kind of, like, the platforms, you know, like, they have a global policy and, you know, like, one policy fit for all. And, you know, et cetera, it doesn’t really work, you know, in reality.
So, like, that’s why, like, we actively encourage, you know, all the platforms to engage with a local – like, a CSO local activist and, you know, to be able to first identify the risk level, and also to be part of the mitigation plan, right? So currently, right now, to be honest, we have even in Myanmar it’s a – I would say about it, like, because we have not necessarily just rearrest, or even, like, a kind of since last decade, you know, we have a number of issues – like a hate speech, you know, like a genocide, and, you know, et cetera. So that’s why, like, we kind of – I will say about it – like, got some sort of, like, international attention, and also attention from these different platforms, and et cetera.
But still, you know, like, I will say, like, we have very few platforms, you know, who are regularly engaging with the CSOs on the ground. So that definitely need to change. And also, the thing is – like, and also the other thing, like, what we have been seeing about it, like, normally what the platform usually do is more about kind of like addressing the kind of, like, threat, you know, like, they are experiencing, the human rights defenders on the grounds are experiencing, et cetera. Oftentimes, you know, we don’t really see that much, you know, like a proactive approach part of this, like, mitigation plan, right? So, that is also definitely the area we would like to see, like, much more progress as well, you know?
And then, like, the other one that even one of the recommendations about, like a change of, like, information, you know, that I hear about it, and also quite key as well. Like, for example, you know, like, we exchange information, you know, often time to time. You know, when we trying to engage with the these different platforms, you know, legal organization, you know, they all – like, who has been monitoring online content and, you know, et cetera, they flash these issues. You know, oh, these are the bad actors. These are the issues. These are the kind of, like, links and, you know, et cetera, right? They say the with the – but they also have a limited capacity as well.
But sometimes, you know, like, at this – the information flow is always kind of, like, one-sided, right? Like, we fill this information in, you know, we get this information in. But oftentimes, you know, we don’t really know where this information is going. It’s literally kind of like a drop in the black hole. And how this information will be kind of, like, get taken into the consideration behind the platforms. You know, how the – how this information will be kind of reflected in the policy change. And, you know, we don’t – we don’t have these kinds of information. And also, often time to time, you know, we don’t really see that kind of, like, reflection as well.
So, and also at the same time, like, they are a lot going on. Like, the different platforms that they have, like, they are kind of, like, investigations and, you know, et cetera. So I think, like, these kinds of, like, exchange information with the CSOs, you know, what they see on the ground and then what the platform are seeing on that their platforms, and, you know, et cetera. These kinds of exchanging information I see about it, it will be, what, like a regular basics of exchanging information would be quite useful, especially for the CSOs who are working on the protection part, like, including digital security, and, you know, physical security, and et cetera.
At least they can foresee, you know, what is going on on the platform as well, who are the bad actors, you know? Sometimes, you know, these bad actors are not necessarily within their own country territory, right? They have links to Russia. They have links to China. You know, they have links to these other countries, and et cetera. This, you know, like a platform have this information, right? So CSOs, local organization who are working on the ground, having this knowledge, having this information is, what, kind of, like, I’ve seen it helpful, you know, in their consideration, in their – like in educating, you know, their network, their public, and et cetera.
So, I will say about it, like, we also would like to see about it, the more kind of, like, a(n) exchange of, like, the information in the future as well. Definitely, like, a regular engagement. I think that’s kind of like a pretty much like solved. Most of can be able to solve, like, most of these issues, yeah.
Ms. Strucke: Well, thank you. I want to definitely get to, you know, some of the really important questions that you’ve raised, and give Alex a chance. If you – maybe you could help walk us through a little bit of, you know, from an example of a platform, how do you look at these reports when they come in? Kind of what do the processes look like when you think of what message you want, you know, human rights defender to hear about how Google does it? And in that sense too, how do you – what factors go into deciding how you kind of structure protection mechanisms? That behind the scenes might be really helpful for people to hear.
Ms. Walden: You know, I know this is something we have long talked about. I think there is a lot more work to be done between the platforms generally and what information sharing mechanisms might look like. There are obviously lots of challenges around privacy, and security, and our ability to validate information before we share it out. But obviously, we know it’s useful to those who are working on the ground. And so certainly lots more opportunity to think about what’s possible in that space.
But sort of just to back up and talk about sort of how we think about these issues and how it sorts of fits into the structure of the company – because, to Jason’s point, like, it’s a big global company with a lot of people and a lot of teams and a lot of product surfaces. And so how do we make sure we’re paying attention to the issues that are coming up in Myanmar, across Latin America, across all regions of the world, right? So, I think, first, it really – like, we do have to focus on security by design.
And that means that our teams that are focused on looking at threats and understanding the threats that are coming at our platforms all day every day are informing how we are building all of our products. Because at base, like, in a perfect world, our – the way that you flag an issue in a product that any user around the world would flag an issue would also solve the problems of our most vulnerable users. And when you design for the most vulnerable users, then you’re also solving problems for everyone. So anyway, that’s sort of why security by design is so important. And I think why when we do that it sort of helps us get a little bit closer to solving these problems.
But obviously, like, in addition to building security into the products at their foundation, we think about what are the specific features that some particularly vulnerable users might need. And so that looks for us like in-product features. Anybody that has Gmail might have received a notice that says: It looks like you might have been targeted. And you’ll get a notice from us that says you may have been targeted. We may not have a lot more information we can share with you, but that’s a flag to someone that they might be being targeted, one. And then we also provide them with some links about ways to check the security on their account, and some other resources. So, making sure that people have resources to do some of those checks themselves.
And then we also spend time thinking about specific products that might be useful to groups that are being targeted online. And so, we have things like the Advanced Protection Program, which is a super secure version of Gmail that lots of – that we sort of have engaged with journalists and rights defender organizations, as well as sort of, like, candidates that are running for office, because we know they are also likely to be attacked. So, making sure that those – that those groups of folks have access to this tool. And it’s not just sort of individual accounts, it’s also sites. And so, we have a program called Project Shield where we provide additional security to sites that might be subject to DDoS attacks or other things like that. So really investing in additional tools that we know people might need.
And then, you know, obviously, engaging with stakeholders is something we have to continue to do to make sure that we are understanding how the threats are evolving. And that needs to feed into the structure, the programs, the process, and the teams across the company that are working on these issues. And that really runs the gamut, again, from engineers and product developers, to trust and safety who are writing the policies and enforcing the policies, and our public policy teams who are doing advocacy around things like fighting internet shutdowns and making sure that there are adequate protections in place around censorship and privacy. So that – sort of companies need a comprehensive approach. And it has to be built into the way you build products, and then also that you have processes and policies in place.
And then, of course, having particular mechanisms for rights defender groups to come directly to your human rights team. Companies should have the human rights team. And when they don’t, that – it doesn’t make it perfect, but I think if you don’t have that, it sort of means that you don’t even have a way for the company to begin to understand how they have a responsibility to address these issues, and kind of just start thinking about how to do that in concert with other stakeholders.
Ms. Strucke: Thank you for that really fascinating answer. And it’s definitely a lot to think about in terms of how big of an issue this is across how many countries, including here in the United States, and how you have to respond.
I wanted to ask Sheryl a little bit about some of this question on kind of, as we’re thinking about what platforms do, need to do, what kinds of teams and human resources they have in place, some of the most dangerous threats to human rights defenders often rely on this coded language or images that basically might bypass detection from automated systems, or even human reviewers who lack the knowledge of local languages, context, slang, symbols – things that people can’t find if they don’t have that very localized information.
So, Sheryl, can you tell us more about how you’ve seen this issue arise in your work with human rights defenders around the world? And then specifically, how can platforms you know, taking what Alex said about needing to communicate more with stakeholders and engage different teams – how can they engage civil society and others with that kind of contextual knowledge to build that up? And then, you know, bring it into, I think, not just the human rights teams but also, as Alex mentioned, people designing products and features for companies?
Ms. Mendez: So coded speech, whether hate speech or otherwise, is very contextual. And one of the things that’s really important, as has been said, is that companies have a physical presence, a field presence, or they also have teams on human rights but also linguistically, teams that understand historical narratives, historical violence, you know, teams who also understand and can monitor political language and political histories, cultural, et cetera. Because one of the things is that – one of the difficulties is when speech doesn’t seem direct, that it’s a direct targeted attack, then often not only it doesn’t get reported, but it’s not seen as something that could lead to offline violence or other types of violence.
And without understanding the local context, without understanding language and how it’s used, you know, and different expressions, you know, or different allusions to – you know, without that then there is an understanding of, like, this is a direct threat. And also, often this use of indirect, you know, types of language – like basically talking about the longevity of a defender’s life, saying that something should be done, wishing that something would, you know, befall them, talking –dehumanizing them. I mean, we’ve had many reports from defenders where they’re basically not considered human, first of all, that they’re a virus, et cetera.
You know, but again, referring back to in some contexts language that’s been used historically during political violence, for example. But also, you know, on language where defenders, you know, it may call into question their gender, you know, language, which also, you know, accuses them of corruption and criminalization, or belonging to different criminal groups and things like that, because that also then leads to threats in the legal sphere, jailing, you know, things like that. But also, on the other part – to your question about how platforms can inform, you know, and build their contextual knowledge. I think the thing is, as has been mentioned, I mean, cross-functional, interdisciplinary, different types of teams.
And also, you know, kind of focusing on an abuser approach. Because defenders – you know, that’ll kind of decrease the burden that’s on defenders for them to flag and – you know, flag content, et cetera. But it also – because of the phenomenon we were talking about earlier, about flag fatigue. You know, so, but I think that, as was mentioned, besides having human rights experts, having, you know, people who are experienced in journalism and political contests, that also helps to unearth some of these type of nuanced threats or coded threats. But also, you know, getting away from these kinds of standard lists of hate speech, right, or certain types of vocabularies that are used. As was said, you know, it’s not a one-size-fits-all.
So, there are different types of known speech that may be considered hate speech or otherwise. But if we just stick to those, then we’re also dealing with speech which might be invisible and not measurable, you know, because we don’t even know it exists. But within the local context, defenders and others do know it exists. And they also constantly flag it. And it’s not seen, again, as, well, that doesn’t really rise to the threat level of a direct threat. But in that context, it does, including, you know, what defenders are called.
In certain contexts, if a defender is called a criminal, you know, or an enemy of the state, or a variety of other things, you know, that is, you know, a means that often these orchestrated or kind of campaigns against them, you know, get activated. And then the Catch-22 is that defenders and others are so overwhelmed by the number of – weather posts or whatever it is – that not – you know, one individual can’t reasonably, you know, handle that, never less report on it. You know, so that’s –
Ms. Strucke: Yeah. Well, thank you. I think you’ve really raised such important points for platforms to consider. And hearing a couple of themes in that. Hearing the need for that very specific human rights defender, localized community-level engagement. And perhaps you’re mentioning with people that are actually marginalized themselves, vulnerable people. I know that even in the U.S. context, you may have a majority group that – like you said, they can list names of common hate speech indicators. But they don’t experience it themselves every single day in a way where they understand exactly what that insinuation means, or exactly what that symbol or kind of allegory or allusion means. So I think that I’m hearing that. And also an opportunity for platforms to look at those patterns in reporting to figure out what is not rising to the level, but maybe is exposing an emerging trend. And that’s something it sounds like they need local people to help navigate. So, yeah, go ahead, Alex.
Ms. Walden: I just wanted to chime in because I think, like, certainly at Google, this is something that we are deeply invested in. We have – our trust and safety team is global. And they are – they do exactly this. They sort of – for our hate speech policy in particular – they are looking at what are hate terms, what are thematic narratives that are coming up in the hate space, and how those evolve, and trying to make sure we have taxonomies that are keeping up with the ways bad actors are dehumanizing and inciting violence, et cetera. So, like, but it is a huge investment for companies. And, you know, I see my colleagues from Meta in the room. Like, they do the same thing.
And I think one of the things we need to think about are ways to resource the diversity of the industry, because it is something that certainly the big companies are invested in – and could improve, but are deeply invested in. But how do we make sure that smaller companies that can have a really big footprint are getting access to this type of – sort of intel from experts about what narratives – what narratives exist and how you should interpret them in a particular context? That takes a lot of people resources that not all companies – in particular, small companies don’t have yet. So I think that’s an important kind of, like, ongoing challenge for the ecosystem.
Mr. Pielemeier: Yeah. Thanks, Michelle.
So, this has been a really, really rich conversation. And I think the question of how do we sort of take this forward and measure progress is a really important one. So GNI has a framework. We’ve been – for 15 years. So we’re a multistakeholder organization. We have tech companies – not just sort of internet companies, but also telecommunications companies, cloud providers, infrastructure providers – all of whom sort of interface with free expression and privacy slightly differently, depending on the products and services they provide. But all of whom have obviously, by virtue of being part of GNI, made a commitment.
And that commitment sort of is broken down in the principles and our implementation guidelines into these kinds of specific measures. And then we have a periodic assessment process that each company goes through. And in that process, that company will bring in an independent third party, which we accredit, to review the steps they’ve taken against each of the categories of obligations, and document that. And they do that by looking at the sort of internal paper trail of, you know, what systems and policies are there. Not just the public-facing ones but the internal ones. They talk to key employees from sort of senior-level management all the way down to the people in the field who are kind of interacting with and dealing with threats on a on a daily basis. And then we look at case studies. So actual examples of how free expression and privacy challenges manifest. And, you know, we place particular focus on the interaction between companies and governments, because that’s where a lot of these threats manifest.
So, all of that goes into a report, which then is shared with our multistakeholder membership for review, discussion, and recommendations. So, we evaluate companies against the benchmark, which is good faith implementation with improvement over time. And this cycle repeats. Recommendations that are provided to the companies then are reviewed at the next assessment in order to make sure that there is progress happening. And so that improvement over time concept, which is also baked into this guidance, I think is really critical. But having a concrete framework and process to be able to measure improvement is really important. And improvement, of course, can mean lots of different things.
I think what’s interesting today is the fact that we are now seeing a number of emerging laws and regulations that are effectively taking a lot of these recommendations and guidance from the U.N. guiding principles, the OECD guidelines, and baking them into hard law. So we have things like the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, which is in the process of, it seems like, passing in the EU. (Laughter.) Which applies to all companies of a certain size with certain presence in Europe, regardless of sector. And that basically is a mandatory human rights due diligence law that will require covered companies to conduct human rights due diligence and demonstrate how they are doing that, how they’re addressing the risks that they uncovered through that.
Then we have tech-specific regulations, like the Digital Services Act, which apply in particular to segments of the technology ecosystem. And there are obligations for all kinds of different companies. But the very largest online service providers and search engines have to go through a pretty rigorous risk assessment process. And they have to have that audited by a third-party auditor. And so there are sort of these elements of the human rights – Business and Human Rights Framework that are now being codified. Which hopefully will mean that not just the very largest providers, many of which are members of GNI who’ve kind of already been doing this through a framework of sort of co-governance, but also the smaller providers, the providers who haven’t committed as much to human rights as a policy or as a practice, will now have to sort of raise their game at least to a sort of minimum level. And over time, hopefully that that floor will rise.
A lot of questions about how this is going to work in practice. We can get into that if you’d like. I do want to say, I think there’s – just taking stock of a lot of the conversation, and knowledge, and experience that’s being shared here. I think when we think about human rights defenders specifically, it may be helpful to kind of understand that there’s sort of two types of defenses, or actions that companies can take to help defend against attacks. Wei Phyo really, I think, poignantly pointed out how in Myanmar basically the entire civilian population has become human rights defenders, right, in one way, shape, or form. And so their individual account actions or not – there’s no way you can sort of do that for every single person using a service in Myanmar.
So that’s where it’s really important to have kind of general corporate practices that can protect against threats. And I think there is none more important in that context than end-to-end encryption, which is, you know, a vital security and privacy measure that, fortunately, we have seen tech companies like Google and Meta taking steps to sort of mainstream across products and services. You really cannot underscore enough how important that can be for not just the sort of explicit human rights defenders, but just everyday people who might find themselves from one day to the next becoming a target.
And, you know, that’s not been – it’s not sort of an obvious thing, because there are a lot of governments and law enforcement agencies who see end-to-end encryption as an obstacle. Not just the authoritarian ones, but even democratic ones. So I want to just underscore that. And I think in general then cybersecurity and information security, security by design measures, right, these are things that can apply across the board addressing threat actors, right? And a lot of companies have been putting time and energy into understanding these threats because they’re not just bad for individual users, but they’re really bad for the product and service if they become, you know, so pervasively influenced by these threat actors.
So that’s the general level. And then we have the kind of specific projects, or programs, or mechanisms that can be made available to people who are known activists and known targets, right? So that’s – like Alex was talking about advanced protection and Project Shield. And there are a bunch of other programs like that. And I think those are – those are really important for these specific actors, but they’re never going to be available, or useful, or even really relevant to the general population.
So I think as we think about measuring progress over time, it’s worth looking at both the kind of systemic sort of efforts that companies can take and how those are progressing and how we’re learning across the industry and across stakeholder groups about their impact, and then the specific measures and how some of those might become not just sort of specific to a particular company and a particular user, but can we kind of think about ways that, across the industry, these protections can be provided more consistently. Because it was pointed out, I think really appropriately, that these threat actors don’t just play in one space, right? And the threats migrate, as do the users, across different platforms.
Ms. Strucke: Thank you. And I appreciate how you talked about both sort of the systemic benchmarking level of companies of their realization of improvements over time, but also, I think, from the kind of activist or on the ground perspective, people can feel quite impatient for that gradual realization to happen. So I also appreciate that you talked about concrete things, and so did Alex, that are proactively happening to be able to address these.
So, in the interest of time, we’ll definitely turn now to some audience Q&A. If you have a question in the room, please raise your hand. I will start with the first one online and that way it gives you also time for more people to raise their hands because they know sometimes there’s a first-person effect of someone’s being shy. So I’ll start with a question from online that we received.
You know, is there anything specifically around gendered online harms that’s recommended? Especially given the outsize harm faced by women human rights defenders? And the U.S. also just launched the National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights. And I also heard people discussing the fact that again, gender, isn’t kind of specifically called out. Obviously, there’s many vulnerabilities that would cause a person to be – have this outsized harm, and gender is just one of them. But I was curious if there’s any, you know, anything specific on gender that anyone wanted to share about the guidance that could be applied to platforms?
Ms. Mendez: I think, considering when someone is attacked because of their gender, also, that they may be attacked because of their families, or their families may be attacked. What are the protective mechanisms that already exist, for example, through social movements, you know, that work for the protection of women and other marginalized defenders who may be attacked because of their gender, or because of hate speech, remarking about their gender, or otherwise? So I think that these – that it’s really important to look at, like, who is working within this area. Because they’ve also had a lot of experience on what, you know, gender-specific attacks, and threats, and protection, and mitigation, and all that, looks like.
Because it’s also not something new. I mean, women and women who identify – people who identify as women and others who are marginalized, you know, a lot of this is already down the road quite a way. You know, but again, you know, the threat actors are using different means to go after them. And in many cases, they go after their families. And on support, you know, like, let’s say, if somebody needed to relocate for their safety because of threats, often some protection measures don’t work because it doesn’t consider their family or other people around them who may be at risk. But also, you know, protection also includes when someone may be at risk from their family, because the impact of threats on them, or from their community, or otherwise.
Ms. Strucke: Thank you. And I think it’s really important for, as we’re discussing this, as people think about the fact that these threats can emanate, you know, unlike in a physical threat where someone’s right in front of you, from really anywhere. And they can affect people that are in the person’s family and network, in addition to themselves. So thank you. Those are great points.
Ms. Mendez: Sorry. I would just also add the psychosocial impact. You know, because often, you know, the threats also speak to denigrating the person, you know, and their reputation, and calling – you know, for example, if it’s threats against a woman, calling into question, you know, her womanhood, or being a mother, or otherwise. So, again, I think psychosocial – both in remedy, in responding and understanding the impact that this has on a person besides the fact that they may, you know, not be able to navigate online or otherwise because of threats. But just, like, literally from, like, every sphere close to a person – themselves, their family, friends, like how it goes out, their society, et cetera – how this may impact those different relations, and how they can navigate, including offline in the physical world.
Ms. Strucke: Well, thank you.
I’ll turn to an audience question. Please identify yourself and ask your question. I’ll start with you. And take a microphone from Elliot. Thanks.
Q: Lisa Poggiali from USAID. Thank you so much for this panel. It’s been really wonderful, and instructive, and rich set of conversations. And really excited about the guidance as well.
I wanted to go back to something that, Sheryl, you said earlier, which really struck me, about the lack of coordination between platforms on the ground and how that affects human rights defenders. I’ve been traveling to different contexts over the course of the past year, and it’s struck me that in certain spaces civil society organizations will say, oh, we have a great relationship with YouTube. We have direct channels. But Meta we can’t get on the phone for anything. And in other places, it’s like, oh, we can talk to, you know, TikTok, but, you know, we can’t talk to Google, or whomever it is.
And so, the, the lack of sort of coordination in different spaces is just so apparent. and across different geographies. And, to Jason’s point about, you know, when there isn’t coordination then threat actors will just migrate. And so, the threats will migrate to the platforms where there’s the least amount of protection. So, the question being really for Alex mostly, is to what extent are there conversations being had among different platforms about generating some kind of more streamlined approach? And also, to the point about resourcing, right, it seems like that would be smarter from a resourcing perspective to cooperate with one another on the ground. And what are some of the barriers that you see to that happening?
Ms. Walden: So I think – so there’s a lot of conversation that happens among the companies, in particular the GNI companies, around how do we learn from one another’s best practices about how we’re engaging with intermediary organizations and with organizations on the ground, sort of, in particular localities or globally, and what programs we have to do that, and kind of, you know, our best practices around implementing those internal guidelines.
Some of the things, I think, that are ultimately, like, some of the barriers to more coordination are the platforms aren’t necessarily similarly situated in any given country, right? So, the user base, the company’s sort of market share, et cetera, all those things look really different. And then the way people are using our platforms can look different. And so, we won’t always sort of have the same amount of resources, or energy, or approach to put into something at a given time. And obviously, as we’ve talked about, like, that can certainly evolve.
And things that might be a priority at one time might become less of a priority as the situation changes, or as our user base changes somewhere. But that just is the reality of how and why it might look different for different companies in a particular country, because our services just aren’t being used in the same way. And so, our approach to managing the issues might look a little bit different.
Ms. Strucke: Well, thanks. We are unfortunately at time for this. And I want to let you all get out of here. I felt a palpable sense in the room of how many questions I think we wished we could have asked. I have definitely a few more here online. I want to thank all of our panelists for all the work they’re doing from each place they sit in advocating for greater protections for human rights defenders. I want to thank the State Department for releasing these really incredible, concrete recommendations for online platforms for protecting human rights defenders. And of course, to thank the Atlantic Council and Access Now as well for their support and partnership of this.
We will be continuing these conversations. These are important topics. So you can always contact us at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. We’re the Human Rights Initiative, if you want to see more of this kind of content, if you have more questions. But it’s certainly an important issue that affects people from the bottom all the way to the top of our society in terms of decision makers and those that are on the frontlines of fighting for human rights. So thank you, again, for coming today. Please join me in thanking our panelists and our keynote speakers for a great session. (Applause.)

54,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/scaling-ai-enabled-capabilities-dod-government-and-industry-perspectives,Unknown,"March 28, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS event hosted on March 26, 2024. Watch the full video here.
Gregory C. Allen: Good morning. I’m Gregory Allen, the director of the Wadhwani Center for AI and Advanced Technologies here at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, CSIS. Today we have an event covering ongoing efforts to scale AI adoption in the Department of Defense and we’re joined by two of the leaders in this effort from the office of the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence officer, the CDAO organization.
To my right is Navy Captain Xavier Lugo, who is a division chief in the algorithmic warfare group at – for artificial intelligence and scaffolding and integration at CDAO. And he’s also the commander of Task Force Lima, which is the DOD’s task force related to generative AI adoption.
And then to my left we have Air Force Colonel Matthew Strohmeyer, who is the combined joint all-domain command and control experimentation division chief at the CDAO.
Gentlemen, thank you for joining me today.
Colonel Matthew D. Strohmeyer: Thanks, Greg.
Mr. Allen: Just before we get into the actual meat of the panel I’d like to know a little bit more about you two and how you got into military AI.
So Captain Lugo, could we start with you?
Captain M. Xavier Lugo: Sure. So I’ve been in the Navy for 30 years, close to, this March – coming March and I’m a supply officer – a logistics officer so basically been dealing with data throughout my whole career.
I’m a mechanical engineer by degree so been always interested in the fusion of those two, right, of engineering and data. As I’ve been progressing through my career, I finally ended up right before this tour on modernizing the logistic IT systems for the Navy within OPNAV, taking over 200 legacy systems and combining them into brand-new technologies and capability-based technologies which include, of course, data centricity, artificial intelligence, analytics.
From there, I was given the opportunity to join what was then the JAIC.
Mr. Allen: The Joint Artificial Intelligence Center.
Capt. Lugo: Yes. And then for – I was a JAIC-ster for about 30 days and then we converted into the CDAO, which now, obviously, I’m in this field. I’m also an ops research analyst. So it all merged. That combined with the experience of data and analytics.
Mr. Allen: Great.
Capt. Lugo: So I could go into more detail but that’s a good summary.
Mr. Allen: This is a common phenomenon. The operations research – the ORSA community is a lot of the data crunching community within the military services and there’s a lot of overlap between that community and the AI and machine learning community.
Capt. Lugo: Absolutely. Yes.
Mr. Allen: Great.
Captain Strohmeyer, you.
Col. Strohmeyer: Greg, good morning. Thank you so much for the opportunity to be here and thank you to CSIS for this platform to allow OSD and CDAO really to kind of get our message out and let the public know about what we’re doing.
So I’m a 23-year Air Force active duty colonel. I started my time as a fighter pilot in the Air Force but then transitioned over into the military strategy and kind of operational war plan planning world and doing that out in the Indo-Pacific and other places across the globe, and eventually landed at NORAD and U.S. NORTHCOM and there was directed by the commander to try to accelerate the modernization of the homeland defense capabilities that NORAD and NORTHCOM were focusing on but to use a new approach – instead of to use kind of the traditional requirements approach, still a very important part of what we do, but to use – because a lot of our homeland defense capabilities needed to be modernized in terms of their data, in terms of how we got sensor data, how we got data about where our operational forces were to be able to defend the homeland, we use an experimentation approach to be able to do that.
And so I started leading a series of experiments when I was at NORAD and NORTHCOM that became known eventually as the GIDE, or Global Information Dominance Experiments, and the approach then was very different in the sense that rather than trying to, you know, go about every 12 to 18 months and do an exercise, which we normally do, instead to take this rapid iterative failure-seeking approach to try to field capabilities rapidly.
And so in this – in the context of starting GIDE and building up that capability we really started, one, to gather the data that we needed for homeland defense but then we also started working with AI-based capabilities to allow us to use that data better to gain more insights on how we can defend the homeland better, how we can better understand what our adversaries are doing, sort of partnering with organizations like Project Maven originally at USD(I&S), now at NGA, and then that eventually morphed into GIDE being brought up to the deputy secretary of defense level and now being run up at CDAO for Secretary Hicks.
And so that’s what I do now is I run that GIDE series of experiments up at OSD.
Mr. Allen: That’s great. And let’s keep talking about GIDE because that’s one of the more interesting things going on anywhere in the DOD right now in terms of accelerating AI adoption.
So you changed jobs but kept working on the GIDE series.
Col. Strohmeyer: That’s right.
Mr. Allen: And can you just help us understand what problem exactly was GIDE created to solve and what is the mechanism by which it seeks to solve that problem?
Col. Strohmeyer: Yeah. Really good question.
So GIDE really started as an accelerant to be able to move at least NORAD and NORTHCOM originally but now really to move the entire Department of Defense to modernize a lot of our capabilities when it comes to data, when it comes to the way that we make decisions.
So, broadly, I would say that GIDE was designed to help us realize decision advantage for the U.S. Department of Defense against any competitors or adversaries.
What do I mean by that? I mean, the way that we, whether it’s at the strategic level if we’re trying to decide should we move this carrier strike group here or should we move these munitions here or how can we create a deterrent effect against our adversaries at the strategic level to be able to get to that decision in a better, faster, more data-informed way and then – but below that at the I would call the operational level, the way that we make, for example, fires decisions.
That’s how we would, for example, complete a kill chain against an adversary, allowing us to be able to do that as well – that work of whether it’s a maritime strike munition going into a maritime target, or whether it’s a land attack munition going into a land territory, or a space or a cyber effect, being able to close those kill chains better and faster than we’ve been able to do in the past and, importantly, in a more joint way than what we’ve been able to do in the past.
The services do a great job of being able to close their kill chains. Our job is to try to bring that together in a more joint way so the services have their data in common and can make joint decisions together.
And so that’s essentially the thing that GIDE was created to be able to do, first at a combatant command level and now at a Department of Defense level. And the other thing I’d say related to it is the approach that it takes is different in the sense that a normal way that the Department of Defense would ready our forces or test our capability would be via an exercise series.
The exercises are very important but they are on a 12- to 18-month timeline and so the learning that you accomplish in an exercise has a really long feedback loop. Important feedback loop, but it’s long.
Under the GIDE series under the direction of Secretary Hicks she has us conducting a GIDE experiment every 90 days and so we essentially go from lessons observed, lessons learned, and lessons applied not only within a 24-hour cycle during a GIDE but then every 90 days outside of those GIDEs.
So it’s a new way for the department to be able to rapidly learn lessons and turn those lessons into fielded capabilities.
Mr. Allen: And when most military service members are changing jobs every two years, right, that’s the difference between going through one exercise in your current term –
Col. Strohmeyer: Absolutely
Mr. Allen: – and eight, you know, GIDE series.
Col. Strohmeyer: Absolutely. Yes.
Mr. Allen: So recently Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks stated that the minimum viable capability for CJADC2 is real and ready now, and I know this is in your title. It’s a critical part of what GIDE is trying to accomplish.
So what exactly did Deputy Secretary Hicks mean when she said it’s real and viable now and what role did GIDE have in making that happen?
Col. Strohmeyer: Yeah. Great question, Greg.
If I can unpack first what is CJADC2. For a lot of the listeners –
Mr. Allen: Mmm hmm. Sure.
Col. Strohmeyer: – they might say that’s a very jargony military term – what does that mean?
So it stands for Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control. Essentially, it is warfighting for the 21st century as opposed to in the past where we had to have each individual service conducting individual service decisions about how we move forces, how we employ those forces.
CJADC2 is a way of – it’s not a single thing we buy but it’s a way of warfighting where we connect the entire joint force together, connect the data across the joint force, connect the decision-making systems across the joint force so that we can make better, faster, more risk- and data-informed decisions, essentially.
So in the context of that and in context of CJADC2 and this capability that the department has been seeking after fielding we – the deputy secretary about a month ago in a very historic announcement at the CDAO symposium said that we had fielded a minimum viable capability for CJADC2 via the GIDE series last year.
So how do we go from experiments to actual fielding of some level of capabilities? Well, the GIDE series – last year we did GIDE V, VI, VII, and VIII. It was the first number of the GIDE series that were done not just at a combatant command level but at the Department of Defense level both with the combatant commands with many of our allies and with the Joint Staff also involved.
And so we went through a process of learning from GIDE V through GIDE VIII that started with GIDE V asking a question can we conduct joint force experimentation to field things at scale across the department. We learned yes, we can do that.
And then GIDE VI and VII really looked to refine the thing that we were trying to field or this heterogeneous mix of things that we were trying to field to be able to get a(n) actual JADC2 capability out into the field.
And then GIDE VIII was really our delivery event where we said did we actually – were we able to successfully deliver something that warfighter said yes, this is helping me – this is helping the things I need to do every day, and we fielded that across two mission threads that I can go into later if you’re interested.
Mr. Allen: That’s great. And one final question on this topic. You know, when you say that there’s a delivery event in GIDE VIII, you know, we’re talking about the valley of death in the Department of Defense, which is this legendary problem set whereby sometimes in exercises, sometimes in research and development environments, really exciting capabilities are demonstrated and as you said, warfighters say, I want that.
But how does that get translated into the actual bureaucratic machinery of the Pentagon for, you know, man, train and equip and sustain? Is the GIDE capability delivery that you’ve achieved is that now translated into permanent programs of record or permanent sustainment activities or permanent COCOM acquisition activities? Or what’s the story there?
Col. Strohmeyer: Yeah. Another really, really good question.
So, one, we think that the way that CJADC2 will continually and iteratively be fielded will look different than a normal program. This is not hardware. This is mainly software and data connected to hardware and connected to warfighters, and the way that we are going about it is different in the process that we’re using.
One, we recognize that whereas you might have a piece of hardware that you research, you develop the requirements for, you acquire it, you send it out to the force with all the DOTMLPF, the training that would need to go with it.
With JADC2 it’s different. Rather than having one organization that researches, develops the requirements, acquires it, and then gives it to all the users we want to have a much more warfighter involved process with it in the sense that we want to have – and this is what we did last year during the GIDE series – we have software engineers sitting directly by warfighters at combatant commands, at subordinate echelons below them, at the Joint Staff, and when they go through a GIDE experiment the warfighter is giving direct feedback literally next to them to the engineer and saying, this is what works, this is what doesn’t work, this is really what I need to accomplish.
So both they can get that feedback but then the engineer can actually live and see this is the result of the work – the coding work that I did. This is how it’s impacting that warfighter. That’s kind of core to what we’re doing.
So that iterative process is very central to what we’re doing to be able to field the capability. But CDAO is also uniquely given the responsibility of being a principal staff agency responsible, right, to the deputy secretary of defense and also having a lot of those capabilities inherent in us to be able to acquire those things, to be able to have organizations that can start to look a little bit like a program office to be able to make this a reality. And I was very glad to get the appropriations bill passed through this weekend so that we can now start moving out at scale to allow CDAO to be able to do that.
Mr. Allen: A tremendous amount there that I could continue talking all day.
But I want to bring in Captain Lugo here because you’re leading not just one but two of the most exciting initiatives, and whereas Colonel Strohmeyer is closer to the combatant command and the adoption side of the equation you have two efforts that are a little bit closer to the development and the creation side of the equation and that is Alpha 1, which is intimately related to the AI scaffolding initiative, and then Task Force Lima, which is related to the department’s adoption of generative AI.
I want to start with Alpha 1. This is now in the FY ’25 budget request. There’s some public language around what the DOD is trying to accomplish with Alpha 1 but I think most people are probably hearing about it for the first time. So what exactly is this initiative and what’s it trying to accomplish?
Capt. Lugo: So it was great that you started with him because he is showing exactly part of the reason why Alpha 1 exists, right? So, first of all, as Nomad mentioned, we – the CDAO has some unique missions that are not typical to other PSAs that overlap with some traditional program office type efforts, right?
So as GIDE goes on one of the things that they noticed is, you know, there’s some sustainment that has to go on with those initiatives, right, and there’s certain gaps in the enterprise that have to be filled especially in the AI/ML world, right, which is really where the algorithmic warfare and subsequently where Alpha 1 resides.
So what Alpha 1 is, is it’s really a portfolio. It’s not a platform. It’s a portfolio of capabilities and services that will enable AI/ML scaffolding at scale on the enterprise. So as mentioned, it’s been resourced for the first time this year. So it’s – but we’ve been doing all the planning efforts so that –
Mr. Allen: When you say resourced for the first time are you referring to the FY ’25 request or the FY ’24 this bill that was just passed?
Capt. Lugo: The bill that just got passed, right? So and we have – our plans are basically to go through capabilities that, again, are required at the enterprise level and what I mean with that is we’re not building the whole AI/ML scaffolding loop at once and then hope for people to join it.
What we’re doing is we’re finding what those most demanded areas are whether it is by the services, by program offices, by experimentation that chose these requirements and fielding those in a priority order as needed.
So that does two things. One of them is it targets the most important needs at that moment and it also gets enough time for capabilities to join when they’re most refreshed in the industrial world. So –
Mr. Allen: So who is –
Capt. Lugo: Yeah.
Mr. Allen: Just in the model that you just described you’re talking about providing the services the sort of portfolio of services that folks who are trying to develop AI capabilities or autonomy capabilities want. But who is your customer in that sense within the DOD environment?
Capt. Lugo: Yeah. So let me – I’ll answer that two ways. One of them is the customer is really not so much the COCOMs yet but mostly services and specific program offices.
Mr. Allen: Interesting.
Capt. Lugo: OK. But let me go via example, right? So the first capability that we have made available is data labeling. So data labeling was found to be a huge gap across the department and in the sense of program offices that were very mature, already had their own data labeling services, but that came with constraints and caveats.
So, for example, the data was not necessarily owned or wasn’t necessarily shared or ability to share that data. That’s one of them. Other pieces are that the tools were not really standardized or interoperable.
So by doing a centralized – centralized is a loaded term. By doing a – at scale –
Mr. Allen: It’s centralized, but it’s not a compulsory centralization.
Capt. Lugo: Right. Right.
Mr. Allen: It’s a(n) optional centralization –
Capt. Lugo: Well, it’s centralized from the perspective of the service is available centrally, but it’s not centralized as a push to anybody to use.
Mr. Allen: Yeah. There’s no “thou shalt” in this story. Right. Yeah.
Capt. Lugo: Correct. So but by doing this – for example, three programs that are transitioning right now which are Smart Sensor, Maritime Object Detection, and Harbinger – Smart Sensor transitioned to the Marine Corps, MOD is a Coast Guard program, and Harbinger is a Navy program – those three are now part of the data labeling service and we provide data labeling as a service to those three programs.
They don’t have to worry about it. They don’t – so now the program office really what needs to be worried about is building models and integrating those models into the weapon systems.
Another example was those were programs that were part of the JAIC actually in the beginning and now they’re transitioning to the services. But the Army came in with Army Project Linchpin and they said, we like that model. We want to be part of that model. And basically we accelerated them from their milestone schedule from 18 months to two years into starting with the capability of data labeling just because it’s available now as a service to the DOD.
Mr. Allen: Just to make sure I understand you correctly here, you know, data labeling is critical to anytime you’re doing most categories in machine learning, especially supervised machine learning.
Capt. Lugo: Correct.
Mr. Allen: It’s foundational to doing that. And what you’re saying is the previous state was the DOD had all these programs of record. They were all instructed or excited to do AI and they all ran into the same challenge of data labeling, and they went and solved it their own way for their own sort of immediate needs and there was this missing economies of scale and standardization because they didn’t necessarily have the expertise to write the contract, they didn’t necessarily have the expertise to run the data labeling effort correctly, and you now provide that as a service.
Capt. Lugo: Not only that, I can level load the capacity, right? So if a program thought they needed a certain amount of labeling services and now they need more or they need less I can level load that as an economy of scale versus either wasting or stoppage at a certain program. So that’s just one example.
Mr. Allen: You allocate across this, you know, portfolio of customers. Yeah.
Capt. Lugo: We can allocate as necessary, right? And I’m not limited as to how many I can onboard, right? So, again, there’s a lot of agility there. So now as we’re going into other lines of effort like, for example, autonomy now we’re able to onboard those into this same labeling as a service for – I don’t want to call it contract service. And then by doing that they have a(n) instant on that they can go in and join.
So that’s just one example of the whole AI/ML DevSecOps. We got other pieces with containerization. We got other pieces also with the actual instrumenting of models, the model repositories, also data management platforms.
All of those services are going to be interoperable – that’s the key here – and available so that program office has much as they need or as little as they need. They can go in and just join into the – into Alpha 1.
Mr. Allen: So is it fair to say that, you know, your mission, loosely defined, is to make life easier for program offices who want to do AI or add AI?
Capt. Lugo: Correct, and easier in the sense of agility, also easier in the sense of resourcing and lessons learned. So and also best of breeds, right? So, and again, we’re not prescribing any particular technology.
We’re not prescribing any particular standard. All we ask is that your data is available for everybody and that you’re interoperable so don’t come up with a customized way. Then it won’t fit into the Alpha 1 program.
Mr. Allen: So some terms that we’ve heard from the CDAO including at the recent CDA symposium are things like AI scaffolding and the data mesh, and could you just sort of explain, you know, number one, those terms? What do they mean?
You’ve already explained a little bit about AI scaffolding in particular. And then what is the overlap with Alpha 1? Is Alpha 1 a synonym for what the CDAO is doing in AI scaffolding or is it one part of it?
Capt. Lugo: So let me first start with data mesh. First of all, neither one – we both play in the data mesh but we don’t own the data mesh. The data mesh is part of the policy arm of CDAO.
However, what it is, is really it’s all about the interoperability and the transparency of the data. That’s really what it is, and the transport of that data across. So, obviously, GIDE and JADC2 is very much, I would say, the reason you need a data mesh.
Alpha 1 or AI/ML scaffolding is leveraging the data mesh in order for us to make the data available across all these program offices without having to centralize the data necessarily but be able to reach the data where it’s at in authoritative sources.
So that’s my simplistic way of describing the mesh.
Mr. Allen: Well, can I just – I want to sort of understand the strategic logic underpinning the data mesh and here’s what I think I’ve heard you say.
So CDAO is going to be providing some resources to organizations that want to do things like data labeling through Alpha 1 but a condition of accessing that resources is that you have to make your data under a standardized format and you have to make it available to the broader DOD. Is that right?
Capt. Lungo: So I got to be careful with the word standardized. This is not about standardized formats. It’s about being able to have your – you got to have ontologies that are accurate so we can actually –
Mr. Allen: So it’s not standardization so much as clarity and transparency?
Capt. Lugo: Correct. Yes.
Mr. Allen: Got it. So they have to make their datasets transparent and accessible to the broader DOD and then that’s going to start sort of its own rock rolling down a hill in terms of gathering momentum because as more and more programs use Alpha 1 then more and more of the attractive portion of Alpha 1 is going to come from accessing this data mesh versus accessing money from CDAO. Is that fair to say?
Capt. Lugo: Yes, that’s fair to say and you can expand data now to models and other pieces of services, right, and other tools, right? So –
Mr. Allen: Right. So you’re starting with data labeling –
Capt. Lugo: Correct.
Mr. Allen: – but that’s only the first set of tools that folks are going to get when they partner with Alpha 1?
Capt. Lugo: That’s Correct.
Mr. Allen: And it seems like, you know, because those three efforts that you mentioned – Harbinger, Smart Sensor, and Maritime Object Detection – obviously, they’re in partnership with other parts of the DOD but they sort of have their origins in those partnerships with CDAO.
Specifically, Linchpin is a major Army program of record and this partnership seems really important to CDAO and Alpha 1 is kind of at the heart of that partnership. Could you sort of elaborate a bit on the state there?
Capt. Lugo: Correct. So their timing was perfect, right? So as they’re briefing Linchpin, Alpha 1 is also being kind of designed. And so they saw the opportunity, we saw the opportunity, to partner and basically, well, we’re going to be providing this – these as a service. Why don’t you take advantage of it and then also then – they’re a PEO so they have multiple programs under that.
So now they’re going to be providing basically data labeling as a service through Alpha 1 to their Army program offices and what that did was just because we were a little bit ahead of them, not necessarily any other reason, right, programmatically – and I think Nomad talked about that – the traditional POM cycle and the traditional way of planning – we had the advantage of providing this quicker to them.
So now instead of them having to wait for a particular milestone to start providing that service it’s probably the – there’s going to be label data. There is already. Labeled data is going to be available at the point where the program office that has got the weapon system ready to receive that data versus being more serial.
So that is a –
Mr. Allen: So this is a path for you to over the longer term get plugged into a lot of program offices across the Army, you know, starting with the Linchpin Program executive office but really –
Capt. Lugo: Correct.
Mr. Allen: – Army is getting direction to utilize Linchpin where possible for AI, inject it into programs of record or creating the programs of record, and now CDAO is going to be a part of that journey.
Capt. Lugo: Absolutely. And we can take that model and expand it to others.
Now, still, like, with everything Alpha 1 really what it is, is about getting the AI/ML scaffolding across – you asked me and I didn’t answer yet what is the difference, right? So the AI/ML scaffolding really is about – the term scaffolding is appropriate because it’s about having the proper safeguards, the proper guardrails, the proper systems for AI/ML to actually flourish and be built.
We are not building models. Again, let the person that owns the problem own the solution as well, right?
Mr. Allen: The program of record and industry partners will build the model.
Capt. Lugo: Or the COCOM or whoever needs – whoever needs that solution, again, just like Nomad described, you got that soldier or sailor or Marine or airman right there coding or telling the coder what to do, right, because they own the problem set. They’re the best equipped to solve that problem.
But what they need is the tools. What they need is the scaffolding to make sure that those tools meet all our other requirements, right? We haven’t talked about the bad side of AI, right – the actual, you know, risks that may be out there. When you have the right scaffolding we take care of at least assisting and so that those risks are mitigated.
Mr. Allen: Mitigated. Yeah.
Capt. Lugo: Correct. And then you get agility. Then you get the speed that you need to solve those problems. So that’s the intent. So are they analogous? No. Alpha 1, again, is that portfolio to –
Mr. Allen: And Alpha 1 is sort of the tip of the spear of the larger AI scaffolding.
Capt. Lugo: Correct. The AI/ML scaffolding is larger than Alpha 1.
Mr. Allen: Got it.
Capt. Lugo: But Alpha 1 is the one that is starting to get momentum to enable – to start enabling AI/ML scaffolding. We do have platforms out there that are already part of AI/ML scaffolding and they have their own way of mitigating those risks and ensuring capabilities are produced.
Mr. Allen: So, Colonel Strohmeyer, we just heard, you know, that GIDE is also a part of the data mesh story and also a part of the AI scaffolding story and potentially even, you know, poised to benefit from Alpha 1 sooner or later. Could you just elaborate a little bit about how GIDE fits into those ideas?
Col. Strohmeyer: Yeah. Great question. So I’ll answer it first in terms of the relationship with Task Force Lima Alpha 1. GIDE really is an experimentation venue with warfighters for those capabilities.
So as they work to build out the enterprise capability for AI and allowing new AI capabilities coming in from services GIDE provides a venue to then experiment with a warfighting mission on one of those capabilities.
So a good example of this is we just finished up GIDE IX last week and during it we did a single blind test with multiple combatant commands of an AI capability to be able to take logistics warfighting workflows that we have to go through – for example, analyzing what a good vehicle or means might be to be able to get some sustainment capability from one location to another location – and the participants were required to be able to generate in a very short period of time what is a normal thing for a J-4, so an actual logistics leader, to generate, what is their recommended path that they would take.
And then some of them had access to a generative AI tool that allowed them to do that but it allowed them to do it in a way that they could see where it was generating information to make sure it wasn’t hallucinating – you can check sources – and then the other team did not. And so that was our single blind kind of test and –
Mr. Allen: You ran it side by side the competition –
Col. Strohmeyer: Side by side. Yeah, exactly.
Mr. Allen: – with generative AI, without generative AI.
Col. Strohmeyer: And the difference was this wasn’t, like, you know, research organizations. This was actual warfighters that were doing this, you know, and seeing what worked, what didn’t work as they went through the process.
So that’s one example of how we’re really partnering with them to get very quick results and to show are we actually testing these things appropriately – are they actually being effective.
Mr. Allen: That’s on the Task Force Lima part, correct? Yeah.
Col. Strohmeyer: Correct. That’s on the Task Force Lima front. We’re looking forward to the – as Alpha 1 scales up this year to start working with them on a lot of those capabilities, bringing those in, because we are partnering with the services and allowing us to be able to test out those capabilities.
Regarding to your question about data mesh and the way that at least on the GIDE side how we are working with warfighters to use those – what we call data mesh services we really view it as two levels.
So the first level what I would call, like, the strategic level one of our missions that we are trying to accomplish there is something we call global integration, the ability for combatant commands and the Joint Staff to have their data in common and to make decisions that are truly globally informed.
If we want to move forces from one location to another they’re not just moving it because somebody requested those forces but because we want to create a global effect by moving those forces. And so bringing all those combatant commands together.
Under that mission, for example, the data mesh services that we are trying to bring to bear allow us to be able to have data in common between the combatant commands so that one combatant command doesn’t have their kind of program of record that they’re working with that has data in a stovepipe and they may have, for example, some logistics data or munitions data that is relative to that force that they have.
Well, in the past that data wasn’t viewable by another combatant command. But now, because we’re trying to truly globally integrate everything we do, a data mesh service in this case that we are working with allows us to have – that piece of data is shared by all the combatant commands, and not just shared via an email or something.
It’s shared live. So they have live access to that data and if one of the combatant commands moves a force it’s represented in that same piece of data for that other combatant command and also available at the Joint Staff. And so that is at that level how we’re using data mesh services to allow us to be able to get better access to data.
The next level for us is what we would say at the operational or tactical level. This is where we really start to overlap with the services where if we’re going to conduct a joint fire mission to be able to close the kill chain the data mesh services there look a little bit different because whereas at the strategic level it’s enterprise level data. It’s usually all available in the cloud.
When it comes to operational and tactical data and decisions that data needs to be highly resilient. It needs to be able to operate in a forward environment and in an environment where it may be contested, where the electromagnetic spectrum may be contested or our access to cloud may be contested.
And so we are using data mesh services for their – like, the joint operating system we just tested it out in GIDE IX to really good effect where we had multiple nodes of data. So rather than a hub and spoke technique of having our data available via a cloud hub and then a spoke at the edge we had a true data mesh deployed where all of the data that was used for those warfighting fires decisions existed on every node and the nodes were intelligently routing the data across this kind of mesh network so that if a piece of that mesh went down it didn’t matter.
The data would resiliently repopulate across the mesh and be able to get that information wherever it needed to go at whatever time, and we tested it to really good effect partnering with the Army at Project Convergence Capstone 4 just about two weeks ago.
Mr. Allen: That’s great. And, you know, you’re talking about the data mesh as it exists at the strategic level, at the tactical level, but really in the operational sort of COCOM-driven world.
But there’s this also aspect of the data mesh and how it exists in the development community, those who are actually creating the capabilities, and to me it seems really important that the data from the operational community be made available to those who are developing the next round of AI models because if you don’t have training data you’re not going to – you know, your machine learning models aren’t going to learn anything without that training data.
So how far along are you in that journey of the actual data that is collected during GIDE actually feeding into the development of the next round of AI models or whatever it may be?
Col. Strohmeyer: And so I think we are on our way. We have a long ways to go. We did successfully just demonstrate in this last GIDE for the first time ever a completely vendor-agnostic data integration layer that allowed us to be able to bring that data down. It didn’t matter what vendor was using it, how they were using it.
That data was created and was extensible across any of the operational systems that we’re using and now it is ready to start piping over into the development pipeline into Alpha 1 and other capabilities so that we can start learning on it at scale as an enterprise.
So that’s one of the things we really want to get after this year is to start making that pipeline permanent, persistent, and real so we can start training those models.
Mr. Allen: That’s great.
And then, Captain Lugo, I wanted to ask you to sort of react to something that Margaret Palmieri, the deputy CDAO at the DOD, said. She said that – earlier this year that CDAO was working to create, quote, “an AI data hub as part of Replicator.”
Can you help us understand, you know, what role your team plays in the Replicator initiative and autonomy efforts, more broadly?
Capt. Lugo: So Alpha 1 has three lines of effort under it. One of them is what we call traditional AI, right? You referenced to that, you know, the typical way that, for example –
Mr. Allen: Supervised machine learning and –
Capt. Lugo: And computer vision and that kind of – that’s line of effort number one. Line of effort number two is generative AI which when we start talking about Lima we’ll – I’ll address that one.
And then line of effort number three is autonomy. The autonomy line of effort is basically AI/ML scaffolding for autonomy. We’re starting to coin now autonomy scaffolding. It’s to support all autonomy projects in the DOD. Replicator happens to be one of them, right? But really because of the need versus maturity – the line of effort number one is the most mature.
Line of effort number two is the one we’re still working with, the generative AI one. The line of effort number three is now prioritizing the sense of need because, really, traditional AI and autonomy have a lot of overlap, probably about – and just making up a number. Don’t quote me. But about 80 percent of the capabilities required for one are in another.
Mr. Allen: Right. Think of a Tesla autonomous car. What makes them that hard? AI is most of the story.
Capt. Lugo: Correct. Right. So they all need data labeling. They all need a model repository and control systems. They all need – both of them need containerization efforts, instrumentation efforts, all of this.
The differences between one and the other is the autonomy line of effort needs modeling and simulation, needs other – there’s other synthetic areas that are required in the – in that line of effort. So that – those capabilities have now been prioritized from our roadmap so that we can support –
Mr. Allen: So you’re developing these modeling and simulation capabilities, or planning to.
Capt. Lugo: I won’t say developing. We are making them available.
Mr. Allen: You’re making available.
Capt. Lugo: Yes. Thank you.
Mr. Allen: This is probably coming from industry, right? Yeah.
Capt. Lugo: (Laughs.) Yes. That is a good way of putting it, right.
So but the other piece – and you alluded to it, so all of this is connected, right, the way we think about these things. The other piece is traditional ways of thinking of autonomy vehicles, again, has been stovepiped, right? You buy a bottle of water but you want to put autonomy on it, right? It’s not how does that bottle of water fit in the autonomy world.
Those are two different ways of thinking about it. So the program offices have been, again, very stovepiped in the way they think of autonomy. As with AI/ML in general we are looking at how can we leverage the similarities of autonomy across weapon systems and more specifically the data.
So if I’m training – if I got data for an aircraft, A, the Navy aircraft will probably benefit from the same data set and vice versa.
Mr. Allen: They might use similar sensors. They might use similar engines. Who knows? Yeah.
Capt. Lugo: A lot more similarity than not, right? And even with terrain vehicles or even surface vehicles can also provide data for other vehicles. So that’s one piece, right? That’s the sensor data and making that data available for all the developers to utilize that.
So you see how the – the theme is converging to the same story here between what we’re talking about. So her point about how we’re supporting Replicator, just to close the loop on that, we are from the perspective of we are enabling autonomy, specifically perception autonomy, and that is – I got to be very specific about that because there’s two pieces of – there’s multiple pieces to autonomy.
Perception autonomy is the closest to taking a sensor and using AI to determine what that sensor saw or interpreted or inferenced, right?
There’s another piece of autonomy which is C2 autonomy, command and control of a particular vehicle. That is still left at the program offices to develop. So that is not what we’re enabling at this time. At this time, what we’re focusing on is on the sensor autonomy piece or the perception of autonomy.
Mr. Allen: But that’s a problem that so many program offices are going to run into. If you can make their life easier –
Capt. Lugo: Absolutely, which is why we’re trying to prompt it, right. A lot of excitement around that technology and, obviously, military personnel were also very excited about it, right?
So as time progressed – and I’m doing a little time line here – from November to about the summer of ’23 – beginning of the summer of ’23 – we started realizing that – we as in DOD started realizing, hey, we need to come up with an understanding of what this technology is in the sense of how can we apply it, should we apply it, and what are the guardrails around it, what are the risks, mitigations, and then also if we’re going to apply it and we decided we are should we do this in what kind of fashion with all the boring terminology. How do we acquire it, what is the acquisition, what’s the sustainment path, all that kind of stuff.
 So all of those are questions that needed to be answered. So a good way of doing that is establishing a task force to address that. Even better was the way Secretary Hicks did it which was, I’m giving you a timeline, 18 months. That’s it. You got to answer all these in 18 months. Otherwise, we’re going to get into rabbit holes and start studying this problem forever.
So in August of ’22 was the actual charter signature of the task force.
Mr. Allen: August of ’22?
Capt. Lugo: No, ’23. I’m sorry.
Mr. Allen: ’23. There we go.
Capt. Lugo: August of ’23. My apologies.
Mr. Allen: Like, did you have an advance notice of ChatGPT, you know? (Laughs.)
Capt. Lugo: No. I did have – I did have two months to set up phase zero of the task force.
Mr. Allen: Ok.
Capt. Lugo: They had a warn order. But the establishment was on August of ’23.
So what have we done, then? We have – again, I like the three line of effort approach, right? So we established who’s who, what are our deliverables, and we also established three lines of effort within the task force. Those are learn, accelerate, guide. Not that GIDE, G-U-I-D-E.
So those three lines of effort are, obviously, ongoing because they’re line of efforts but learn was the one focus in the beginning. The learn line of effort was about collecting use cases from everyone, everything from E-3s submitted use cases to strategic command submitted use cases.
We’ve got now close to 230 use cases – official use cases collected and what we’ve – what we did we categorized those use cases into what capabilities are people really looking for. Yeah.
Mr. Allen: And this is taking the form of, like, a data call to the rest of the Department of Defense asking them, you know, hey, this is generative AI – what could you envision in your mission set using it for? Is that right?
Capt. Lugo: Yeah. Yeah. Correct. We have a portal and people enter those use cases in and then – and that is ongoing. We keep going. And, again, like you said, not just LLMs, which is what people were focusing on in the beginning, which is also why it’s Task Force Lima because when we started we were looking at it mostly from LLM. As we progressed from phase zero to actual charter signature we changed it to generative AI but we didn’t change the name so we kept it as Lima.
However, with that said the generative AI cases are, I would say, that are not LLM, the other modalities, are starting to come in now. There mostly is LLM type – yes.
Mr. Allen: Most of the focus remains on LLMs, yeah.
Capt. Lugo: Correct. Now, we’ve got – so that’s line of everyone so we learned that. But at the same time – and this is what is exciting about this – what we were also learning was what are the actual capabilities out there from industry, and it’s funny because you said do you have any notice about generative AI because I said 2022.
This is the first time that I can confidently say that we are a week to two weeks only behind from what’s actually in the technology space out there and it is because our industry is so forthcoming to us as to, hey, this is what’s coming. This is what we’re doing. What do you guys think, you know.
Not that we’re shaping but they do come in with a way of expressing, hey, is there a use – it’s more of the is there a use case that you could use this in, right, because they know we’re collecting those.
Mr. Allen: So, you know, November 2022 ChatGPT came as a surprise.
Capt. Lugo: Yeah.
Mr. Allen: The first problem that you’ve solved is the DOD is no longer likely to be surprised, right?
Capt. Lugo: Correct.
Mr. Allen: You’ve got the right lines of communication with the right organizations. Yeah.
Capt. Lugo: Absolutely, yes. So we got industry. You know, obviously, academia is also part of this, the FFRDCs. So that’s line of effort number one. Line of effort number two, which is the accelerate line – I’ll tell you in a second here.
Let me just finish with line of effort number three, which is the guideline. That’s the one where we’re going to be writing frameworks, everything from mitigations and risk assessments to, you know, the cybersecurity stuff, the security classification guide, recommendations how to do those.
But we took a line of effort number three item within 30 days of establishment, which was called the interim guidance, to the department. So the interim guidance to the department was like, hey, this is out there – what do we do, right? What are my left and right limits of the tool?
That guidance focused on two main aspects. One of them is all current policies and regulations out there apply.
Mr. Allen: Right.
Capt. Lugo: So just because this is a new tech doesn’t mean that you get to not do what you used to do before, right?
Mr. Allen: And just thinking about what some of those policies might be, right, accessing cloud-based services from the DOD network is not necessarily allowed just because your browser can navigate to that page, right?
Capt. Lugo: Correct. Correct. Exactly. Similar to the internet, right? So it’s all, you know, data that you should not be putting in these models, right? Information –
Mr. Allen: Right. Don’t take your CUI data, copy paste it in the –
Capt. Lugo: Absolutely correct. Yes.
Mr. Allen: – ChatGPT and ask it to do your homework for you.
Capt. Lugo: So that was number one, right. The other piece is a human is always accountable. So don’t point to Google or to open AI and say, well, they wrote it. No, that’s not what happened. You are the author. You are still accountable for any information, any reports, anything that comes out of it and, more importantly, if you’re a commander you’re making decisions based on this. You’re going to be accountable based on that.
So what that did was it opened the aperture to yes, go ahead, experiment and try this. But it still made it query it, be skeptical about it, always have a human in the loop, you know. So that gave us some time to come up with even more focused type guidance, which is that’s what line of effort number three is going to be at the end of the 18 months.
Quickly to line of effort number two, that’s the accelerate line of effort. That one is about building sandboxes, partnering with exercise groups like GIDE and ensuring that we actually now provide more of these capabilities via whatever mechanism whether it’s a license, whether it’s a GOTZ (ph), whether it’s a – you know, a(n) integrated tool into a particular workflow – any of the methods in order to accelerate those use cases that all they need is a little bit more of a push, whether it was they didn’t have the resources together or they didn’t have access to the tools, but all in one of our cages so that we can go ahead and contain those use cases.
So it’s a lot of data experimentation, but in a – with a purpose – experimentation with a purpose, right, which is we are not just doing this as a research project; we’re doing it because we want to accelerate a workflow that is asked by a particular use case.
Finally, what we’ll also do in a combination of line of effort one and two what it does is also – I know that we collected these use cases, which are limited to the imagination and knowledge of the people that submitted the use cases, but there are also some potentials here that may have not been explored, what you all think, and we’ll probably publish that to the force.
So that’s a summary of where we are. I don’t know if you have any particular questions.
Mr. Allen: Well, I’d like to actually turn to you, Colonel Strohmeyer, because you said in the GIDE series you’ve already now got warfighting communities using LLMs in this sort of side-by-side competition.
So you already talked about what the – you know, what that was like. I’m curious, what are the results? You know, how helpful was it to actually use an LLM in this test you ran?
Col. Strohmeyer: Yeah. Yeah. Great question, Greg.
So what we’ve – we found is that for certain use cases that it’s proving to have a lot of value. So it’s not, you know, this panacea but it’s also not this Pandora’s box of evil that we – it’s somewhere in between, right?
And so use cases such as content retrieval when we are – especially when we’re dealing with open source information it’s providing very, very valuable because when it comes to OSINT or open source information there’s just, I mean, terabytes of data that you could be gathering from and it’s too much for a human to make sense of all those things, especially when you’re combining different types of open source information and bringing them together. It just requires a lot of humans to make any sense of it.
But when you take that same information and you give it a very tailored specific prompt about, you know, look for new changes in the road network in this area that may not have been identified previously it can identify that really well and it can also do it in a way that exposes the sources to humans so that they can check and see.
So we’ve seen a lot of very positive responses with that, that it’s that content retrieval but content retrieval in the context of identifying new changes and new patterns. That’s the – it’s one thing to gather content. It’s another thing to then give contextual changes to that content that is really valuable to humans.
So we’re seeing that across many of our workflows that we have inside GIDE, that there’s a lot of promise there. Also, initial content creation. Not the final answer but, like, initial content creation. For those of us that have lived and worked in combatant commands in the past you know that a day-to-day mission that you have – even not just day-to-day but even crisis or conflict is the rapid creation of information for a commander to be able to distill about what’s going on in this area and to be able to give it to them that takes hundreds and hundreds of hours of combatant commands.
And so one of the ways that we’ve seen promise is taking that day-to-day mission that’s required to get that information up there and using things like generative AI to get initial hack at, you know, what’s going on, what’s the information, doing it in a way that we can see what sources were pulled on to be able to generate that information and then have the human kind of curate it and edit it after that. That’s another use case that we’re seeing a lot of promise in.
Mr. Allen: That’s great. And what actually goes into making this available to an operational community?
I think most folks who are watching online have probably played around with ChatGPT. But ChatGPT is, you know, made available in a web cloud interface. That’s not necessarily going to be available to a warfighter if there are degraded communications or, alternatively, it might not just be approved because of cybersecurity guidelines or anything else.
So when you’re using a large language model in the GIDE series what actually goes into making that available to the warfighters? Are you using, you know, a custom system that is being ported onto DOD networks? Are you just allowing them to access ChatGPT? How is this happening?
Col. Strohmeyer: Yeah. No. So we’re being very measured about it. We’re taking our cues from Task Force Lima and the guidance that’s been sent – that interim guidance that X talked about before. But so, one, we are using some things that exist at what we would call impact level four so, essentially, unclassified things.
Mr. Allen: This is the – yeah, the data security – (inaudible) – yeah.
Col. Strohmeyer: Exactly. So we’re making sure that we’re being smart about it because anytime we use one of these things if you use it in certain ways it could be repopulating data back out into kind of the internet.
And so we want to be smart about how we do that so we’re kind of using them in ways, if it’s at the unclassified level, that kind of protects the government’s data and protects our workflows in an appropriate way but still uses all those great things that industry could give us.
But then we’re also using them at the classified way, so up on classified networks that are kind of enclaved off and, importantly, have now access to classified data.
So in a similar way – not the similar tool but in a similar way you would have a ChatGPT that had access to these troves of unclassified data just existing out there commercially now we have in a more protected way access to classified data that can allow the tools to be using those things that are more operationally relevant for our warfighters.
So we’ve been able to give warfighters access to both those and learn as we went.
Capt. Lugo: Yeah. If I could add a little bit.
So the – absolutely. So your point of tools that are persistent, right? Like, for example, some of the common use tools those are not the ones that we’re encouraging right now for utilization, right, for multiple reasons.
Now, with that said, there’s still utility for those, right? There’s a – one of our use cases I keep mentioning a lot is – there’s a sermon writing for chaplains, right. They can go ahead and utilize an open source. No issue.
But the real utility comes into the tools that we can actually isolate into our – so I divide the world into three – the wild, the zoo, and the cages, right? So the wild is what’s outside. The zoo is the building. The DOD is the zoo and then the cages within it, right?
The way that any tool that can actually be containerized and can actually be utilized within either the zoo or a cage those are the ones that we’re contemplating mostly for the use of the warfighters, specifically when you start going to an impact level – higher impact levels, right? There is no way to connect outside.
The only problem with that is that the request is really to get what’s the latest and greatest. The latest and greatest doesn’t perform –
Mr. Allen: Lives in the wild. (Laughs.) Yeah. Yeah.
Capt. Lugo: Lives in the wild. That’s correct. So that’s where we are partnering and putting that as a requirement from our – or more than a requirement, a challenge – a challenge to industry, hey, how can we go ahead, and these tools are in a persistent way in the wild. How can we tame them and put them into the zoo in cages?
So that challenge –
Mr. Allen: Without them getting stale and old quickly, right? Yeah.
Capt. Lugo: Correct. So that’s a challenge that we have put out there and now –
Mr. Allen: Sounds like you’re having conversations with the folks you want to be having conversations with at that point.
Capt. Lugo: Correct. Yeah.
Mr. Allen: Great. So how does – so this capability exists. You know, one, I’m impressed that it’s already working with classified data because we all know the authority to operate process is a formidable opponent in trying to do anything with AI or data in the DOD environment.
But I’m curious. You know, how does this story end in a capability that is sustained and delivered to COCOMs on an ongoing basis? So what has to happen to get from – you’ve run these side-by-side exercises. You have large language model-enabled capabilities that, you know, warfighters love.
Now, how do they get to keep having them after GIDE leaves or when they deploy to, you know, INDOPACOM or wherever?
Col. Strohmeyer: Yes. Great question.
So I’ll just echo what I think the deputy secretary of defense said just a couple weeks ago is that we needed an appropriations bill to be able to do this.
Mr. Allen: That helps.
Col. Strohmeyer: We got that. So that was great.
So now we think in the same way that we had to slow down our efforts because of that we were still – we still delivered them in viable capability, but we did have to slow down considerably. We’re now able to start pushing these things out more to combatant commands in ways that we wanted to.
Mr. Allen: And that’s going to be a CDAO-provisioned capability? Is that the –
Col. Strohmeyer: Much of it will be, but we have a lot of partnerships. So we have partnerships across OSD with other principal staff agencies, with other organizations, with the services. But CDAO does have a unique kind of role and mission in doing that and so we see that as kind of part of that unique role and mission.
Specifically for CJADC2 that is one of our unique roles that we have to be able to give that capability out. So we’re going to be doing that in a way that will look kind of like a program office does, at least in the near term.
But then we also view it this is not – for at least CJADC2 specifically in the AI-enabled capabilities related to that this is not like an end state that we get to where we’re, like, OK, we have achieved CJADC2 – AI-enabled CJADC2.
This is going to be an ongoing iterative effort. It’s going to look like agile software development – that it’s just going to keep developing, keep working side by side with warfighters, but have the programmatic WASTA (ph) behind it that allows us to be able to make it real and make it sustainable at the combatant commands.
But it’s going to look probably different than a normal, you know, hardware program of record will look.
Mr. Allen: That’s great. Anything you would like to add here?
Capt. Lugo: I mean, the challenges are there but also I think there’s a lot of great momentum to solving those. So yes, there are policy challenges. Yes, there are data sharing challenges, especially when you start getting into higher classifications, right?
Mr. Allen: Yeah. But I wanted to ask specifically about, you know, how this becomes a sustained capability. Is that something that should – like, should every program of record be buying a large language model? Should the CDAO be providing that, essentially some other model that I’m not thinking of here?
Capt. Lugo: Right. So that’s – so –
Mr. Allen: This is not yet decided?
Capt. Lugo: – the cheap answer for me to give you is wait until we’re done and then we’ll give you the answer to that, right.
Mr. Allen: Task Force Lima answer forthcoming. OK.
Capt. Lugo: Right. But the – but in actuality it’s somewhere in the middle, right? You don’t want – it’s cost inefficient and it’s unsustainable to say, OK, everybody has their own large language model.
But also the technology is changing so quick that that is not even – that was thought of less – so six months ago. Six months ago everybody was thinking that way. That’s not the approach that we need anymore on this and we’ve all established that foundational models should be built by the companies that build foundational models right now, which is probably a handful, right? I mean, you can count on each hands, right?
Mr. Allen: Yet, CDAO has folks with, you know, relevant skill sets on staff but they’re not going to compete against an open AI or a Google.
Capt. Lugo: There is no point.
Mr. Allen: Yeah. There is no point.
Capt. Lugo: There is no – and not only are they, like, half a billion dollars to build, you got to refresh these things and there’s a sustainability model just with that, right? Now, with that said, there are ways where you can mitigate a lot of the concerns that are out there about building these things in the wild, right, and then maybe build more purpose-built ones.
There’s also methods, you know, whether it’s fine tuning, whether it’s – or other methods to focus – like Nomad was saying, focus models in your particular area in particular. So we’re looking at orchestrations. We’re looking at – so there’s many, many solutions.
I think at the end of the day we’re going to come up with enterprise like solution sets. But I don’t want to even think of excluding any purpose-built models for whatever reason. So it’ll be probably pretty open. I know that was probably the worst answer I gave you right here on that.
Mr. Allen: No. I think it kind of reflects sort of where you are in the process and the fact that, you know, you are – you have your own opinions but you’re also the person who’s in charge of getting the DOD together to have this conversation. So I respect that.
So that does bring us to time and I want to thank you both so much for coming to CSIS and giving us the sort of first look at the Alpha 1 program, the update on Task Force Lima, and the update on the GIDE series.
This has been absolutely terrific. Thank you very much.
Capt. Lugo: Thank you.
Col. Strohmeyer: Thank you, Greg. Really appreciate it.
Mr. Allen: And for those who are watching there’s going to be a brief minute break where we’re going to come back with Jason Brown who’s the lead for applied intuition defense. So if you’ll just wait a few minutes we’ll be back momentarily.
Thanks very much.
 (Break.)
Mr. Allen: Welcome back to CSIS. Once again, I’m Gregory Allen, the director of the Wadhwani Center for AI and Advanced Technologies here at CSIS. And now we’re joined with Jason Brown, who is the general manager for defense at Applied Intuition, or, more accurately, the general manager of Applied Intuition Defense. And previously was a colonel in the United States Air Force, where he oversaw so many different phases of the DOD’s AI transformation.
Jason Brown, thanks so much for being here.
Jason Brown: Yeah, great to be here. Thank you.
Mr. Allen: So I want to start with you and a little bit about your story. You and I had the opportunity to work together at the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center at DOD. But your AI journey at DOD begins even before that. So help us understand where that story begins.
Mr. Brown: Yeah, sure. So I’d spent 26 years as an intelligence officer. So the further you go along in the intelligence career field, it’s less about analysis and it’s more about getting ones and zeros to the analyst, right? So, you know, over the course of time I got really involved in essentially data management, software development, other things that would enable our mission. And then, you know, from there, I did a lot of work with a lot of emerging tech sort of organizations and accelerators. So DIU and AFWERX. And then, of course, Project Maven. So I was the 480th ISAR wing commander. I was actually a customer of Project Maven.
Jack Shanahan, who was – who was leading Project Maven at the time, he and I were – had gone aways back. He was my boss once upon a time when I was a group commander. And essentially, we were trying to find a way to implement AI, computer vision specifically, for the mission to the 480th ISAR wing, which was, you know, focused heavily on imagery analysis, et cetera. And then –
Mr. Allen: Is it accurate – is it accurate to say you were the first customer for Project Maven? Or one of the first?
Mr. Brown: It was definitely one of the first. You know, there were several different customers, different types of imagery that we were focused on. The one that we were heavily focused on for the 480th was something called Gorgon Stare, right? So Gorgon Stare was a pod that went on an MQ-9 that could actually, you know, orbit an area, look at eight kilometers all at once, in high definition. So I had 10 airmen – because that’s – the limitation was essentially, you know, you could have essentially 10 workstations is tied to that imagery.
But if you can look at it, if this table was Mosul, Iraq, for example, and you can only look through 10 soda straws at various different points, you’re missing a whole bunch of intelligence. And so the main effort for Project Maven in support of the 480th was to figure out how Gorgon – how we could apply computer vision toward Gorgon Stare. That actually led us – interestingly, you know, we – it led us to CVPR, the computer vision pattern recognition, conference. Where Jack Shanahan, Drew Cukor, who was, you know, the executive director for Project Maven, and I pitching Google for this particular product. So Google was the performer on this project. I think many of us know, you know, kind of the way that that played out.
I will say that when my airmen were working with Google on this project, they felt like they were part of the project team. And like – or, the product team, right? So they were heavily engaged, you know, the engineers were, you know, at our site at Beale Air Force base. Our airmen would go to Mountain View, and work through it. And so for me that, you know, kind of helped me understand what right looked like. And then as I went to the Pentagon and I worked in the Strategic Studies Group for the – at the time, for the vice chief of staff of the Air Force, I got heavily involved in standing up the Joint AI Center. I led the humanitarian assistance disaster relief initiative. So very focused, again, on computer vision.
So I had essentially, you know, that job, and then started something called the AI Accelerator at MIT. So the vice chief asked me, you know, hey, how do we make AI real? And I said, well, you know, essentially, the Army is talking to Carnegie Mellon. Let’s go talk to MIT. And that – you know, that organization is still going strong. They’ve been able to, you know, put out several different challenges. Some of that tech is now converting and actually transitioning into actual capability. And so, it’s been an exciting journey, right? Just going from the point of, you know, trying to just get software to work to the point that we’re at today, right? And it’s been, you know, really fascinating to see the evolution.
Mr. Allen: That’s amazing. So, you know, you were originally a customer for AI computer vision capabilities, then you became a part of the program that was developing those capabilities, then you became a part of this MIT initiative that was sort of teaching what you had learned to the broader DOD. A really amazing journey.
Mr. Brown: Yeah.
Mr. Allen: And now you’re at Applied Intuition Defense. And tell us a little bit about Applied Intuition.
Mr. Brown: Absolutely. So Applied Intuition is a company that started – so our cofounders are Qasar Younis and Peter Ludwig. They both came from Google. That’s where they met. But more importantly, they came from Detroit. They’re both – they are – you know, their families are both in the auto industry. They essentially, you know, at Google came up with an amazing idea to produce software for vehicles, started Applied Intuition in 2017. And then over the course of time, Qasar, who’s an immigrant, knew that he wanted to give back to the nation. And he knew – both he and Peter – knew that the tech that Applied was developing for, you know, driver assistance in autonomous vehicles would be very applicable to the defense space.
In particular, there was a lot of opportunity to, you know, develop, you know, autonomy and autonomous capabilities for off road. And this created, you know, an opportunity with both DIU, which we’re working on today for the remote combat vehicle, among others. And so we’ve also noted that, you know, kind of working in the defense space, as you can imagine, there are some really, really hard problems. Hard problems around maneuverability and perception that go beyond what you would normally see in a, you know, autonomous driving situation and in the District here, for example.
And so, these hard problems – you know, that our company is about solving these really difficult problems. And by doing that with, you know, our defense customers, we’re able to both take technology that we’ve developed and apply it, but also be able to evolve our technology in a way that both defense benefits and actually it comes back into the commercial sector. So for example, you know, the off-road technology – off-road autonomy technology that we’re developing is finding its way back into construction and mining, just specifically because we got involved with defense.
Mr. Allen: Oh, no kidding? So let’s stick with Detroit for one moment here, because Applied Intuition is getting pretty well known here in Washington, D.C. and throughout the DOD ecosystem. But, as you said, in Detroit it’s, like, a household name. So what exactly does Applied Intuition do for the commercial automotive industry? What does a – what does a GM or a Ford – what do they come to Applied Intuition looking for?
Mr. Brown: Sure. So as you can imagine, everything is driven by software these days, right? So the automotive industry, the OEMs, have recognized that, you know, their ability to provide capability, right, efficiency within their vehicles, you know, safety for the vehicles, mobility for their vehicles, all comes down to a software problem. And so Applied develops that software in a number of different ways. The tools that are needed to essentially develop autonomous software – so everything from mapping. to perception, to data management, to synthetic data, all the way up to actual – the actual autonomous vehicle platform. So and then something in between.
So every OEM is – and Applied works with 18 out of the top 20 car manufacturers in the world. And so every one of them is in a different place with their software journey. Some of them are, you know, much further along. Some of them need, you know, a piece or a part, whether it’s testing or whether it’s actual, you know, components – software components that they want to put on the vehicle. And so Applied is there offering those capabilities. And then, as you could imagine, you know, that is a market that is only growing, right? And so from a commercial sector standpoint.
As we see, as I mentioned, you know, that technology has very direct applicability not just for, you know, ground vehicles. But autonomy all starts generally with perception. So perception drives the rest of that workflow. You know, the capabilities that we develop around perception, you know, are applicable to maritime, they’re applicable to aviation. And wherever you might need an autonomous system, you know, there’s an opportunity to leverage the technology that we’re building in the commercial space.
Mr. Allen: So your company creates the software that allows a car manufacturer or whomever to develop their own autonomy software that actually goes inside the car. So you make the tools that helps the car maker make an autonomous software stack.
Mr. Brown: That is – that is true. And then, you know, but also going all the way through and developing, you know, much more holistic AV stacks, right? So autonomous vehicle stacks.
Mr. Allen: Also to manage that autonomous system and the fleet of autonomous vehicles that are out there in the – in the wider world.
Mr. Brown: That’s right.
Mr. Allen: So that’s amazing. And you said, 18 out of the top 20 car manufacturers in the world are already using Applied Intuition’s software.
Mr. Brown: That’s right, yeah.
Mr. Allen: That’s great. And so now you’ve already talked a little bit about how that comes into the defense ecosystem, but just sort of connecting it to your own experience from your time working in DOD. How would a DOD customer – and you said you’re already a part of the Army RCV Program, among others – you know, what do they get when they work with an Applied Intuition?
Mr. Brown: Yeah. I mean, they get – you know, beyond the amazing tech that we have, you’ve got a company that is hyper focused on solving these very difficult problems. Essentially, you know, the software that goes into some of the things like RCV, the tools that – you know, that is used to develop it, are not far off from the commercial use cases. We see this more broadly with, you know, a lot of AI and autonomy challenges for the DOD.
I will say that there are use cases – I mentioned – I mentioned the off road, and, you know, to some degree, you know, aviation and maritime – that are going to be somewhat unique for DOD. But the foundational expertise, the foundational technical expertise, the foundational software, all of it starts, you know, on the commercial space that you’re able to evolve and modify, and even create new products. But at the end of the day, you know, having an understanding of how you tackle that problem is, you know, what we’re known for, just being able to tackle these very difficult, challenging, autonomous, you know, system problems.
Mr. Allen: That’s amazing. And the Army RCV is, I believe, a robotic combat vehicle, is that right?
Mr. Brown: Correct, yeah.
Mr. Allen: And so that program is still in the development stage, right?
Mr. Brown: It is in the development stage, absolutely.
Mr. Allen: And so your tools are actually helping them develop the sort of initial autonomous system, in this case. But then conceivably you could stay with them even after they’ve completed development, because, as you said, you have sort of tools that are more on the lifecycle fleet management side as well.
Mr. Brown: Correct. And, you know, so much of this is about sustainment, right? And so software is never done. You know, it is – you have to really treat it like a living organism. When it comes to autonomy in particular, you’ve got, you know, cases that you come across – you know, a system will come across – whether it’s, you know, ambiguous, whether it’s a novel, whether it’s rare – and then being able to have that sort of flywheel of development that is taking those, you know, situations, and then updating the software based on what you’re coming across. So it’s never done. It’s not, you know, you put the – you put the software in, and then you, you know, occasionally do a block upgrade. When it comes to especially military equipment, military capabilities, that sustainment has to be constant.
Mr. Allen: Yeah. And you mentioned software is never done, which, of course, was the title of a very famous defense industry board report, coauthored by our mutual friend Josh Marcuse, who’s now a nonresident here at CSIS. But I think software is never done as true of software. But in the case of artificial intelligence and machine learning, it’s really never done. I mean, literally the operational data that you are gathering just in the courses of using your autonomous system, that is the raw material training data for the next update to the overall system. And in a changing world, if you’re not constantly having data that is changing alongside their operational environment, your capability is probably not going to be that useful.
Mr. Brown: Yeah, exactly. And, you know, it’s a constant – you know, the input-output is so dynamic. You’re having software operate in an open system. You need to have that, you know, consistent feedback loop with that new data. I’ll give you an example of how we do that at Applied. I mentioned perception. So perception – understanding perception and performance of perception is so incredibly important.
Mr. Allen: This is, like, sensor data.
Mr. Brown: Sensor data. So whether it be lidar, radar, optical, for example. Knowing how those models – right? So that’s all tied to a model. The model, you know, is recognizing that environment. And so it’s a scenario. So a scenario being, you know, there’s vehicle dynamics, there’s sensor dynamics, there’s the environment, and the actors within it. So the all of that creates data sets that are part of a scenario. And so understanding how perception is performing, how the models are performing in those scenarios, is incredibly important. And being able to monitor that.
So, for example, I’ll use an aerial example. So if you have, you know, a drone that is, you know, not acknowledging, or not recognizing, not detecting certain objects in an environment, and then you can – you can see where that perception – you know, we have tools that can actually see where that performance degrades. And then you can immediately say, OK, well here’s a scenario: The environment, the vehicle dynamic, the sensor dynamic. Where have we seen this scenario before? And then literally going through a library of data and calling up those scenarios, and then creating synthetic, you know, versions of that scenario. And then rapidly retraining the capability to improve your perception very, very quickly.
That is exactly what I mean about, you know, when we – when we talk about how do you sustain software in the field, especially with AI software? You have to be monitoring performance continuously, rapidly retraining, and have all the tools to do the data management, and then the rapid retraining to be able to do that.
Mr. Allen: And that synthetic data, which, you know, that’s a term that a lot of people use in a lot of different ways. But specifically on autonomy, I think what you’re referring to is the ability of, you know, modeling and simulation environments to actually sort of create circumstances that perhaps you – perhaps you only observe them one time in real world conditions, but then you recognize that this is an important scenario that you need to be able to adjust for. So you create 10,000 synthetic versions of that same scenario. And now it’s a part of your training data set. Is that – is that sort of what you had in mind?
Mr. Brown: That’s exactly right, yeah. And, you know, there’s been – there’s been a lot of folks who had been very skeptical about synthetic data. I think, you know, we’ve even heard – you know, senior leaders within the Department of Defense had been skeptical, which is totally understandable. I will say, from my company’s perspective, the automotive industry has to – has to use synthetic data to train, because live testing is super expensive, time consuming, and you just don’t have the iterations of training to be able to do that in a live environment.
So anyone doing anything autonomy with regard to training is using synthetic environment. Not 100 percent, but a large percentage of their training and their modeling is done in that synthetic environment. And so your ability to create those environments, to create those scenarios I described before, is really, really key. And then so you never do 100 percent synthetic. You use synthetic to augment your live training. And then you validate, of course, in a live environment. But it’s critical to be able to do that. because you’re literally iterating, thousands and thousands of times to be able to ensure that that model is leading to a very reliable autonomous system.
Mr. Allen: And I sympathize with Department of Defense officials who might be a little bit skeptical when they hear something about synthetic data, because, frankly, there are companies out there who are making promises they can’t deliver when it comes to synthetic data. But as you’ve articulated it, right, synthetic data is not a substitute for real-world data. It’s not an excuse to not go get real-world data. But it is an opportunity to get vastly more miles per gallon out of your real-world data by extending that dataset, by supplementing it with synthetic.
Because for these incredibly rare scenarios that you’re only going to see a handful of time in real world, well, one data set – you know, one data example is not enough for your AI system, your machine learning system to train on that. It needs 50,000 examples. But if you have the one, you can use synthetic data to create the other 49,000. And thus, this can now be a part of your autonomous system’s capabilities.
Mr. Brown: That’s well said. That’s exactly what we do. And we have to do that for a number of different reasons. But, yeah, that’s exactly what we do. And it’s – so, you know –
Mr. Allen: We actually – I actually recall, you know, a senior executive at a commercial autonomous driving company. They actually said – I think this was in 2017. They said, in terms of delivering performance improvements to the system, they’ve already crossed the threshold where the modeling and simulation-based synthetic data is delivering more performance improvement per month than the real-world data, which they’re spending a lot of money to get that real-world data.
Mr. Brown: Yeah. A lot of money, a lot of time. But at the end of the day, you know, you to your point, you have a lot of rare scenarios, ambiguous scenarios, right? And so you can imagine in the military context with the dynamic, you know, operating environment that warfighters are in, day in and day out, you’ve got to be able to – you know, if you if we’re going to trust these systems, autonomous systems, if we’re going to – you know, if they’re going to be reliable and be used in a way that we can – you know, that can deliver competitive advantage, you need to be able to – you know, they need to be able to constantly evolve and adapt through software sustainment.
Mr. Allen: That’s great. So we’ve been talking about your background. We’ve been talking about Applied Intuition. I want to get a bit of your sense about the DOD’s broader needs when it comes to the types of capabilities that you’re describing. We were just speaking with Captain Lugo and Colonel Strohmeyer of the CDAO. And they talked about modeling and simulation, and capabilities that they want to provide to sort of make life easier for the programs and people across the Department of Defense who are looking to accelerate AI and autonomy. What’s your reaction to sort of that that vision? And how does Applied Intuition fit into the broader picture of, you know, making autonomy development easier in the DOD?
Mr. Brown: So, again, if autonomy is going to be a competitive advantage, the development is the key piece, right? So being able to have a framework. So, scaffolding. We use that term a lot – or, the DOD certainly uses that term a lot. That is that is, I think, a very appropriate term to use. Being able to develop the environment that rapidly, you know, enables exactly the scenarios that I described, sustainment of software in dynamic open environments, that’s exactly what we have to do. And Applied has amazing tools and capabilities along those lines that we, again, developed in the commercial sector and are applying to the defense sector.
There will be some challenges, no doubt, with regard to how you do that. I know there’s a lot of different, you know, either venues or activities within the – within the DOD. The GIDE experiments for example and some others, where they’re trying to really understand, OK, what policies do we change? What capabilities do we develop? What is what is pointing – you know, pointing us in the right way? At the end of the day, I think you have to have a common set of services, and infrastructure, and capability that others can develop on top of.
The challenge, of course, is if you make that overly complex, if you turn it into what I’d like to call a Franken-stack, right? In other words, you have, like, different pieces and parts that you kind of kludge together and you’re constantly replacing those, there’s some disadvantages to that. You’re going to have some inefficiencies. You’re going to have some complexity that’s going to be really difficult to overcome. So the question, you know, that I’m confident, you know, the DOD is constantly asking, is what is the right level of, you know, commonality with regard to capability in sensors and companies? And, you know, and what is the right level of modularity, where we can plug and play and we de-risk certain, you know, scenarios, you know, downstream?
So this is – this is a tough problem. I mean, they’ve got a big job. And, you know, we are definitely there trying to help them through that, especially around – you know, with what CDAO has called the Autonomy Enterprise Platform, which is going to be really fascinating to kind of watch that development of the actual platform that is enabling the rest of the department, bringing autonomous capabilities to bear.
Mr. Allen: Great. And Applied Intuition is exactly the sort of company that DOD leaders have been saying they want to do more work with, right? Folks who have commercial experience in relevant technology domains that are relevant to defense applications. And I want to ask, because you have – through Applied Intuition – this contract that you said DIU was involved with, which is one of those initiatives to try and make it easier for commercially focused businesses to actually start helping the Department of Defense in technology domains. So what has your – what has been Applied Intuition’s experience? What’s been your own professional experience in in these types of initiatives? Are they helping? Is there more that needs to be done in order to bring in more commercial technology?
Mr. Brown: For sure, for sure. I will say, though, that the department has done an amazing job in just – I don’t think there’s any question now that the DOD wants a DIU, with that organization reporting directly to the secretary. That is a strong and bold statement. I don’t think there’s any question, for example, the Air Force wants an AFWERX. They want these technology accelerators because they recognize what – and this is, by the way, you know, not uncommon in the commercial sector, especially large enterprise companies.
What we’ve kind of seen over the course of, certainly, like, the last 20 years, is there tends to be two acquisition pathways for companies that are – that are, you know, really understanding that software is going to be critical to their competitive advantage, to their survivability, et cetera. Software and other types of emerging technology that, you know, tend to follow a different acquisition path than maybe, you know, the hardware and the other components that actually make up an enterprise, you know, capability.
So traditional acquisition pathways are still needed. They’re especially needed to scale capability and integrate a lot of other aspects – doctrine, personnel, training, et cetera. But you’ve got to move fast on the emerging tech side. You’ve got to move fast on the software, you know, development side. That is where this kind of alternate pathway and these organizations, like DIU and AFWERX, for example, have proven so critical. That, you know, for my company in particular, has been absolutely, you know, critical for us to actually – just be able to get connected with the warfighter, be able to provide this amazing technology that we’ve developed for the commercial space, and bring it very quickly.
I can’t imagine that following the same pathway through a traditional – you know, I think we’d get there eventually with, you know, a program of record and some other things. But this kind of first entry with DIU, through other transactional authorities and other contracting methods that are that are nontraditional, is critical.
Mr. Allen: And so it sounds like that’s your goal, right? DIU is the front door, almost, for the Department of Defense. But for this to be a story that ends in real sustainment operations at scale, it has to be the front door to programs of record, right? Which really have the budget, have the sustainment, and have the man, train, and equip, you know, mandate.
Mr. Brown: Yeah, that’s right. I mean, you know, that is fundamentally how the department is designed. That corporate process is critical to be able to scale those capabilities and ensure those capabilities are enduring. But they don’t lend themselves initially to really bring in that emerging tech. So once the emerging tech gets into that space through this alternate pathway I described and that the department has developed, that’s exactly right. It can scale and benefit the warfighter, you know, in a much bigger sense.
Mr. Allen: And then that – we were just talking about organizations like DIU and programs of record. The sort of other side of the equation is what Colonel Strohmeyer was just talking about previously, which is GIDE, which does not refer to itself as “exercises.” They’re an experiment series. But there’s things like GIDE which are bringing in the combatant commands actually giving warfighters an opportunity to try out these new types of technologies. Other examples would be Task Force 59, which has been part of CENTCOM and the Navy’s work in this similar area. So I’m curious, you know, how does the combatant command outreach initiatives and the commercial technology adoption efforts at combatant commands – how does that affect somebody like an Applied Intuition? Is that sort of thing useful to you? Is it attractive to you, as a commercial company?
Mr. Brown: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, these are lighthouse, you know, sort of initiatives that enable the department to kind of ask smarter questions, be able to really start to explore where the – where the technical and policy debt exists that prevent them from actually developing and moving out on capability. But, you know, the challenge, of course, is you have to be very careful with any – you know, and I haven’t participated yet in GIDE. I’ve been watching it from the sidelines. I think it’s fantastic that the department is moving out on these experiments.
You always have to be careful, though, that you aren’t biased toward one capability or one technology or, you know, another. That you’re actually, you know, focused on exposing the problems and exposing the issues that you’re trying to tackle. And, you know, at the end of the day, you’re making policy and investment decisions. And then you also have the big and key questions like, you know, does it work? Does it work better than what we had before? Are the users, are the warfighters, benefiting from it? And, for all of the above, how do we know, right? And so I think these sorts of efforts and exposure to COCOMs and others who have a very, you know, on the ground, you know, warfighter sense, is really key for a company like ours to be able to, you know, connect and understand what problems we should be solving.
Mr. Allen: That’s terrific. And you mentioned the tech and policy debt. And technical debt is a term of art that everybody in Silicon Valley knows about. Policy debt is not something I hear too often in Washington, but I already love this term. So can you talk a little bit about, you know, what are the technical blockers, what are the policy blockers that make it difficult for the DOD to sort of accelerate its adoption of AI and autonomy the way it wants to?
Mr. Brown: Yeah. On the technical debt side, I mean, it’s well known, I think, at this point. It wasn’t necessarily well known, you know, maybe a few years ago. It comes down to, you know, the first issue is data management. How do you get the data that you need? And how do you – and so that also points to an infrastructure challenge which, again, technical debt. You know, when the – when the pandemic was kicking off, the vice chief asked me – he said, how is this going to affect our readiness? And I looked under – you know, under the hood, if you will, of various different – so I looked at readiness for the United States Air Force, kind of it was – OK, it was a – for a pandemic – was a personnel problem, was a medical problem, was an operational problem, was a logistics problem.
And as I looked under each one of those – you know, or opened each one of those doors, if you will, around the whole data management piece, it was not pretty, right? It was loaded with technical debt, at the time. And they have made a lot of progress since then. And this is just 2020. At the time, it was literally 359 separate systems and databases in Air Force logistics and maintenance, half of which were written in COBOL. I mean, you cannot get to AI if you have this type of situation. So there’s a lot of that – a lot of that that has been, since then, recognized and overcome, and a lot of positive momentum on there.
On the policy debt, boy, there’s all kinds of, you know, challenges. I think one of the –probably one of the biggest is authority to operate and the ability to actually get accredited –software accredited and technology accredited to use.
Mr. Allen: Yeah. And the ATO process – this is the mechanism by which software gets permission to touch DOD networks. It’s principally a cybersecurity-driven process, and a review of that. But as an empirical outcome, you know, we’ve heard folks, including folks from the CDAO, to say that the ATO process is among the biggest blockers in accelerating DOD AI adoption. Just talk a little bit about your experience with this.
Mr. Brown: Yeah. I mean, well, that experience goes all the way back, you know, when I was actual, you know, in uniform, you know, in my wing. Wanted to get capability to my airmen. Again, back to the – getting ones and zeros to the analysts, right? I knew that there was software capability that I wanted them to have. I knew that there was development environments that I wanted them to have. It was remarkable for me to watch just so many airmen actually developing code, right, who are not, you know, by any stretch of the means, trained software developers. But they figured it out. They were trying to overcome a pain point that was, you know, critical to them providing analysis. But the ATO, the – you know, the – essentially, the accreditation process to get them those tools and capabilities was just so long and cumbersome.
I will tell you this, if we want to use LLMs in a really effective way, like, use them to actually write a system security package for an ATO –
Mr. Allen: (Laughs.) And this is like a phonebook-thick, you know, document that you have to fill out basically in paper saying: Please let my system touch the –
Mr. Brown: It’s a paper – it’s a – exactly. So but imagine that just for a second, like, that, you know, you have – you have all of the guiding, you know, regulations, right? You know, think it’s NIST 800-53, and I might have messed that up, but a bunch of these things. You have a bunch of system security packages that have been approved and accredited that can be loaded as your – you know, as you’re fine tuning an LLM. And imagine, you know, you engage that LLM with this new situation. And then you can actually get, you know, an LLM to build that SSP out for you. Walk it through. And you reduce the pain points on the authorizing official, the accreditation authorities. On the person who has to actually develop thing. You also, as kind of a byproduct, actually, like, standardized these things.
But anyway, but the policy – the policy, debt around that particular issue, I think, is one of the biggest blockers. And work – the department has to figure out how to adjust that policy to, obviously, you have to have secure systems. And, you know, interesting, we’re not talking enough about AI security. It’s something we talk a lot about in my company, and in my last company, you know, for that matter. And so –
Mr. Allen: Yeah, because there’s Chinese cybersecurity firms that are bragging about their ability to hack autonomous cars. Presumably, they’re thinking the same thing about military autonomous systems.
Mr. Brown: Yeah. Now, we, obviously – you know, that – security is life or death for a company like ours, and every other software company out there. You know, when I was at Google, we were – we were talking heavily about, you know, AI security and figuring out what is different from AI security compared to normal software security. So that is all needed to be accounted for. However, we’ve got to figure out a way to streamline this process. You know, otherwise it continues to be a barrier not just for companies who are trying to do business and get their capability to the DOD, but, you know, for the – for the warfighter themselves.
Mr. Allen: Mmm hmm. So one of the more exciting initiatives that’s come out of DOD in the past year or so is what Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks announced, which is the Replicator Initiative. Which, you know, in her words, aims to field thousands of low-cost, attritable autonomous systems by August 2025. So in the not-too-distant future. And I’m interested here, because this is one of the most high-level DOD officials to very publicly endorse autonomy and autonomous capabilities as foundational to the future of military power and warfighting. And when you see that initiative, you know, what’s your view of the Replicator Initiative, and its implementation so far?
Mr. Brown: That’s a great question. First of all, I’m glad it’s a thing, right? I’m glad. I’m glad there’s, you know, a very clear impetus on developing autonomous capabilities and a recognition, especially, you know, as we as we look at Ukraine and we’re starting to infer some lessons from that conflict. You know, Replicator, from what I know, to your point, it is about attritable autonomous systems. It’s also about an acquisition accelerator, from what I’ve heard the deputy secretary say. And I think it’s also very much evolving. So I think the – you know, it’s really important, I think, for the department to continue to, you know, refine and communicate, you know, its perspective on Replicator and what does that mean.
Is that a pathway? Is there something we should be doing in industry that is very focused around solving a very specific problem? Because we’re ready to do that. We just want to know, you know, with as much clarity as the department can provide what those problems might be. To be fair, that’s going to evolve. The department’s going to have new considerations. There’s going to be some things that come out. And that’s totally fine. As long as that communication keeps going.
The other thing is funding. You know, originally Replicator was not funded – or, not asked for funding for FY ’24. The latest appropriation, I think it’s 200 million (dollars) is going to the Replicator program. I imagine there’s going to be a lot more coming in FY ’25. It’s great. But as we could imagine, you know, with an appropriation for Replicator, what is – what problems is that, you know, appropriation intended to solve? And then that will help us, you know, in industry really focused our development.
Mr. Allen: I think the other encouraging thing that Deputy Secretary Hicks said recently – and she’s actually echoing words that I said at the last Nexus Summit – which is, you know, if we want more autonomous systems we can think about increasing the water pressure – which is, you know, adding more funding – or we can think about unkinking the hose. And, you know, the kinks in the hose – so there’s technical debt, there’s policy debt – that makes it so difficult for the folks in DOD who want to buy, or build, or whatever AI to actually do so.
And I think the fact that she’s talking about these kinks in the hose, she’s talking about working through this policy debt, I think, hopefully shows that not only is there this $200 million for Replicator coming, or these other programs of record that have announced goals of implementing autonomy, but there’s also an effort to get after ATOs and these other policy and process blockers that make it so difficult to use the money that you do have, when you’re fortunate enough to have it in the DOD.
Mr. Brown: Yeah. You know, the kinks in the hose, I think, is a fantastic analogy. You know, and I think, you know, simultaneously you want capability, so – I believe it – I believe you also said, you know, your options are, you know, undo the kink in the hose or just really turn on the water pressure and just try to – just try to crank through, you know, the kink itself. You have to do both, right? You’ve got to figure out a way to –
Mr. Allen: Especially on the timelines we’re trying to operate on.
Mr. Brown: A hundred percent, yeah. A hundred percent. So, you’ve got to be able to move fast, start acquiring. You know, there’s something to be said about – you know, going back to Replicator – let’s do this thing. Let’s move fast, and then expose the kinks, shine a light on the challenges. And then that gets us very focused on where do we – where do we address it? Going back to my readiness example, right? I want to – I want to be able to know, from – you know, going back in time, this problem that we were trying to solve with the pandemic. You know, how does it affect our readiness?
The question is, what – you know, ultimately, we should know what activities we want to start, what we want to stop, with the aircraft availability will be, et cetera, et cetera. These are the real questions that we’re trying to get after to go after readiness. You know, and then, fundamentally, you know, you start down this path, you expose new problems, like 359 separate systems and databases. But when you move out, you know, which Replicator is an example of, right, you’re going to have that opportunity. Learn new things about where those kinks are, and then how do you fundamentally address them.
Mr. Allen: And for somebody like Applied Intuition, whose, you know, bread and butter is the automotive industry, when she talks about low cost, attritable systems, is the tooling and the development, you know, tools that somebody like an Applied Intuition would provide, or the fleet management, lifecycle management tools that somebody like an Applied Intuition would provide – how are they different from something that’s like the Robotic Combat Vehicle, which is meant to be an enduring, pretty expensive platform, versus something that’s, like, low cost and attritable, like the quadcopters we see in Ukraine, which, I think, has been a part of what Deputy Secretary Hicks is talking about for Replicator. What’s the difference?
Mr. Brown: Yeah. Well, let me talk about what’s the same first. You know, this belief, I think, that, OK, I’ve got a low-cost attritable system, and I can it, you know, autonomous, and you know, it’s going to go out there, and it’s going to find a target, and it’s, you know, going to accomplish its mission. It still has, you still have reliability, you know, challenge, right? How do you know, this is going to act in the way that you want it to, if it’s going to be reliable?
Mr. Allen: Because, you know, a $1,000 quadcopter crashing might be cheap. But a $1,000 quadcopter crashing into your $30 million helicopter is not cheap, right? You know, these things need to be reliable.
Mr. Brown: A hundred percent. And, you know, it needs to be able to do its mission. It needs to be, you know, interoperable. You know, it needs to be, you know, something that you are constantly testing and validating. It’s not like you show up at a battlefield with a bunch of things that you just developed and then, you know, employ them. There’s still very much a test and validation process that has to go into that. And it also needs to be continuous.
There’s going to be – you know, we’ve seen, for example, the Russians, you know, doing various different things to try to, you know, address, you know, various different algorithms, computer vision challenges. I mean, you know, put tires – I think they were putting tires on their bombers, or something – something akin to that, right? They were – they were – you know, they were finding a way to build a better mouse, you know, to defeat the mousetrap.
And if you’re not, you know, constantly updating and sustaining, you know, per our earlier discussion, even if it’s low cost and attritable, they still need to be reliable. That’s still very much, you know, a test and evaluation. That’s still building tools and a workflow that is constantly updating that software that is embedded in those systems. For sure, though, you know, there’s a lot of things like, you know, a Remote Combat Vehicle. One of the things, you know, of course, you still have a human who is – who is connected to that Remote Combat Vehicle.
And then so there is going to be some level of human interaction and human in the loop, and/or how users are actually engaging with this system. And understanding that dynamic as well, right? What is – what is the data that we can, you know, pull from that interaction between the human and the autonomous system that we can understand how humans are interacting with the system? Where does this system provide value? Which scenarios is it really useful for? What scenarios does it need more updating and more development?
Mr. Allen: And you mentioned test and evaluation, which is one of the most important, you know, parts of the autonomy lifecycle, and also one of the ones that Applied Intuition and really specializes in. So can you talk about a little bit – and you’ve already touched on this – but just a bit more on sort of what are the unique features of the test and evaluation challenge in the autonomy context? And then also, like, what Applied Intuition specifically does to address those types of challenges?
Mr. Brown: Sure, absolutely. So I go back to that example, with being able to rapidly collect the data from the scenarios that you’re – that you’re, you know, engaging in and that you’re coming across with regard to – in the case of automotive, it’s, you know, the scenario of, you know, driving down the street. You know, you’ve got potentially a bunch of folks crossing the street on their bikes. And, you know, that scenario needs to be replicated. And then, you know, it needs to be very rapidly brought up. And that whole performance of that entire stack needs – in those scenarios – needs to be evaluated and adjusted based on how it’s currently performing.
You could imagine, though, the cases of mobility for – whether it be aerial, maritime, ground based autonomous systems for the DOD. There’s a lot more engagement with a lot of different actors and environments and scenarios that are very complex. So the toolset that we’ve developed originally for those automotive scenarios really comes down to understanding that performance of the entire stack, understanding how we recreate those scenarios or pull those scenarios from data that we’ve collected. And then, again, really training against them to be able to ensure that there’s this constant sustainment and feedback loop going into the software.
Mr. Allen: That’s great. So we’re coming up on time here. And I want to get your sense of what the future holds for Applied Intuition and for, you know, the DOD AI and autonomy transformation. So you’re a relatively recent addition. This is your first year running the Applied Intuition Defense team. And what are you excited about over the next 12 months for Applied Intuition?
Mr. Brown: Oh, I mean, that’s – where do I begin? So the amazing – so, we’re kind of in this – what I compare airpower was in the 1930s, right? So there was some great demonstration of capability. And the operational concepts of airpower, you know, were being developed in that time. And then it was put to – you know, it was scaled in the 1940s. And then, you know, I think that’s where we’re at with autonomy today. Both the technology is really maturing incredibly quickly, how we actually, you know, interact with it, how we develop it, the operational concepts that we’re, you know, beginning to develop to be able to scale that capability.
Applied Intuition is right in the middle of all of that, right? To be able to, you know, both take the technology and the operating concepts to figure out how we do this at scale. One of the other things is, how do we do this not just at scale for a very particular capability, but how do we do this at scale for all autonomous capabilities? And so I mentioned Autonomy and Enterprise Platform before, that the CDAO is developing. I think that is a very exciting opportunity for – you know, for the department to actually, like, develop a foundation that other autonomous capabilities can plug into. So that, I suspect, is going to keep us very busy over the next year.
You know, we are – we have every year, as you well know, you mentioned Nexus before. On June 13th we’re having our Nexus event, which is going to be at the Kennedy Center. Where we’re going to be talking about all of these things. We’re going to actually showcase some of the technology, the technology that is going into these, you know, autonomous systems, and then discussions around the implications of all of it, you know, from a national security perspective, you know, from a warfighter perspective. It’s going to be really exciting.
Mr. Allen: I had heard Nexus was coming back, and I was really excited for that. But I hadn’t heard it was at the Kennedy Center, which is going to be incredible. And so I can’t wait to attend to myself.
Well, Jason Brown, who it’s very difficult for me to not call you colonel – (laughter) – but, Jason Brown, so glad to have you at CSIS. Thanks very much for taking the time.
Mr. Brown: Thanks so much, Greg.
Mr. Allen: Well, this concludes our event. And thank you all for watching so much. Later this week, we have another event on DOD’s AI adoption. We’re talking with Matt Turek of DARPA about DARPA’s vision for artificial intelligence and autonomy. Thank you all for watching.

55,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/uks-engagement-middle-east-and-north-africa,Will Todman,"March 27, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"Will Todman testified before the House of Commons’ Foreign Affairs Committee as part of its inquiry into the United Kingdom’s engagement with the Middle East and North Africa on March 26, 2024. He argued that the United Kingdom can play a leading role in defining the terms of the next phase of international engagement in Syria. The UK’s interests in the Levant
The UK has a core interest in preventing the collapse of states in the Levant. Syria and Lebanon are the closest to collapse, and each faces severe economic challenges and ongoing political instability. If Syria collapsed, Daesh would likely capitalize on the power vacuum to regroup, Syria would become a venue for increased international competition as actors scramble to secure their security and geopolitical interests (oil fields, military bases etc), and a renewed wave of Syrians would seek refuge in Europe. Numbers of migrants crossing the Channel in small boats would likely spike. If Lebanese security forces collapsed, inter-communal violence would spread, radical Shia and Sunni groups alike would surge, armed groups would force refugees back to Syria, and migrants would attempt to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
Aid cuts to the Levant have undermined the UK’s interests there, as they have contributed to worsening humanitarian conditions and increased the chances of state collapse. The UK cut ODA by 85% in Lebanon and by 70% Syria between 2020 and 2023. The UK lacks deep partnerships with the most consequential actors on the ground. However, the UK can still leverage its relationships and strategic advantages to play a productive role in the region.
The UK’s engagement in the Levant
The prospect of a positive breakthrough in Syria is very low. The tools the UK and its partners have deployed, including sanctions, to facilitate a process for political reform have failed. However, recent normalization agreements between Arab states and Syria have revealed that engaging with the Assad regime is similarly fruitless. Russia and Iran have the most leverage over the regime, but they have shown no interest in wielding that leverage to improve conditions for Syrians.
In the impasse, Syria is becoming more unstable. Daesh is becoming more active in central Syria, protests are spreading in southern Syria once again, and the economic crisis is sharpening. Although the UK should not squander its leverage by unilaterally lifting sanctions, it must pursue new efforts to increase the resilience of communities in Syria to prevent total societal collapse. At the same time, it should continue the slow process of pursuing accountability in international courts.
In Lebanon, the UK is striving to prevent total collapse through security assistance, humanitarian assistance, and efforts to encourage political and economic reform. Security assistance has been effective. It has provided more than £100m to the Lebanese Armed Forces since 2009, with a focus on building border security to prevent spillover from Syria, and it has also trained internal security forces. Despite aid cuts, the UK maintains influence in the humanitarian sector, including by serving as co-chair of the informal donor working group. The UK’s efforts to encourage reform have not yet borne fruit as the Lebanese political elite remains stubbornly unwilling to compromise.
Recommendations
The 2023 Integrated Review Refresh made few references to the Levant. It mentioned Syrians as the third largest national group crossing the Channel and highlighted the enduring threat of Islamist terrorist groups in the region to the UK and its overseas interests. However, several of the broader strategies outlined in the Refresh would allow the UK to engage more productively in the Levant.
The UK government should increase its collaboration with Gulf states in the Levant. Although the UK should not attempt to dictate how Gulf states should intervene in the Levant, it should seek to identify promising avenues for collaboration in pursuit of shared interests. For example, it should deepen its partnership with Qatar on education in Syria and Lebanon and share best practices from its recent interventions in the sector.
The Integrated Review listed climate change and the environment as its first thematic priority, but the UK is insufficiently involved in adaptation efforts in the Levant. Although fragile states represent a challenging context for these interventions, adaptation measures are particularly important where weak governance compounds the effects of climate change. The UK should strive to support more creative environmental projects in the Levant at the local level that are sensitive to conflict dynamics, bolster resilience, and build the foundations of better governance.[1] In doing so, it must resist the impulse to replicate adaptation strategies that worked elsewhere, and instead engage with local civil society groups to advance context-appropriate solutions that account for the region’s unique political, social, and economic challenges. The government should then capitalize on its convening power with other international donors, development actors, and private sector investors to scale up promising interventions.
The UK also has an important opportunity to capitalize on the FCO-DFID merger to become a thought leader on aid interventions in challenging political environments. The UK’s establishment of the Aid Fund for Northern Syria is a promising sign that the government appreciates the political realities of aid access in Syria and the need for novel mechanisms to reach those in need. As international donors begin to look beyond humanitarian assistance despite the lack of progress on the political track, the UK should play a leading role in defining the terms of early recovery in different parts of Syria in the new phase of international engagement. In order to facilitate greater access for aid actors in Syria, the government must make more progress on its derisking strategy and do more to limit financial institutions’ overcompliance with the requirements of sanctions.
The government should also increase its efforts to repatriate British citizens from detention camps for the relatives of Daesh fighters in northeast Syria and support the reintegration of other detainees from Syria and Iraq. U.S. officials described the detention camps as containing a Daesh “army in waiting” and the UK must accelerate efforts to neutralize the threat while the U.S. military still has a presence in the area.

Jon Alterman: Dana Stroul is the director of research at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Until December, she was the deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, the most senior civilian position in the Pentagon looking at the region. Before that, she worked in think tanks, on Capitol Hill, and in the Pentagon in the same office that she led.
Dana, welcome to Babel.
Dana Stroul: Thanks so much, Jon. Pleasure to be with you today.
Jon Alterman: As you were leading the Middle East shop in the Pentagon, where was the Middle East fitting into the broader U.S. strategy in the world?
Dana Stroul: I think we should go back to the beginning of the administration. The Biden administration's National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy talk about China as the major strategic competitor.
The next threat that the National Defense Strategy identified was Russia. For our partners in the Middle East, I think they heard that and said that the United States, and particularly this administration, was deprioritizing the Middle East. What senior leaders articulated in early 2021 and throughout 2022 is that the United States remained invested and committed to this part of the world, but it was going to do it in different ways. So, it was going to focus on diplomacy, not military solutions.
It was going to emphasize de-escalating and winding down conflicts, working with key partners and allies to address political processes and long-term sustainable solutions for those conflicts. It was going to emphasize investing in humanitarian responses for civilians in need in places like Yemen and Syria and elsewhere.
They also articulated that the path to stability and security in the Middle East was going to be through integration. There's been a lot of talk about this idea of integrated deterrence, which is a U.S. whole of government approach, to addressing problems and coordinating across all of our allies and partners.
This means combat-credible investments in militaries and military equipment, military exercising, exchanges of information, and training, but also coordinating economically and diplomatically in the information space. All of this together.
Jon Alterman: Mike Tyson famously said, ""Everybody has a plan until you get punched in the face."" We had a plan, we were executing the plan, and then a lot of things changed. How did that feel in the Middle East shop where we had all these strategic ideas to not be as militarily involved, and then suddenly we were deeply militarily involved?
Dana Stroul: First of all, I’ll share one story. One of my bosses was asked in early 2022, “How many meetings does the National Security Council have per week on a Middle East-related issue?” The answer in 2022 is maybe one or two a month.
Obviously, October 7 changed all of that. Then we were having meetings at the National Security Council on a near-daily basis. Somebody like me, in charge of just the Middle East region in the Pentagon, was seeing Secretary Austin on a daily basis. Developments in the Middle East were absolutely top of the inbox for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Security Advisor, and the Secretary of State.
So absolutely, the best-laid plans have changed. What is lost on a lot of critics of how the administration approached the Middle East in its first and second years is that we actually demonstrated that our strategy is agile and flexible enough to respond to emerging crises and circumstances.
Yes, American leaders and officials here in Washington were focusing on other issues, but they have absolutely been able to shift focus, exercise those diplomatic muscles, increase defense posture in the Middle East, surge military equipment to support Israel, and prevent all-out regional war. To date, that is what happened.
Jon Alterman: The United States invested a lot in trying to increase communication between partner militaries in the region, including with the Israelis who are now part of United States Central Command (CENTCOM). What kinds of things have you seen since October 7 that you thought reflected investments that the United States made? What kinds of investments have you made that had to be paused because of the real outrage in the Arab world over Israel's conduct in this war?
Dana Stroul: I wouldn't call myself an optimist, but here is actually where I think there is a silver lining. Let's go back to what I said about integrated deterrence. Part of that is allies and partners making certain investments that benefit everyone's security, as well as broader security.
Investing in the kinds of equipment that can do shared air defense. What is one of the most pressing immediate security challenges of the Middle East? It's Iranian development of lethal one-way attack drones. Everybody needs to be prepared for this. It turns out the best way to be prepared is not to focus only on your borders, but to create a network system for early warning, to share intelligence, and to expand your air picture.
Those are the kinds of things that the Department of Defense has been working on with our partners in the Middle East. Israel is in the Middle East as well. Certainly, by sharing its technology, its intelligence, the ways in which it detects threats to its population, and its willingness to share that with partners, everyone's security can be enhanced.
That work was going on before October 7. The other big initiative of the Department of Defense is not just in integrated air and missile defense, but in building coalitions to address security threats. Here is a good example: what our navy headquarters, United States Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT), in the Middle East is doing.
They have something called Combined Maritime Forces (CMF). Dozens of nations, not just from the Middle East, but all over the world, come together: ships, sailors, intelligence experts, analysts, liaison officers.
Jon Alterman: There are 41 countries in the Combined Maritime Forces, as I understand it.
Dana Stroul: Absolutely. What they're doing is addressing all the different threats and challenges at sea: piracy, terrorism, illicit trafficking of people, illicit trafficking of weapons, Red Sea security, etc. The military and intelligence coordination between the United States and our partners, including Israel, remains very resilient today. There are no partners in the Middle East who say, ""Even if I am exceptionally frustrated and disappointed in the level of humanitarian suffering in Gaza, it's no longer in my security interest to share intelligence and cooperate on air and missile defense across the region and with Israel."" So, that architecture remains.
There are examples like Operation Prosperity Guardian, which is a presence and monitoring mission in the Red Sea stood up by the United States with partners, and the separate coalition strikes to degrade Houthi capabilities and infrastructure and take weapons off the table so that the Houthis cannot threaten Red Sea maritime security. These are all examples where the United States convened and led the security architecture that is actually still working to this day.
Jon Alterman: As you know, there are only 10 or 11 countries that announced they're part of Prosperity Guardian. I spoke to the French and Egyptian embassies, and they said, ""Well, we’re part of this Combined Maritime Force and we're part of Task Force 153. We don't really understand why there needs to be Prosperity Guardian, and we're not a part of it."" What's the point of having this separate coalition, especially when it seemed that we couldn't get other countries that are affected to join our coalition? They said, ""The work is already ongoing as part of another thing and by the way, we want to have nothing to do with any of your strikes.""
Dana Stroul: This is an example where the United States brings a convening authority to the table, and also a good example of how I think the nomenclature has confused some people. Operation Prosperity Guardian is a temporary task force under this broader structure.
We tell partners, especially under the Combined Maritime Forces that are based out of Bahrain, ""Come as you are, contribute what you can."" Not everyone can contribute the same thing, different navies have different investments, capabilities, levels of priority, sizes, funding levels, etc.
First of all, just being a member of these organizations sends a signal of international commitment, which is important especially when signaling to adversaries.
I would say the other thing that's important to understand about how the United States does this work is that you are right Jon, not every government or every navy or every military wants to be publicly associated with every U.S.-led effort, and we're adaptable and flexible to that. There are a lot of countries that don't want their names on certain lists that are still contributing because most people recognize that Iran-backed Houthi aggression challenging one of the world's most critical and strategic waterways is in nobody's interest.
Jon Alterman: It still seems to me that countries that agree it's not in their interest also say, ""It's not in our interest to align with the United States."" When France was part of Prosperity Guardian, France said, ""We're part of Prosperity Guardian, but we won't be under U.S. command."" As you know, there's a separate European Union task force that just got stood up under Greek command, which operates in parallel with Prosperity Guardian. But there seems to be this reluctance to be too closely associated with the United States, though they certainly benefit from the United States.
Dana Stroul: That's a fair point, and clearly one of the animating challenges at this moment in time is that our allies and partners perceive the United States to have supported Israel in what they view to be an unacceptable level of civilian casualties in Gaza and have contributed and affected this terrible humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Because the Houthis and other Iran-backed groups wrap themselves in the mantle of defending the Palestinian cause, that has prompted some of our partners to seek to put public distance between themselves and their capitals and the United States. That's something the United States is going to have to work through.
On the other hand, the reality is that the Biden administration has been very focused on avenues to expand humanitarian aid delivery, secure the release of hostages, and get to a ceasefire.
This is again the silver lining for somebody who's rarely optimistic. Nobody in the Middle East or Europe is saying there's no role for the United States in addressing peace, security, and stability in the Middle East. if we want to talk about stabilizing Gaza, if we want to talk about increasing humanitarian aid to Gaza, just look at the work the U.S. military is doing now on setting up a maritime option or the airdrops. All the other countries and their airdrops into Gaza wouldn’t happen without the U.S. military.
If it comes to confronting other forms of Iranian aggression, no one is saying that we can do this without the United States. There is significant frustration and tension that we will need to work through with our partners, but no one questions the value added of U.S. military contributions, U.S. diplomats, and what we can bring to bear in terms of resourcing to address the very serious crises that are roiling the region today.
Jon Alterman: I want to get to Iran. But first I want to focus on this issue of partners. You've spent a lot of time trying to build partner relationships in the region. After you were at it for three years, what do you think partners just continue not to understand? What's the piece of the equation you really wish you could convince them of that they don't get yet?
Dana Stroul: One of the most common complaints I heard from our partners was that the United States can't be trusted or is unreliable because our policy changes too much based on who is in the White House, and I think that's fair. There certainly have been very significant swings, and there have been disagreements about many policy objectives and what different administrations identified as achievements of their administration.
But at its core, I think what some of our partners are saying is that, ""We don't like democracy. Because every four to eight years, you guys are going to change, and I'm going to have to get used to a new team, new policies, and understand the new players."" That is different from some of our partners who are not democracies.
Jon Alterman: And they don't especially like democracies, and they don't want democracies in the Middle East as I've certainly heard, and I'm sure you have heard.
Dana Stroul: Absolutely. I try to convey, and hope to continue to convey, in my conversations that there's actually a lot of consistency in administration policy, even though you have such significant swings in personalities, leadership styles, and priorities.
For example, every president has maintained a rather significant U.S. military presence in the Middle East. No president has shut down any of our very significant air bases in the Middle East. No president has stopped the preponderance of U.S. military and economic aid that goes to the Middle East. The top recipients globally are all in the Middle East, except in the last two years with Ukraine. Our best ambassadors, our most sophisticated military equipment, our resources, and the investment in people, personnel, our young men and women, are going to the Middle East, and there actually haven't been considerable changes in that investment.
So, while I think a lot of leaders focus on the rhetoric either coming from our Congress or the White House, the investments have actually remained relatively stable. Our partners are going to have to get used to the idea that we're going to change every four to eight years, and that democracies and elected members of the U.S. government and in the U.S. Congress are responsive to constituents and American voters. Americans have views on how our precious resources and where our service members should go, and that's different than a non-democratic system of government.
Jon Alterman: I'm sure there were things that continued to puzzle you after being in this job. What do you wish you understood about our partners? What are the mysteries that, with all the resources you had, you just have a hard time wrapping your head around?
Dana Stroul: There was a point in 2022 when I was worried that our partnerships in the Middle East were going to unravel, and it came down to what many in Washington saw as equivocating on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Here in Washington our Cabinet-level officials and people inside the administration and Congress were working to hold the line. If you don't stop this kind of aggression in Europe, it will certainly embolden adversaries in other theaters that might think the world isn't going to muster the political will and the resources to defend in another theater if an adversary seeks to use force to remake borders.
Clearly, I'm talking about China in the Asia Pacific and about Iran in the Middle East. From a Washington DC perspective, people thought in a very clear black-and-white way that surely our partners in the Middle East would decide to stand on the right side of history because the rules-based international order benefits our partners in the Middle East. They should want to uphold that order.
Secondly, when you look at the China example, there's ample evidence that a 5G system coming from Huawei or military purchases coming from Beijing are forms of leverage that Beijing may seek to cash in on later. For our partners who care so much about their sovereignty, why wouldn't you take certain actions to insulate your security, your sovereignty, or the U.S. partnership by taking actions to impose costs on Russia or to say to China, ""these are certain areas where we're not going to work with you because it threatens our partnership with the United States""?
Our partners hear that and say, ""This isn't a zero-sum game, I'm not going to pick."" I actually think, from a Washington perspective, we say ""We're not asking you to pick,"" but there are categories of activities where we are asking you to take a firm stance. In many cases, our partners aren't taking that stance, and they're pursuing what they believe to be their own interests in their own way. We just have a difference of views of what's in their security interest.
I'll tie it all in a bow now. Russia is not a European problem. Russia is now continuing to target and kill Ukrainians with weapons supplied by Iran. The Russians are also turning to North Korea for weapons. We know that the Chinese are contemplating also supplying the Russians. There's an emerging axis of Russians, Iranians, Chinese, and North Korean cooperation and coordination that challenges the very nature of a world order that most of us have benefited from.
Jon Alterman: There's a perception that Israel is using American weapons to destroy Gazan infrastructure to kill tens of thousands of Palestinians with, at best, indifference to civilian suffering. Then there are more contentious assessments of what the Israelis are doing with continued American support, and that when we talk about a rules-based order, there's a profound hypocrisy on the U.S. side for saying, ""The rules-based order applies to the way Russia conducts the war, but it doesn't apply to the way Israel conducts a war.""
I've certainly heard a lot of that. I'm sure you've heard even more. What I haven't heard is a persuasive rebuttal that the United States recognizes the tension and is actively moving to resolve it.
Dana Stroul: I think that's how many of our partners see it, and I think that's a very convenient narrative about what's happening for our partners. So, the point of U.S. partnership is that we don't abandon our partners. Russia’s unprovoked decision to declare war and invade Ukraine—that’s not what happened in Gaza and Israel. First, there was a vicious and unprecedented Hamas terror attack in Israel. Number two is that the United States can walk and chew gum at the same time. Yes, there are significant concerns here in Washington, and, having sat in a lot of these meetings with the Biden administration, officials are absolutely concerned about the humanitarian situation and the level of civilian casualties.
But the way to address that is not to break a partnership or stop all military support to that partner. Frankly, most of our partners have experienced that same tension over Washington policy. We could talk about the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. The United States never abandoned our partners who were seeking to restore the legitimate government in Yemen despite accusations that that's what happened. We also stood up a significant coalition in Iraq and Syria and exercised and articulated very serious concerns about the ways in which aspects of those campaigns were executed. But the United States doesn't just abandon a partner, and there is nuance in that approach.
Without question, there should be concern by our partners about civilian casualties and the humanitarian toll. But what they don't say publicly, and what they're willing to talk about privately, is that they want Hamas to be dismantled and that no military has confronted the nature of the operational challenges that the Israeli defense forces have in Gaza. I think privately, a lot of them recognize that in any of the campaigns that they undertook, they weren't dealing with a terrorist organization that had close to 20 years to dig a network of terror tunnels and completely embed itself in the civilian infrastructure and fabric of Gaza.
Jon Alterman: As a final area of discussion, it seems to me that through much of your career in this space, how the United States thinks about victory has probably changed. In 2003, we thought we were going to have a clean victory in Iraq, and we thought we were going to have a clean victory in Afghanistan. We’ve had not only a whole series of different postures in Iraq but we've been involved in Syria. Now we're looking at a close ally, Israel, which says we have to have victory because victory is necessary for our survival.
As you think about how the United States has changed the way it thinks about victory, do you think we've come to any sort of conclusions, and are any of those relevant to the Gaza environment?
Dana Stroul: I do, and the clearest articulation that comes to mind is Secretary Austin at the Reagan National Security Forum last year in December. What he talked about is Israel's focus on tactical victory while losing the strategic war. What he meant by that is, we have had to reconceptualize what victory looks like. It is not clear, it's muddy, and it's messy. Frankly, in areas where we've had significant boots on the ground fighting terrorist forces, like ISIS or Al-Qaeda, how the story ends is actually still being told now in places like Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan. But what we in the United States have learned is that there is no victory that's “military only”. If you do not attend to the needs of the population and immediately begin planning for when the active part of a campaign ends—what happens in that space immediately after the fighting ends, before you can do major reconstruction, before you clear out the rubble? If you're not thinking and planning for that, then victory is absolutely at risk.
A lot of the conversation with Israel now is on what is militarily necessary or sufficient so that Hamas cannot return to having a governing stranglehold on Gaza. But if you do not prioritize the needs of the civilians in Gaza, then Israel’s security will never be assured either. I think those are some tough lessons that we, in the U.S. military learned. An idea we hear from a lot of Israelis is that we're not going to deal with the day after right now. “We just want to focus on degrading Hamas” is actually not the way to achieving anything that will deliver security for Israel.
Jon Alterman: Well, what I hear more from Israelis is we've been in conflict with Palestinians for a century, and the Americans have an idea that there's a way to undermine Palestinian hostility. The Israeli view is, for the most part, ""We're going to have to manage enduring Palestinian hostility and make sure that they never have the ability to challenge Israel."" How do we deal with a partner that just doesn't accept the idea that you can win Palestinian public opinion over, which it seems to me is vital to the construct you've described for what a successful outcome looks like?
Dana Stroul: Well, I think you heard President Biden articulate that pretty clearly in the State of the Union. Even if it's something that an Israeli audience doesn't want to hear right now, in the near-term trauma of the post-October 7 world, the reality is, if we're not addressing those long-term factors that contribute to perpetual instability in the West Bank or Gaza, then Israel and Israelis won't have the security that they want to live their lives in Israel. There needs to be changes in policies by the government in Jerusalem that serve the security of the Israeli people. Part of that is addressing the humanitarian situation in Gaza. Number two: beginning to plan for what “the day after” in Gaza looks like because you can't just leave it the way it is and hope for the best.
On the West Bank side, there will need to be attention paid to addressing the economy, addressing the lack of hope of young Palestinians in the West Bank, and their economy that is at a standstill. In no way is this a recipe for enduring stability. This is clearly a conversation that is going to become sharper over the course of this year.
Jon Alterman: What I've heard from the Israeli side is Americans assume that some problems have solutions, and some problems just don't have solutions. You have to manage them as best you can. As somebody who has had a number of conversations with Israeli government officials before and after October 7, is there a way to persuade Israelis that there are solutions to this? Is there a way to persuade them that solutions will require taking risks now for a long-term benefit, even though the Israeli view is that the risks they took after Oslo neither improved Israelis’ lives nor Palestinians’ lives?
Dana Stroul: We need to acknowledge the trauma of October 7. The idea that there would be an immediate recognition of a Palestinian state absent reform, anti-corruption, demilitarization, and all of these issues—is not going to make Israelis feel safe. First of all, I think we need to think through how we communicate, and not dictate, to Israel what our report card is for their security. Secondly, I would observe from my conversations with Israelis that yes, that's what you hear right now, but just like in our government, there's a diversity of views and there's a recognition that perpetual instability, economic strain, lack of opportunity, and no confidence in the government in Ramallah doesn't actually serve Israeli security interests.
I think what we need to think about over time is communicating what is good for Israel's security, and that the status quo or returning to the status quo ante is not going to be good for Israel's security. By no means am I going to tell you that I think this is easy, or quick, or straightforward, but this has to be a conversation about Israeli security. Any intelligence or military analyst or expert who assesses conditions that are ripe for further violence would look at the situation in the West Bank or Gaza and say, ""This is not the making for long-term stability.""
Jon Alterman: Dana Stroul, thank you very much for joining us on Babel.
Dana Stroul: My pleasure.

57,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/conversation-aukus-army-chiefs-land-powers-contribution-aukus-pillar-2,Unknown,"March 11, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS event hosted on March 11, 2024. Watch the full video here. Seth G. Jones: Welcome, everyone. Welcome to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. My name is Seth Jones, Vice President here. And welcome, more importantly, to “A Conversation with the AUKUS Army Chiefs on Land Power’s Contribution to AUKUS Pillar 2.”
AUKUS, which was first announced in September of 2021 is a trilateral U.S., U.K., Australia defense partnership, which includes two pillars – Pillar 1 and Pillar 2. I’ll let Dr. Charles Edel talk more about that. But last year, the Australian, British, and U.S. army chiefs signed a statement of intent identifying capabilities of priority for cooperation across the three countries. This effort is intended to contribute to the broader work under AUKUS Pillar 2.
So in this panel discussion, which I’ll hand off to Charlie, U.S. General Randy George, U.S. General – U.K. General Sir Patrick Sanders, and Australian Lieutenant General Simon Stuart will discuss AUKUS Pillar 2 from a land domain perspective and how the three armies can work together to enhance collaborative efforts in capability developments. Charlie, over to you.
Charles Edel: Great. Well, thank you very much, Seth. Thanks, everyone, for joining us here today, all our distinguished guests that we have, and for those of you who are tuning in online for this discussion about AUKUS and how it intersects with land power. I’m thrilled to have the three AUKUS army chiefs from Australia, from the United Kingdom, and from the United States here with us today.
When AUKUS came out, as Seth just described in September of 2021, everyone immediately fastened on Pillar 1. That is the nuclear-powered, conventionally armed submarines. That was what AUKUS looked like. So, naturally, it had a maritime dimension and focus to it. But AUKUS, of course, is broader than that. And it’s evolved over the past two-plus years. In fact, it continues to evolve about both what it is and what it might become. And that really brings us to our conversation here today.
Now, Seth had mentioned Pillar 2. Pillar 2 is an initiative to really hone, push, and forge collaboration between the three nations in advanced technologies, whether we’re talking about hypersonic missiles, quantum, artificial intelligence, unmanned vehicles, or a range of other options.
Really, that is what AUKUS is. But understanding that has been a bit of a challenge thus far. And to really discuss what opportunities Pillar 2 might bring, to discuss the emerging challenges in the Indo-Pacific theater and how land power is situated to meet those challenges, and really hone in on this particular configuration – Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States – and why it’s so critical in this theater, I’m beyond honored to have the three Army chiefs here.
Lieutenant General Simon Stuart has been the Australian Chief of Army since July of 2022, bringing 35 years of experience and command at every level, from the company to the joint task force to the brigade to the force level, and having served in East Timor, Afghanistan, Egypt, and Israel. And most recently, before this role, he served as the lead of land capabilities in Army headquarters.
Next to him I have General Sir Patrick Sanders, who has been the Chief of the British Army since June of 2022 and has over 38 years of service and command experience in Northern Ireland, in Kosovo, in Bosnia, in Iraq, and Afghanistan.
Finally, last, but certainly not least, General Randy George, who assumed duties as the 41st Chief of Staff of the Army in September of 2023, prior to that serving as the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army. He was commissioned as an infantry officer in 1988 from West Point and has previously served in Italy, in Iraq, and Afghanistan.
We’re going to hear some initial thoughts. I’ll run the conversation for a little while, but very eager to make sure that we go out to the audience for questions. That means both people who are online – you can register questions directly through our portal – but also for those of you in the room too.
Let me turn to you first, General Stuart. And I’m hoping that you can begin this conversation by telling us how the Australian Army is really thinking about the transformation that it needs to undergo to meet the new types of challenges that we’re seeing in the Indo-Pacific region.
Lieutenant General Simon Stuart: Thanks, Charlie.
If I might just begin by thanking CSIS for hosting this today and to Seth for the introduction, to you, Charlie, and also to my friends and counterparts and everybody that’s turned out today.
Just last year the Australian government commissioned a very detailed review called the Defense Strategic Review and then issued very clear direction to the Department of Defense and the ADF. And it’s probably worth just taking a moment to sketch out the context. It, as would be familiar to my counterparts, recognized that in an era of great-power competition, defense and security is once again a whole-of-nation endeavor. But even more so, it requires us to work even more closely and in a more integrated fashion with allies and with partners.
As military professionals, our greatest challenge is balancing the enduring human nature of warfare with its ever-changing character. And that ever-changing character is absolutely dominated by technological advancement at pace. And so really the challenge for us is how do we adapt at a speed that is relevant. And very clearly, by working together, we can achieve the sort of tempo, the sort of speed and the sort of outcomes that we all need.
My job, of course, as the Chief of Army, is to maximize the value proposition of land power and the contribution that armies and land power make to the combined multidomain force, or the integrated force, as we describe it.
And if I can just quickly, you know, sketch out what that value proposition looks like, five key elements – we can go into them in a bit more detail later – but presence. Land forces are present among populations. They can understand the environment.
They are persistent. They can consolidate gains across the integrated force. They can provide reassurance for partners and they can contribute to deterrence through their persistent effect.
Asymmetry. In the Indo-Pacific region the A2/AD complexes are optimized to defeat air and maritime forces so how do we leverage the asymmetric effect of standing land forces that are distributed, that are survivable, that are sustainable. And, of course, the ability to support our navy and maritime forces in their maneuver by applying maritime fires from the land and expand the options there.
The fourth is versatility. You can take almost any army unit or formation and it can perform a very broad range of tasks from humanitarian assistance and disaster relief through combat operations.
And, fifthly, and I think particularly importantly in today’s climate we are really good value for money. You get a lot of bang for the buck out of armies and out of land forces. So a relatively inexpensive way of generating that value proposition.
From an Australian army perspective, I’m part of an ADF that has been directed to move from being a joint force to an integrated force. Quite simply, that means joint force converges in effect. An integrated force is something you do to very deliberately and consciously design an integrated force so it’s more than the sum of its parts.
We’ve been directed to move from a balanced to a focused force and that means prioritizing, and very clearly AUKUS Pillar 1 is a great example of that prioritization, and the army I’m privileged to lead has been directed to optimize for littoral maneuver operations.
And if I may just finish on that, whenever you mention littoral people immediately think of ships, boats, watercraft. They are absolutely central and important and vital, but it’s actually about maneuver and advantage for the multi-domain force.
The littorals are a couple of hundred kilometers either side of the beach, the air above that space, the electromagnetic spectrum that operates within it, and the space capabilities that can be applied within it. So it’s how do you better leverage positional advantage for that integrated or combined multi-domain force.
And so our adaptation or transformation is all about very quickly filling the gap between where we are today and our capabilities, where we need to be in the future, long-range precision fires, the ability to draw on a persistent sensor network, to decide at machine speed, and to be able to maneuver in those littorals but also to maintain the capability for the close fight – the combined arms fight – which is often the decisive phase in any battle and campaign.
Dr. Edel: Thanks very much.
One of the things that you had said, which I hope maybe we can draw out a little bit more, is the shift, as you rightly noted, highlighted in the Defense Strategic Review about different suite of challenges than we had previously so, therefore, a different type of force – no longer balanced across to everything but focused against a particular type of challenge.
So, hopefully, we can pull that thread a little bit more. But things look similar but not the same in a different part of the world.
General Sanders, really, with the army fully invested in European security, quite obviously, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how you see the British army evolving against the backdrop of what’s happening in Europe and then on top of that, because it is on top of that, what is the role for the British army in the Indo-Pacific?
General Sir Patrick Sanders: Well, thanks, Charles. And it’s – I mean, as Simon said, it’s a huge honor to be here sharing a platform with the British army’s two closest partner armies and two close personal friends in Randy and Simon as well.
Unlike many I have spent much of my operational career serving alongside U.S. and Australian soldiers. It’s also a signal honor to be here. You’re described as the finest defense and national security think tank in the world – that’s quite a place to be sitting – and this feels timely.
We can see threats proliferating at a scale and a pace and a vector that we probably haven’t seen for 80 years or more. It’s not beyond the realms of possibility that these threats begin to metastasize together. And it’s timely, in the sense that time is surely the most critical strategic resource that we have in the face of these threats. And so it is so important to begin to restore deterrence. And that’s about magazine depth. It’s about warfighting competitive edge. And it’s about partners. And that is what is at the heart of AUKUS. And for us, AUKUS Pillar 2.
So I thought I’d just talk a little bit about strategy, about Ukraine, about land power, and what we’re doing about it. On strategy, I always tend to go back to George Kennan. I think that it’s hugely resonant with the Euro-Atlantic area at the moment, but more widely as well. And from that, we need to relearn the nuances of the strategies of containment, of deterrence, and coercion. But it’s also clear that we no longer have the luxury of treating means as something that is discretionary, because a lack of strategic means will ruthlessly undermine the ends that we’re pursuing. And we need, in that context, just to remind ourselves that Russia is currently spending 40 percent of public expenditure on defense and security.
So that draws us to Ukraine. And Ukraine – and I’ll say this unashamedly – Ukraine really matters. I mean, this is the greatest geostrategic catastrophe for the free world, arguably, since World War II. It is the principal pressure point on a really fragile world order. And it is about – it is about a few thousand hectares of fertile land in eastern Ukraine. But it’s about much more than that, too. This is a concerted attempt to defeat our system, our way of life politically, psychologically, and symbolically. And I think Ukraine is the test for our generation.
And how we respond to that test is going to reverberate through history, because Russian aggression cannot stand. Because if we fail, if you contemplate what failure looks like, we end up with a world that is – that we bequeath to our children and our grandchildren that is infinitely more unstable, infinitely more perilous, where autocracies have been emboldened, and our collective deterrence and security has been weakened. So for now, Ukrainian blood, and we should be clear about that, and bravery is buying time. But they need our support. And it’s not just morally right to do that. It is in our own self-interest, because preserving our future security by supporting Ukraine is much better value than fighting a war.
And then thirdly, just turning to land power, I mean, I’m an army chief. So I’m going to advocate for my domain, not in zero-sum terms. But it is an inescapable fact that land is where people live. It’s where human affairs are settled. It took a great naval strategist, Julian Corbett, to remind us that, except in the rarest of cases, the great affairs of state are settled on land. And its where wars are concluded. And I think, Simon was saying, that it is growing in relative value as a domain. Because as we see projectile ranges and precision increasing, the large capital platforms in the other domains are at risk.
And you can mitigate this by thinking cross domain, because cross-domain effects are more deliverable than ever. And, as Simon said, land platforms are disposable, dispersible, survivable, and they’re cheap. They’re really good value. And they allow you to unlock challenges in much more constrained and contested maritime and air domains. And that’s as applicable to the Euro-Atlantic area as it is to the Indo-Pacific.
So what does all this mean for us? Well, I’m frequently guided by Dr. Jack Watling. I’ll give him a chuck up because I think he’s becoming a national treasure. Works at RUSI, if you haven’t been there. And he writes that if the fundamental elements of the character of war are changing – as Simon was saying – then armies have to transform and not just optimize. And we are going through, as an army, the most profound transformation of my career. It’s guided – our North Star, if you like, is an operating concept – a land operating concept that is the most significant, tested, and peer-reviewed of any concept that we’ve produced in more than a generation.
The context it describes is happening right now. And the principal deductions and recommendations that you draw from that have to be applied to the force right now. But the processes that we have for design, for acquisition, are based on an orderly, measured cascade of ideas, and then very stately approvals processes. And we’re operating in series rather than in parallel. And we have to transform that. And it can be the only approach. And that transformation demands a leap of faith. It demands ruthless prioritization, a willingness to discard all those old structures and old ideas, and a tolerance of risk, including financial risks, that feels counterintuitive when you are husbanding taxpayer resource.
What does all that mean for us? As you said, NATO is our north star, but it’s not exclusive in the way that you implied. Indeed, the U.K.’s largest and most persistent presence, to use two of the characteristics that Simon described, in the Indo-Pacific are land. We have a joint task force which operates alongside the U.S., the Australians, and other partners across the Indo-Pacific. And the Indo-Pacific – a free and open Indo-Pacific – is in the U.K.’s strategic long-term interests.
And Pillar 2 of AUKUS allows us to develop high-end capabilities that will enhance deterrence, yes, in the Indo-Pacific, but it’s applicable across all theaters. And the way we think about how we design that force is really guided by four values: height, breadth, depth, and edge.
So height is about our convening power as a multidomain integrator, as Simon was describing, and as a leader across NATO. So, if you like, that’s about growing core-level capabilities.
Breadth is about broadening our strategic utility, and therefore offering greater choice, more options for government. And that’s generally growing capabilities at the formation level, including a global presence – persistent presence in the Indo-Pacific.
Depth is about magazine depth. It’s our ability to endure through conflict, particularly through people and stockpiles.
And edge are those things that contribute most to warfighting competitiveness.
So, for us, AUKUS Pillar 2 is predominantly about edge, because it’s the – it’s the cutting-edge joint cross-domain technologies; and it’s about breadth, probably best represented by the multidomain taskforce that Simon and I have been invited to contribute to, and we will. So those are the things that we’re wrestling with, how do we balance those four values. And I’m happy to unpack them further in questions, but I’ll stop there.
Dr. Edel: Terrific. Thank you. I was really struck by your comment about what Ukrainian blood has purchased for everyone else, which is time. And so the question, obviously, becomes: Time to do what and acquire what and set ourselves up for what? We’ll pull on that a little bit, too.
General George, this past week you’ve been hosting two of our closest allies. I’m really curious if you might kick us off with your thoughts about how the U.S. Army is thinking about collaborating with two of its closest allies in order to drive some of this future collaboration that we just heard described.
General Randy A. George: Sure. And, first, it’s great to be up here with my teammates, and we’ve had a really good couple of days of conversations.
So I could repeat a lot of the things, I think, that Simon and Patrick both said about the environment. And just when I’m out talking to our commanders, I mean, for 36 years in the Army I don’t think I’ve seen the change that I’ve seen, you know, that’s happening in our world over the last – just the last couple of years. And we always say that the world is complex. We’ve been saying that, I think, forever. And I think the difference is, as Patrick suggested, is it’s also very volatile. I mean, any regional – I don’t think anything now is regional anymore. It could be a spark that could set things off. So a lot of the discussions that we’ve been having are a big focus area for us inside the Army, and that’s how we transform and how do we – how do we change.
And I have four – we have four big focus areas in the Army.
Warfighting, to make sure that we’re always focused on building lethality and building cohesive teams. And we want our formation to know that up and down.
Delivering ready combat formations are important for the Army because – and we – for the U.S. Army, we’re a global army. We just – just this last weekend, we sent 7th Transportation Brigade over to the Middle East to help, you know, set up the port there in Gaza. So we got to be ready to do anything.
And Army is a big part, for us, for Army Materiel Command and everything we do for the – you know, organic industrial base. Patrick mentioned magazine depth, and that’s critically important. You know, we had a lot of discussions on that.
I think the big thing that we all – all three of us realize is that, you know, the old model of where you would, you know, put something out and say you had to change and maybe look at a system coming online in three, four, or five years, I think that we – you know, that we have to be quicker than that. And so what we talk about in the U.S. Army is continuous transformation. And what we’re – we’re seeing all the lessons that we’re learning from the Ukraine or the Middle East, you really can’t hide anymore, you know, with all the sensors that you have out there, the UAS that’s out there. Everybody in here is in probably a million cellphone photos. I mean, there’s really no hiding, you know, that’s out there right now. And that has implications for what we’re – you know, how we’re going to have to transform.
Commercial tech is moving much quicker than military tech in a lot of areas. And so we had a lot of, you know, conversations about that. I think people are moving to cities. Combat’s moving to cities. And, you know, that will have implications on what your force, what your capabilities are, and how you’re going to do those things.
So we’ve really been focused on that. And it’s a lesson observed, I think, until you actually make changes inside your service to whatever you’re doing, with changing how you operate. And this is what we’re talking about. We have to change how we operate on the battlefield. We know that, for example, you can’t have these big C2 nodes, command-and-control nodes, that we’ve had. You’re going to have to be dispersed, small, very low signature that’s out there, or you’re going to get killed on the battlefield. And we have to transform how that looks.
We are going to – we talked a lot about unmanned systems and what we can do to partner in that area. And that’s also tech that is moving really fast, and we have to figure that out; same with countering unmanned systems that are counter-UAS. And I think we’ve also seen just what missile technology – and I think this gets to the cost-effective, what we can do with PrSM, for example, one of our systems that can – you know, how far that can reach. It’s very, very difficult to target land-based fires. And I think we’ve seen that over in Ukraine. They can hide, they can move, and they’re very effective, and just what that will do to contribute to the joint force.
So we’re busy in the Army, but we have to continuously transform. And what we’re doing is undertaking, is using every advantage that we have together as AUKUS nations, to use exercises for us to transform. We were just out at Project Convergence, all three of us working together and making advancements. And, you know, what we’re calling it in the U.S. Army is transforming in contact. We’re going to have to transform in Europe. We’re going to have to transform formations that are in the Middle East and we’re going to have to transform units that are out in the Pacific. And so we just have to have that culture, that innovation mindset. And we spent a lot of time talking about what we can do together to get momentum in those areas.
Dr. Edel: Perfect. Thanks very much.
If I can go back now to all of you, really. It’s something that all of you have touched upon. General George, you just gave us an example that it’s very hard to find distributed land forces. And so one of the things that I’d really like to draw out on this conversation is how do you think about, how should we think about, how land power contributes both to a combined fight, joint fight, in a theater that is predominantly water-based?
General George, would you start us off on that?
Gen. George: Yeah. I think you’re not going to win a war, you know, from the sea. I don’t think you’re going to win a war from the air. I’m certainly not saying that you would just from the land. I mean, I think that there’s no such thing as, you know, a maritime theater, for example. I think these are joint theaters. And it’s going to take everybody’s capability to do that. We certainly appreciate and we absolutely – you know, it’s going to have to be a joint team, and the Navy for the global commons.
But what – I think you just said it. What you can do with long-range fires and, you know, distributed forces that are out there in whatever environment, whether it’s the Pacific or anywhere else, I think, is going to be the difference; same with – it’s going to come down to, I think – it typically does – to a close fight in the streets, to – you know, people are living – and I think Patrick or Simon said that – people are living on the land. Command-and-control nodes are on the land in cities. And so I think it’s going to be the whole joint team that’s going to have to be successful out there.
Dr. Edel: Would you like to add to that at all? I’m trying to think, too, about this, about more capabilities, more attributes that we’re looking for, particularly that we’ve learned over the last couple years. I mean, this is a question that I got from several folks incoming that all three of you have talked about transformation, but we’ve had transformation shoved in our face with not one but two wars that we’re watching play out now. Things that we didn’t think were possible – for instance, the Ukrainians, who have no navy, sinking and destroying the Russian Navy – are transforming how we think about not only war but about power and the capabilities that we need to acquire.
So, General Sanders, if I can ask you about this, can I ask you to pull a little bit about both innovation and technology that we’ve seen flowing out of Ukraine and the conflicts in the Middle East? Particularly, you know, one example of this is kind of increased ways, as you were talking about our phones, but how it is that we detect and target forces? How does that apply to a much larger theater across a maritime realm, but that will come in the form of land power.?
Gen. Sanders: So Ukraine points to a combination of regression and progression. A lot of the lessons that you see come out of Ukraine remind us, as Simon was saying, about this simply being the nature of war. You know, we are – you could see the same things – scenes that could have been at Antietam, could have been from the First World War. Those are playing out right in front of our eyes. And those facets of war I don’t think will change. But we’re also seeing, as you’re hinting at, extraordinary progressive, almost revolutionary change in some of the character of war.
And perhaps the most revolutionary aspect to this is what you could almost describe as a Cambrian explosion of autonomous systems. Now, not all of them are working effectively. So up to 80 percent of the drones during one period, recently, simply were not getting through because of an extraordinarily contested electromagnetic spectrum and effective Russian use of electronic warfare. But I think this does point to a very, very significant change. And that, of course, is enabled by data, and being able to freely flow data from sensors through to deciders through to effectors, and across all domains.
And just last week in Camp Pendleton, you saw a perfect example of that where we were able to take data from an Air Force sensor – which we previously wouldn’t have been able to do not least because of levels of classification – and exchange it and pass it through a decider, and then to an effector, both a British effector and an Australian effector. And the Australian effector was actually located in Australia. And that was done at machine speeds. So you can see how the range – you combine that with the sort of rate precision, the ability to use ubiquitous sensors, and the ranges and the precision that we can achieve with multidomain effectors.
So a land-based missile, PrSM, being fired out of a 30,000 – not 100 million – $30,000 platform, which is hard to find. Can reach out to previously unthinkable distances and target a maritime platform. So that gives you a sense of how I think the innovation that we’re seeing feeding – you know, being developed in places like Ukraine, has got direct transfer and applicability into the Indo-Pacific.
Dr. Edel: Yeah. I really like these concrete examples that you’ve offered up for us, that we can see bespoke capabilities in the EW domain, in the fires and in the data sharing and transfer that we have. Is there a relative kind of pecking order for which types of capabilities we want to go after first? Or is it all the above? How do you think about this in Canberra?
Lt. Gen. Stuart: Well, I don’t think we can afford, nor do we have the time, to be, as Patrick said, operating in series rather than parallel. So we – certainly starting from, I think it was the 26th president of United States that said: Do what you can, with what you have, where you are. And that’s a good starting point, because we can actually do quite a lot more with what exists already today. But I do think it’s fair to say – and a lot of our conversations over the last sort of couple of days have come back to our ability to share data at machine speed.
So, you know, how do we communicate and share data? Because to actually deliver on the theory of any and every sensor, any decider, and the best effector, and then the optimal sustainer, you need to be able to operate at machine speed, and you need to get the right data in the right place at the right classification. So that – you know, if we were to look at what some of the central priorities are, I think, you know, what we would previously have called the network is really at the heart of digital-age warfare in all domains but particularly in the land domain.
Then I’d say – and both Randy and Patrick have mentioned this – long-range precision fires. Now, a little bit like littoral maneuver, when you say long-range precision fires one thinks of a missile. That’s the – that’s the penultimate step in that kill web. So it’s ensuring that when you strike, you can also shield. So what does our own protection look like in terms of integrated air and missile defense? But the gamechanger from a land-domain contribution to that combined multidomain force is the ability to apply fires at strategic and operationally relevant ranges. And that, I think, as an addition to that joint force is particularly powerful.
So I’d say those two things, I think, are probably central to the value proposition of land power. But the other things we’ve been talking about – you know, the ability to sustain contested logistics; the ability to apply autonomy – resilient autonomy at scale both on the ground and in the air to achieve human-machine teaming that give us scaling and mass advantages; but also, because our people are our most valuable asset, how do we move them away from the point of contact. I do not want to be putting our soldiers into a fair fight. I do not want to be trading blood in the encounter battle if we can put machines out front to do that.
Dr. Edel: Yeah. But it’s more than machines, right, because we’ve said we don’t want a fair right; we want a manifestly unfair fight that tilts in our favor. And so the question is – and I think you’ve underscored this really well – is, how does AUKUS – how do these three nations working together become more than the sum of its parts? I think you’ve given us really interesting examples about how this becomes additive, right – what the U.K. learns all of a sudden is pushed out to U.S. operators; what Australia can see all of a sudden gets integrated into a larger system here. I’m not sure, General Sanders, if this aligns with the first of the pillars that you were talking about, about height – that we stack on top of each other and we have more breadth than we might otherwise here.
But I do really want to drill down, if I might, for the challenges that we’re facing. I won’t get into the – one of the Washington games we play here, which is at what date precisely are we most concerned. It doesn’t matter, because we are concerned. I think that’s a point that we underscore. But when we look about the decade of challenge – critical challenge that we find ourselves facing and emanating from Beijing as they go through a rapid military modernization, I guess the question that I have here is, how do we feel – (laughs) – not “we,” how do all of you feel about the speed with which you see AUKUS coming online and bringing combat capability to bear? Is it delivering deterrence fast enough, given the scope of the challenge that we’re facing? And what can we do to help accelerate this further? All three of you talked about timing and speed and the timeline that we face this challenge. General George?
Gen. George: Yeah. I know I would say we want to go faster. That would be my – you know, would be my answer. And we have given very specific examples.
To give another example, you know, I think a lot of this with this partnership is that we get the ingenuity from three great countries and, you know, all that industry together. You know, coming forward as a specific example, we were talking about UAS – unmanned systems, that we would – we could have a common controller and we could exchange systems and do things. So I think that there’s ways that we’re figuring that out.
Specific to where I’m at, you know, and one of the things that I think we need to do better, is consolidate some of our funding lines. This is something we’re going to have to do inside the Army, but also, you know, with a little bit of help. And I’ve talked to folks on the Hill about this, is that I think we need to be a little bit more flexible with our – with how we buy things so we can, you know, do things very quickly.
What the unmanned systems – what’s happening in electronic warfare EMS is changing every three weeks or three months and has the ability to update systems, to update software, and to do things more rapidly.
I think we need to be able to move from research and development to procurement, you know, very rapidly and that’s been very hard for us to do right now, for example, with the Continuing Resolution as far as moving things around. So I think that we have to speed our buying models a little bit to get after that.
Dr. Edel: General Sanders, how are we doing on our timeline here?
Gen. Sanders: So I think it’s probably – I mean, if you take an optimistic spin to begin with, you know, Pillar 1 is not going to deliver for decades. This is a very, very long time frame.
Dr. Edel: The full suite of Pillar 1 won’t deliver for decades. We know that it’s supposed to start showing up in two years, though, in Australia.
Gen. Sanders: The Pillar 2 you will deliver – I mean, from the land contribution, the land of opportunities that we can exploit in Pillar 2, you can be delivering next year. So when it comes to pace this is the best opportunity you have to inject pace into AUKUS and, critically, to begin to restore that commitment to deterrence that we’ve been talking about.
What I pick up on – so I don’t want to describe all of the impediments because we face all kinds. We face many. But I think the one I would pick up on most is the ability to share data.
It’s the single most important enabler to allow us to co-develop, you know, co-produce and co-sustain the sort of capabilities that we’re talking about, because if you can feed the data around and then also do it in a way that allows you in a more limited way to bring in other partners as well, then that’s where the pace will come from.
Dr. Edel: These inhibitors, too, are collaborating more closely than they have. General Sanders described this as the need for all of our countries to assume more risk than we have before. That’s true at every level. But if we assume more risk here, we get more things more quickly.
Again, I know I’ve asked this before but I’m keying off something that General Sanders just said about AUKUS Pillar 2 has the ability, comma, potentially to start delivering immediately. I think you said last year.
There’s a range of things that constitute Pillar 2. It’s both broad and somewhat hard to hang your hat on. So I guess I would ask if we want to start delivering deterrence effects immediately is do you agree with this that it’s data sharing as priority number one?
What should we be acquiring now or in the next 12 months that kind of add to the deterrence equation that we don’t have right now?
Lt. Gen. Stuart: Sure. If I can answer in two parts and just kind of go back to your original question.
At the outset I said in an era of great-power competition, defense and security are a whole-of-nation endeavor, whole-of-government endeavor, and so it’s going to require us to change our systems and processes. And I certainly know that in Canberra colleagues across government and, indeed, across industry are working on their part of the equation.
For me, I have an obligation to make sure that we’re good stewards of taxpayers’ money, but also to change what we can within our army. And so instead of starting the process of delivering a capability with the platform – let’s take watercraft, for example – that’s the last thing that I’ll be able to deliver to our soldiers. They’re already training. We’ve already written the concepts. We’re already working with our joint partners and, indeed, our combined partners – with the Marine Rotational Force in Darwin, the Compass watercraft company out of USARPAC, for the last three years to demonstrate operational maneuver across the north of Australia. You know, we are reskilling our people. The first seven skippers of those first watercraft are working – are being trained by our navy today in that partnership. So that capability – and we’re using, you know, civilian lease hire, you know, watercraft to emulate and simulate and provide some capability. So the last thing we’ll deliver will be the major platform, which is completely the opposite of how we’ve previously done things, where that’s the – you start with that and then you develop the capability. So it’s going to be a team effort. But we have responsibilities, and we take them seriously, and we’re moving out.
To the second part of the question, you know, again, I think all of our discussions have come back to our ability to share data and to be able to do that at machine speed. When you talk of inhibitors, obviously there are different systems. There are different caveats on information in terms of security and access. And then there are different data standards. So I think right there you’ve got three key aspects. And they’re all things that we are getting after. And I know that from an AUKUS perspective, you know, the theory, of course, is that if we can share the secrets associated with nuclear-powered submarines, then everything else ought to be a little easier for us.
Dr. Edel: I’d like to go to the audience, but I’m just going to underscore something that someone had said to me recently about what is AUKUS? I mean, we were kind of kicking this idea around. They said, well, it strikes me that it’s at least two parts. It’s the very visible things that you see – like this, right? It’s the signal that we send of enhanced collaboration, the additive portions about this, what this means for all three countries. But it’s also the less visible parts that – not only the end part, the collaboration, but what new asymmetric edge capabilities are we not only thinking about, collaborating on, but bringing to the field quicker than we might otherwise have the ability to? Both the invisible and the visible parts that actually feed into that deterrence equation.
Let me turn to the audience here. See what questions you have. I’d like to ask our audience, both online but really for those of you in the room, to please identify yourself and also keep your question concise. Thank you. Hands up. Demetri, please wait for the microphone.
Q: Thank you. Demetri with the Financial Times.
Charlie, this is going seem like you read my mind, but we did not coordinate. In the context of a Taiwan contingency, if you had a magic wand for a day what are some things that you’re not thinking about right now in the armies that you should be thinking about? And are you facing any resistance from other services or parts of the joint force when you try to propose things that are not on the table at the moment?
Dr. Edel: General George, do you want to start with that question?
Gen. George: I will answer your second part first, Dimitri. I’m not sure I’m getting any, you know, pushback from anybody in the – across from my – from my joint teammates. I really haven’t – have not seen that. We’re exercising together out in the in the Pacific. I mean, we’re doing war games together. I’m good friends with all the other chiefs. And when we talk about this, I think that there is a clear recognition that it’s going to take everybody across the joint force with whatever we’re doing to be successful out there. So I haven’t.
And if I’m forgetting to think about something, you know, I forgot what it is. I don’t – we spend a lot of time actually trying to pour over this. I think, if anything, what we’re learning is that we’re – you know, again, we have to figure out – where I think our challenge is, is that we may observe something. It’s actually drilling it into our formation and actually making the change. It’s one thing to talk about a lesson that maybe you’ve seen from Ukraine. But if you don’t actually change, you know, what you’re buying, how you’re buying things, if you don’t actually change how you’re operating, and how you’re training and how you’re training your people, then you’re not – you’re not really preparing your formation. And so that’s – I think that’s our big – you know, that’s certainly my big focus.
Dr. Edel: Can I just shift that question a little bit? General Sanders, when you think about this, I mean, all the lessons that we’re pulling out of Ukraine, transformation of war, also a landlocked country. Does this apply when we’re thinking about, you know, contestant logistics, when we’re thinking about a maritime theater, when we’re thinking about a Taiwan contingency? Which things should we have front of mind for this?
Gen. Sanders: So, first of all, and I should clearly say to the Financial Times that any decision to be involved in a conflict in the Indo-Pacific will be a government one. So I’m going to put that out there. But so one of the things I think we have learnt from Ukraine, and I don’t know if this extends to the scenario you describe, is that at the start of a conflict you see actually a dislocation of domains. So, you know, mines and land-based coastal artillery, if you like, pushes maritime forces away from the land. You know, I’m not sure that you can draw all the right lessons from Ukraine, but certainly, you know, the air domain has not played a significant role. And ground-based air defense has kept the Russian air force, for the most part, at range.
And so you need to be able to think through how initially you can either unlock that problem or you are – you have got sufficient organic resilience and capability to be able to cope with that initial phase of dislocation of domains, because you may not be able to rely on the assumptions.
But in the same way that, you know, if you want to go fast, you go alone, you want to go far, you go together, the only way that we unlock some of these very, very complex operational challenges that we’re going to face is to do it, A, by integrating all the domains. I mean, I think that is our superpower as armed forces, that we do it arguably better than anyone else in the world; and secondly, to be able to do it with partners. And that comes down to what we’ve been banging on about, which is, you know, enabling the data sharing and the interoperability.
Dr. Edel: Final, kind of playing off of Dimitri’s question, noting that I’m changing the question as we go here, General Stuart, you’ve mentioned several times about the transformation towards – from a land-based towards a littoral force for the Army. Why the logic of that change? How does this apply to this specific region that we’re talking about? How does it make the Army more useful?
Lt. Gen. Stuart: Sure. Can I just directly answer the first part of your –
Dr. Edel: Or you can answer his question. That also works. (Laughter.)
Lt. Gen. Stuart: No, I’ll come back. But just to say that in the same way as our – the work we’re doing with allies and a growing number of partners has increased exponentially in just the last few years. The same applies internally. So with the other service and domain chiefs in the Australian context, we’re all rowing in the same direction. There’s, I think, better cooperation and genuine teamwork than there’s ever been. And I think our circumstances demand nothing less. And that’s certainly the approach that you would expect from military professionals.
To the point about why littoral maneuver, it’s physics and it’s geography and it is a response to how can we best optimize our Army, our land forces, to do their principal job, which is to win the battle on the land. But how can we be more useful? How do you leverage the versatility of land forces in ways that better support the multidomain and the combined fight?
So if you look at, as you’ve mentioned, the map, there’s a lot blue. But that blue extends inland as well. So how do we best take advantage of a much greater surface area, if you like, by leveraging the littoral – the land, the sea, the air above, and the EMS – for positional advantage so that we can apply effects from whichever domain is best placed to take advantage of the window of convergence to apply effect?
Dr. Edel: Let me see; go out to the audience for questions.
Sir, please wait for the microphone. It’s coming right your way.
Q: Hi. I’m going to stand up here. Hi. My name is Nishank. I’m with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Lovely to meet you all.
We’ve talked about asymmetric capabilities and the gray zones. So my question to each of you is what is your conception of the gray zone in the Indo-Pacific vis-à-vis China? And what is the role of land power, particularly in exploiting that gray zone?
I’m wondering if you could draw on any lessons from Afghanistan and Iraq, knowing, of course, that that’s – you know, we don’t really talk about that much anymore, looking at Ukraine specifically, but certainly China and other actors are looking at the performance and, of course, the end state in both Afghanistan and Iraq. So what, if any, are some of the lessons that can be drawn on from those conflicts to develop our understanding of the gray zone and perhaps how can we exploit it in the Indo-Pacific?
Thank you.
Dr. Edel: Great. Thank you for the really simple question. How do you define the gray-zone challenge? And what are we doing to go after it?
Let’s start actually right in the region. How do you think about this?
Lt. Gen. Stuart: Yeah. Sure. I actually don’t subscribe to the theory of a gray zone, other than to say that it – I think the term emerges from the gaps in our capabilities to respond to the challenges of the – of the 21st century. And that’s what we’ve been working for – you know, over the last sort of half decade, in the sort of post-Iraq/Afghanistan era, to understand. And to understand how we need to, firstly, modernize, then it was transform, and now adapt – and adapt means a continual process – to the changes in our operating environment. So I think gray zone sort of really is a term that describes a set of challenges that we didn’t really have good answers for. And so the areas that we’ve just been talking about, those areas of endeavor, and in particular being able to share data and information at machine speed, and in a – in an environment of trust is central to that.
To the question of, you know, what are some of the lessons that we’ve learned in places like Afghanistan, that we need to bring with us into the future, I think the integration of effects. But we need to do that exponentially quicker and at scale. But also the relationship between special operations and conventional operations I think needs to be a lot tighter. And, for example, we just completely transformed our special operations capability along functional lines – special warfare, strategic reconnaissance, technical enablement, and those kinds of functions – to best meet the demands of the – you know, of the theater, and of the support for that combined and multidomain fight.
Dr. Edel: See if we can gather maybe one or two more questions. Let me – oh, sorry, yes. Of course, General George.
Gen. George: Can I – one quick comment that I was going to add on – that we are working on for us. And I agree with Simon as far as understanding the environment. So we are – actually one of the things that we talked about over the last couple of days, as we have a multidomain taskforce, is actually doing that together. So, again, part of this, we’re looking at having a joint team. It’ll be out at the third and multidomain task force. And, again, I think that that’s what’s important, is understanding your environment. And that’s what that organization is out there, is built to do.
Dr. Edel: I’m going to go out, but – OK. Let me gather, actually, two questions at the time. That means you get to pick which question you actually want to answer. But let me go, sir, right here, and then we’ll go to the back, please. Sorry, right up here. Thank you.
Q: Thanks. Hi. Philip Reeker with the Albright Stonebridge Group of Dentons Global Advisors.
Generals, thank you all. We have a team sort of activated to try to help clients, companies to meet the needs and the opportunities of AUKUS. Just very briefly, I toss out there, what would your messages be to the private sector, that they should be doing, thinking about, and how they might be focusing to meet some of the needs you’ve described, and help our militaries in that sense?
Dr. Edel: Thank you. And then there’s a question right here. Go ahead. Microphone’s coming your way.
Q: Hi. Cate Cadell from The Washington Post.
I just wanted to ask about your perceptions of Beijing’s land forces, how they’re changing, and whether you think Ukraine has really impacted their thinking in terms of how they’re thinking regionally as well, you know, growing their partnerships in the region.
Dr. Edel: Great. Let me throw it back to the three of you. We have one question about how you’d like the private sector to be thinking about some of the opportunities that we’ve scoped here. And then, two, how is Beijing viewing this, particularly some of the transformations that we’ve been talking about here.
General George, you mind kicking off?
Gen. George: Yeah, well, so the big things that we’ve been talking about is unmanned systems and countering unmanned systems, I think some of the big challenges that we’re seeing, in how fast that that’s spinning and how quickly that we need to be able to react to that.
We talk a lot about the network and what we need to do to simplify our network, and a lot of that is the kind of commercial, off-the-shelf tech that I think is out there. And that’s an example of something that is – that is moving very rapidly, I think, a lot in the contested logistics that we can – you know, that we’re talking about – additive manufacturing, tele-maintenance, and all the things, again, that we’re learning.
And then, obviously, spend a lot of time on long-range fires.
So those are kind of the big areas that we are really focused on and I think we could bring things very quickly to AUKUS.
Dr. Edel: General Sanders?
Gen. Sanders: So, in the spirit of rugby, I’m going to leave the hospital pass on the Chinese army to my good friend Simon to pick – to pick up on. (Laughter.)
And just to acknowledge Philip, who is not only a great servant to the United States but a great friend to the U.K. as well. So it’s good to see you again.
I think I would – I would focus on responsibility. And what I mean by that is we know that some of the most important foundational technologies we’re going to be employing over the next few decades are in cyber, and particularly disinformation and misinformation, and then artificial intelligence. And because we are world-leading as nations in these spheres – and we are – the standards that we set, the approach that we take will kind of set the standard for the rest of the world as well. So responsible use of artificial intelligence and the ethical considerations would be sort of my – well, near the top of my list.
Dr. Edel: So you’ve – it’s been punted over to you – (laughter) – to think about the lessons that others might be drawing out of contemporary conflict, which may or may not be the same as the ones that we’re drawing.
Lt. Gen. Stuart: Sure. Look, let me answer your question by saying a few things.
The first is deterrence is ultimately decided in the mind of its objective. And our nations all seek to ensure that we live in a world – we call it the rules-based order; that is, there are road rules, and that we can all – all nations can live in a way that satisfies their national interest, their way of life, their quality of life, and not be dictated to. And that’s the world we have lived in, you know, for about the last 80 years. That’s worth preserving and that’s worth working together to preserve.
As I said at the outset, whole-of-nation in a combined effort and capability – or, collective capability, is at the heart of supporting collective will. And it’s our job as military professionals, as leaders of our respective armies, to ensure that we are doing our part to generate collective capability as part of that combined multidomain force to provide the governments and the communities that we serve with options to demonstrate collective capability that gives effect – gives expression to collective will.
It is not specifically directed at anyone. It is directed at everyone who might seek to challenge that global rules-based order.
Dr. Edel: I’d like to wrap here by thanking all three of you for coming here to have this conversation because this is I’d say an underappreciated, but it’s really an underdeveloped part of how we think about this domain. This is a conversation about not only this partnership, but about how these nations work together to generate, as you just said, collective capacity, collective capabilities.
And one thing that really struck me in our conversation is if it hasn’t hit you in the face already, the fact that we’re moving into a new and much more contested environment, it’s very clear that the risks that we are assuming are greater. And so the risks that we need to take from how we do business as usual, to potentially what our budgets look like, to the amount of friction we’re willing to stand as we push back against coercive attempts to undermine this rules-based order is growing.
So I’d like to thank you very much for coming out for this very public conversation that is the start of a conversation about where we go next. Thank you all very much. (Applause.)

58,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/amos-yadlin-new-type-israeli-war,Unknown,"March 5, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS podcast published on March 5, 2024. Listen to the podcast here.
Jon Alterman: Amos Yadlin is the founder and current president of MIND Israel, an Israeli national security consultancy. He previously served for a decade as the director of the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, following a 40-year career in the Israeli defense forces, including as the head of the Military Intelligence Directorate and as defense attaché to the United States. He proudly says that he's the only human being to have participated directly in the elimination of two nuclear weapons programs.
Amos Yadlin, welcome to Babel.
Amos Yadlin: It's a pleasure, Jon.
Jon Alterman: You have fought in a number of Israel's wars. How is the Gaza war different from other wars Israel's fought?
Amos Yadlin: Yes. This war is different in two aspects. First, for the first time since the independence war, we are fighting a multi-theater war basically against seven entities and nations, including Gaza, Lebanon, and Hezbollah. Missiles are being fired at us from Syria, Iraq, and Yemen, while the West Bank is sending terror. Iran is behind all of this.
It's a multifront war that we haven't seen since '48. We haven't seen more than one front since the Yom Kippur War 50 years ago.
Second, it is a long war. Israeli defense is saying, ""We need a strong deterrence. If deterrence fails, we need an early warning to call the reserve and to be ready for a war. We need a good defense and a decisive victory in a short war."" Since we are reliant on mobilizing the reserve, the economy is paralyzed.
In this case, it's a long war. We had long wars, like the second Intifada, but this was carried out by the regular military. Now, we have mobilized 300,000 reserves to form an air defense against seven entities. So once again, a long war goes against Israel’s defense doctrine.
Gaza is also unique. We are fighting in an urban area. The United States fought in an urban area, but it was never prepared for 15 years of war with a lot of underground facilities, tunnels, holes, and production centers. Gaza’s underground military is a huge challenge that I don't remember any military dealing with.
Last but not least, we came to this war from a political crisis. We came to the war when Israel was split into two camps. A prime minister who has tried to carry out a judicial revolution and a very strong camp against it. We entered the war when half of the people had very low trust in the Israeli judiciary, in the prime minister.
Jon Alterman: It also feels to me like there are members of the ruling coalition who have some pretty hardline views on a number of things, especially Palestinian self-determination, the right of Palestinians even to live within the boundaries of mandatory Palestine. How does that shape what a settlement might look like, when on the one hand you have deep divisions in Israel, but you also have people who are in the government whose views are rather extreme by likes of traditional Israeli policy?
Amos Yadlin: We have to differentiate between two issues. One is the fact that the prime minister depends on this very minority of extreme right-wingers that you mentioned. He depends on them for his political survival - he has no government without them.
It is not so much affecting the war, but it's affecting how to get out of the war, what you call a settlement of the conflict. On the other hand, it is very important to know that the two-state solution today in Israel has no support in any quarter.
What Hamas has done on the 7th of October proved to the Israelis their nightmares - that the Palestinians want to kill them, to destroy them. We are dealing not with a nation that you can do business with; you are dealing with a jihadist organization that's supported by the people. So, the idea of having a Palestinian state controlled by Hamas is unacceptable to any Israeli, even in the center and the left.
Jon Alterman: Do you think Israelis have the right concept of victory as they look at this war? As you look forward, do you think that people have properly calibrated what a successful outcome will be?
Amos Yadlin: We have to forget about a decisive victory as we knew it. We must forget about the unconditional surrendering that Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin defined vis-a-vis Nazi Germany or the unconditional surrender of Japan in 1945.
Look at the United States. Where have you won a war? In Vietnam? In Iraq? In Afghanistan? This is a different kind of war. The only problem for us is that we cannot declare victory and leave. We are living here. You can leave Afghanistan, and you haven't won, but life in New York and D.C. are the same. Same thing with Vietnam and Iraq.
For us, it's different. The government put two goals to the war, which are very ambitious: to dismantle Hamas and to bring back the hostages. We are halfway through meeting these goals. From the very beginning, I personally said that the goal of dismantling Hamas is a yearlong goal. This cannot be done in six days or six weeks.
I asked my friend General John Allen, ""How long did it take for the Americans and their 84-country coalition to destroy ISIS in Mosul?"" The answer is nine months. Mosul is much easier than Gaza. Nobody supports ISIS. Hamas is supported by Iran, Qatar, and Turkey. They had 15 years to prepare themselves for the war. So, if it took nine months for the American-led coalition. The IDF is dealing with something which is 10 times more difficult.
The problem is with the second goal of bringing back the hostages. Here, the clocks are not synchronized. If dismantling Hamas will take a year, the hostages are running out of time. They are starving as we speak. They may die from their wounds. The females are raped. The need to bring them back home should be number one. The second goal of dismantling Hamas can be done later.
Jon Alterman: How do you think about the increasing practice of taking hostages? Is that something you think we're going to start seeing in future wars? Do you think Israelis are especially sensitive to hostage-taking?
Amos Yadlin: The idea that every human being in Israel is your brother or son and you have to do everything to bring him back, has been a moral guidance for us for many, many years. After the governments of Peres and Shamir, we saw Israeli soldiers being released in exchange for terrorists. In 1985, Rabin released thousands of terrorists for eight Israeli soldiers who were prisoners of war. Netanyahu released 1,000 terrorists, including Sinwar, for one Israeli soldier. I think by now, Israel has understood that these numbers are unacceptable. In a way, it's encouraged kidnapping and taking hostages. I think the United States just released $6 billion for a couple of hostages in Tehran, so it's a problem for every democratic country that deals with a terror or a rogue state.
Jon Alterman: You mentioned your conversation with John Allen, and when I've spoken to retired U.S. generals in the last several months, many feel that they've been spending several decades fighting insurgencies in the Middle East. They seem exasperated that few Israeli decision-makers think that their observations, especially about the importance of targeting the views of noncombatants, are relevant to the Israeli situation. The American approach to counterinsurgency says that you have to divide the combatants from the people who support them and show people that there is a better way than supporting the combatants. It also says that you have to care for the civilian population. Is that just not applicable in your view in Gaza? Do you feel that the civilian casualties are unfortunate but necessary for the military task?
Amos Yadlin: First, let's deal with the second part of your question. Israel is fighting according to international law. We try not to target any civilians. However, we don't let Hamas use the civilians as a human shield. We already know by now that Hamas always places command posts under hospitals, UN posts, schools, camps, and so on, and so forth. That's why in the first weeks, we asked the population to leave Gaza. To leave anything that is associated with Hamas.
Some people did stay, whether because of their connection to Hamas or because Hamas forced them to stay. We haven't targeted the hospitals, but we went into the hospitals. Nobody was killed in the hospitals, only Hamas. So, we feel that we are fighting according to international law, and the blame is on Sinwar who started the war. On Sinwar, who adopted a doctrine of human shielding and is holding the hostages. The whole blame is on him. We feel that anybody who has complaints should contact Hamas leadership.
Jon Alterman: When President Biden says that the Israeli reaction is over the top, is he misinformed in your view?
Amos Yadlin: Absolutely. Absolutely. I'm referencing the U.S. way of doing business. Why did you go to Iraq and Afghanistan? Go to Japan and Germany? I don't remember that you differentiated between the innocent people in Dresden. I don't remember that you did it when you attacked Tokyo in 1945 with firebombs. Unlike what your generals are telling us, it hasn't pushed the Germans or the Japanese to be more extreme. On the contrary, they've become democratic. They've become peace lovers. The idea that you failed in Iraq and Afghanistan is not something that we have to take as guidance to our activity.
I met some of your generals when they came here before we entered Gaza. Their prediction was that Gaza was impossible. That we will have thousands of casualties. Yes, Gaza was very difficult. But due to the heavy bombardment of areas that should have been empty of any civilians; due to advanced weapons and advanced protection, what has been done in Gaza is a unique military achievement that nobody thought could be achieved on your side of the military from the generals. They are surprised.
Jon Alterman: You talked about the post-conflict environment in Japan and Germany. How do you get there with the Palestinians? Is there a strategy to create a post-conflict peace? Israelis are deeply traumatized. Gazans are deeply traumatized. I'm not sure how we get beyond the trauma of a post-conflict political environment.
Amos Yadlin: Yeah. I have an idea. I'm running this small consultancy firm called MIND Israel. After multiple months, MIND Israel came up with a way forward for “the day after.” We said first, you have to dismantle Hamas. As long as you leave Hamas there, nothing will happen. It will be a combination of Somalia and Afghanistan. You need to finish the job to dismantle Hamas.
Then, you should bring a Palestinian bureaucracy that can take over Gaza and rebuild it. It cannot be done by the current PA, which is corrupt, weak, unable to control Jenin and Tulkarm in the West Bank, and which is not legitimate in the view of their own people because there were no elections there for many years.
A revised PA - and here I am, using the same terminology that the Biden administration is using - which is mentored by an Arab consortium of Egyptians, Saudis, and the UAE, is the way to start and rebuild a demilitarized and deradicalized Palestinian state. Otherwise, the war will continue, and the conflict will continue.
I am a veteran of the Yom Kippur War, which was a very tough and bloody war. But five years later, President Sadat came to Israel. He said, ""No more war. No more bloodshed."" And since then, we have not been fighting with the Egyptians, which is now our strongest and largest neighbor.
Jon Alterman: You've thought long and hard about this, and I'm sure you have a reaction to the argument that some people make; that you can't destroy an idea and Hamas is an idea. You can dismantle the organization, but you have to provide an alternative idea for people to embrace. Or, it has to be an alternative idea for people to embrace, and Hamas cannot be wiped out. Does that ring true to you? Or do you think there's something fundamentally mistaken about it?
Amos Yadlin: At this moment, we are not trying to destroy the idea. We cannot destroy an idea. We have to destroy their capabilities to do it again. So, it's not what they think. It's not their heart and mind, it's their capability.
We are not going to change the heart and the mind, but their capability will be destroyed. But let me ask you another question. Have you destroyed the Nazi thinking? You need to achieve it by unconditional victory, which we are far from because we are not alone with Gaza. The whole world is now trying to stop us. So, it will not be unconditional surrender. Then, we will not be able to have a different culture in the Gaza Strip.
Jon Alterman: That's exactly what Hamas is trying to do, they're trying to isolate Israel in the world. I think you would agree that they've been successful in large parts of the world. Does that matter for Israel? What do you think, if anything, Israel should be doing to try to mitigate this isolation, both around the world but also in the United States where it's becoming a more polarizing issue?
Amos Yadlin: It was polarizing before. As Israelis, we want to live first and to be popular second. Of course, if you can live well and have good relations with everybody, fine. But if you have to choose whether this country will be safe and not so popular or popular and not safe, it is not a tough decision.
After all, 82 percent of Americans prefer the Israeli narrative and not the Hamas narrative. We shouldn’t imply too much from college campuses. I've been there. I teach a class there. The people were against Israel and demonstrated against me before this war. They want Palestine from the river to the sea, which means genocide to Israel. They don't always know which river and which sea, but they are exposed to all the propaganda. At the end, despite the fake news and the propaganda, I think any decent human being in the world will understand that Israel is the better side in this conflict.
Jon Alterman: As somebody who was the defense attaché to Washington, are you concerned with rising criticism of Israel in the Democratic Party, in the sense that Israel is becoming a more partisan issue than it has been for a half-century since Israel initially started as a Democratic issue?
Amos Yadlin: You are absolutely right that Israel was a bipartisan issue in America. The fact that it is not anymore is not because of this war. It started 20 or 15 years ago. For as long as “Bibi” was the prime minister, it's become even worse because Netanyahu basically sided with the Republicans, so the Democrats were against us.
Let me tell you something that I believe in the end will work. Bernard Shaw used to say, ""If you are at the age of 20 and you are not a communist, you have no heart. If at the age of 40, you are still a communist, you have no brain."" When these 20-year-old people grow up a little bit, they will understand who is right and who is wrong.
I still think most Americans support Israel, but some of them support the Palestinians. If they enjoy supporting murderers, those who want to destroy the Jewish people, fine with them.
Jon Alterman: So let me ask you a question about truth to close things out. Israelis are relentlessly blunt and confront hard facts. There will be an effort to understand what went wrong and to promote accountability. When do you think that is going to really get some traction? How is it likely to unfold? What kinds of consequences might we anticipate from it?
Amos Yadlin: Very good question. It is important to learn from the mistakes that have been done. But there are three different processes to it. One process is called briefing, professional briefing. The goal of this professional briefing is to understand what went wrong and to correct it for next time, to have the lessons learned, and to implement.
The second is an inquiry committee. This committee, which, according to the law in Israel, is done by the Supreme Court, has to find who to blame and who is responsible. They are looking for the blame, not for the lesson learned. The last one is the people's verdict. You go to an election.
So, the first process will start if there is a ceasefire for hostages there. The IDF will start the process of debriefing because this is important. The IDF will do it professionally as we did it after '73, after the Second Lebanese War. I'm very confident that this learning process will make us better.
Jon Alterman: Is that a sort of a three-month or 12-month process? I mean, give me a sense for how long it might take.
Amos Yadlin: Yeah, it's a three-month process. The committee nominated by the Supreme Court has to be nominated after a government decision. I'm afraid that Netanyahu will try to postpone it as much as possible. Unlike after '73, when the process was a couple of months, Israel is now giving the people who may be found guilty the possibility to call lawyers and have testimonies. This will make the process very long. It's very long. So, the election may clear the system even earlier than the inquiry committee. I'm not an expert of politics, but my instincts are that it will be in the coming year.
Jon Alterman: Do you think that the Israeli inquiry that follows will be somewhat like the 9/11 Commission Report or very different? How would you think about that in terms of output?
Amos Yadlin: 9/11 was mostly an intelligence failure. It was not an operational failure; it was not a political failure. The 7th of October has three layers of failures. Unfortunately, all of them align to create a catastrophe on the 7th of October.
It's an intelligence failure that didn’t give the early warning about what Hamas was going to do. It’s the operational failure that the Southern Command was not ready. There is the political level of encouraging Hamas, giving Hamas the Qatari money, and basically leading Israel into a domestic crisis that gave our enemies the idea that this is the right time to attack Israel.
So, there are three levels. All of them need to be looked at by this committee. I hope it will be with people of prestige such as professional judges and people from military, intelligence, or political backgrounds that will deal with the three levels of failures that we, unfortunately, had on the 7th of October.
Jon Alterman: Amos Yadlin, thank you very much for joining us on Babel.
Amos Yadlin: My pleasure, Jon.

59,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/data-nato-responsibility-sharing,Unknown,"February 21, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS event hosted on February 21, 2024. Watch the full video here.
Vago Muradian: Welcome to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, that’s just released a fascinating report, “Pulling their Weight: The Data on NATO Responsibility Sharing,” that tries to bring some intellectual rigor to the increasingly rancorous debate about alliance burden sharing and the staggering costs of rebuilding atrophied but expensive capabilities as the Western alliance tries to better stand up to Russia, support Ukraine, and also play a role in helping deter China.
I’m Vago Muradian, editor of the Defense and Aerospace Report, and it’s my honor to moderate this conversation today with two of the august authors of this fascinating paper, to get – as I said, to bring some rigor to the discussion. Dr. Kathleen McInnis is the director of the Smart Women, Smart Power Initiative here at CSIS, and also one of the big NATO brains. Kathleen, welcome. And Dan Fata, who is a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Europe and NATO during the Bush administration, who has also had a long career in industry and advisory. Two of your group, Dr. Ben Jensen, who is from Marine Corps University, and Jose Macias were unfortunately unable to attend today.
What I find fascinating about this discussion is burden sharing, you know, squabbles go back to the earliest days of the alliance. Harry Truman was complaining about Europeans that aren’t spending enough money. This was consistent throughout the Cold War. And indeed, past administrations of both parties have complained. George W. Bush’s administration was complaining even as allies and partners were helping in Afghanistan and Iraq. Barack Obama was complaining. And then most pronouncedly – though the tone of this discussion did change during the Trump administration, where we found a lot more rancor that was directed to our allies and partners.
And now, as a presidential candidate, Donald Trump is saying that there should be some form of litmus test, something that was introduced at that point if you’re not paying enough. And for those who don’t “pay their dues,” as he’s put it, which is a misleading statement, that allies – that he would welcome Russian attacks on those guys who don’t spend enough. Then there were a lot of discussions about what constitutes, you know, the actual 2 percent goal, which was a 2014 thing, as some people will remember, at Newport. And we needed to say something, and the answer was let’s all commit to 2 percent, with 20 percent for investment.
Kathleen, allies and partners are spending more money. There’s a little bit of debate about whether infrastructure spending should be part of that. And we’ll discuss that in a minute. From your standpoint, where are our allies in terms of what they’re spending? And what do critics get wrong about this entire burden sharing debate, which, as you said, is a better bar discussion among academics than with the American public?
Kathleen McInnis: (Laughs.) Well, so I’m going to start with the second part of the question first, right? What are we getting wrong about the burden sharing debate? And I think, critically, one of the common misperceptions about NATO burden sharing is that it’s somehow a payment to the United States for protection, like a protection money scheme kind of thing.
Mr. Muradian: Afghanistan as well, and many other operations all around the world.
Dr. McInnis: Absolutely, 100 percent. So and the other piece of this that is kind of strategically weird is that we’re so focused on 2 percent. And it is true, if you don’t invest you’re not going to have outputs, the kinds of capabilities you need on defense. This is true. However, our publics when they think about what the need is, it’s necessarily only military and defense capabilities. Our publics want safety and security. And you need safety and security for not only public expectations, but also when you think about things like deterrence. You need a resilient infrastructure, to be able to deter Russia. You need a broader suite of national security capabilities. So that led us to writing this report. OK, if we need this broader set of capabilities – I mean, we’ve been focusing on 2 percent. What are allies actually spending on the broader stuff? Now, it’s really hard to put this data together, for a variety of reasons. But if I could pull up graph number one.
Mr. Muradian: It’s terrific that we’re going to have show and tell, but to your point it’s beyond – it’s beyond the dollars that are being spent, especially when the United States is now fueling uncertainty among allies and partners, right? That’s not a good way of going about this either, right, to have an explorative kind of approach.
Dr. McInnis: Right. How do we – how do we build the kinds of strategic relationships necessary, or maintain the kinds of relationships necessary, to deter China if we have that transactional approach to our alliances? So anyway, so we decided, actually, let’s start looking at the data and seeing what allies are actually spending on the broader set of national security capabilities? To include things like pivoting away from Russian energy sources. And it was a very interesting discussion. Again, this is from 2022 because that’s the latest set of data that we could get for public order and safety. And I think future iterations of this study will be getting to more and more granularity. There’s some things that aren’t captured in this.
But first, rough order of magnitude swag. This is what the different nations have been spending on the broader suite of national security capabilities. So defense spending, public order and safety, assistance to Ukraine, and then this energy pivoting. And we see things like Lithuania spent almost 8 percent of its GDP on what we would call national security in 2022. So let’s go to the next chart, chart number two. And so anybody who worked NATO ISAF operations – (laughter) – there was this thing at the end –
Mr. Muradian: I want to call foul on that. You don’t point to somebody and laugh about that. (Laughter.)
Dr. McInnis: So yeah, we – Dan and I worked on it together. There was this thing called the ISAF placemat that was published every month. And it sort of showed which allies had which number troops where in Afghanistan. And so we decided to actually start, you know, taking that – the data from the first graph and map it onto a placemat and really see where we are. And dark green on here is those allies that are spending more than 4 percent of their GDP on what we would call national security spending. The lighter green is between 3 and 4 percent. And then orange is between 2 and 3 percent. Blue is Iceland, because they don’t have a defense – they’ve got a civil defense force, but not a military. And then the purple is we just couldn’t capture the data for Montenegro and North Macedonia. But we wanted to start get this picture out to show –
Mr. Muradian: Well, I’d invite Russia to attack both of those at this point. No, I’m just kidding.
Dr. McInnis: No. (Laughs.) Bad idea. Bad idea. Yeah. So what we see is actually if we’re – if it’s all about, you know, 2 percent of GDP and what our country is actually spending, it’s actually a fairly optimistic picture that’s not captured in the public debate, and that we wanted to start showing. And, again, I see this study – this is the first cut at something. What’s not what’s not reflected in here is things like cybersecurity infrastructure spending, dual use rail gages, public-private partnerships for deterrence purposes, those kinds of things. And we’d like to get into more detail next time. But as we’re getting into summit season and thinking about these kinds of burden-sharing, responsibility-sharing – we call it responsibility sharing – this is the initial cut. And it’s not as bad as you think.
Daniel Fata: Can I just add on to this? I think multiple things were important here. One is we need to get away from this term burden sharing to responsibility sharing. Because not everybody can share the burdens equally. You know, you look at your Luxembourgs and others, they don’t have enough absorptive capacity at 2 percent to be able to fully share the burdens. But they can be doing other things. So there needs to be flexibility in how we think about this. And also, in nothing that we describe here do we reduce or take away from needing to meet the NATO minimum of 2 percent on defense.
When Kathleen first showed me this – and great job to Ben and Jose for all the work that they did as part of the Futures Lab here – what struck me was three things. One, it provides a more complete picture of what’s being done by the individual allies. And you can get a more collective snapshot. Second, it really does push back. Look at these numbers here. It does push back on the narrative that NATO allies aren’t doing enough. And, third, by understanding where the monies are being spent per country, it gives us the ability to figure out where there are still gaps, and what can be emulated in other countries. And so I think that’s important.
My final point here is this whole 2 percent debate, look, guilty as charged. I was part of it under Secretaries Rumsfeld and Gates. And it starts with when the new allies came in as part of their agreement they had to spend 2 percent, and they rapidly stopped meeting 2 percent once they got in the alliance. So that generated something. Then you have Afghanistan. And, again, I wrote the speeches and the talking points for Gates and Rumsfeld that you guys need to be spending more, you have too many caveats in Afghanistan.
It would only be sort of after I left the Pentagon and continued to stay in touch with Secretary Gates that I said to him at one point – I said, you know, sir, it finally dawned on me why the caveats were there. And it’s not that those allies didn’t want to participate in certain parts of the mission. It’s they had underinvested for so long that they were actually dangerous to the mission. And so you would see this build up in ’09 and ’10 of better forces going to Afghanistan and more money being spent, which would, ultimately, I think, lay the platform for ’14. How do we keep that going?
Mr. Muradian: Let me ask you about that under-structure investment, right? We found in 2014 we didn’t have the rail lines that were able to carry heavy cargo, for example, like armored vehicles. We didn’t have the rail stock. There were no induction ports anymore, as we used to have in Denmark and elsewhere across the alliance. And so all of our allies and partners have been focusing on that back-shop capability that is foundational to the alliance. How do you need to change the discussion?
Because when you would talk to senior Trump officials, they would say, well, that doesn’t constitute defense spending, right? What we’re looking for is 2 percent. And an underlying message, which was sort of revealed when I was on a trip to Denmark, actually, was, well, not only do you have to spend 2 percent, you have to buy weapons from us. And then it’s up to us whether or not we do come to your defense at that point, for a variety of other unclear factors. Which kind of went over a little bit like a lead balloon among senior officials at the time.
From your standpoint, as somebody who’s been engaging in this debate for a long time as well as a policymaker who was bringing out the brass knuckles and beating them up, how does the nature of this discussion have to change to take that? Because there’s this sense that if you look at it from an integrated perspective, you’re somehow backsliding, right? You’re giving them out. Which isn’t really the case.
Mr. Fata: No, it’s not that the case. And, you know, Kathleen and I were joking about this. There’s going to be plenty of people that after this session ends will be saying, well, you calculated wrong, or you did this wrong, or you did that wrong. In many ways, that’s not the audience we’re trying to appeal to. We’re trying to appeal to your parliamentarians, your lawmakers, your administration officials on both sides, as to needing to understand that building and investing in resiliency – ports, rails, cyber, airports, electric grids, alternative fuels – that’s all part of what was established in 1949 under the Washington Treaty.
Most folks who know anything about NATO focus on Article Five, attack on one is attack on all. Most folks don’t pay attention to Article Three, which is you have to be prepared. And so for a long time we collectively – and so it’s all members of the alliance – have only focused on the 2 percent, the hard stuff. But there is a requirement from the beginning. You have to have resiliency. You have to have the infrastructure to be able to support either allies coming to your defense or the ability for you to be able to hold off an attack. And so what existed in 1949, I would argue, still exists more now. There’s a lot of dynamism.
As a friend told me as I drove in here, he said, Dan, you know, the world is ruthless and you need allies in a ruthless world. And I think partly what we just need to be saying to our fellow American lawmakers, and colleagues, and others is, look, we need allies. NATO stands for No Alternative Treaty Organization. There is nothing else like there out that. And the more we beat up on them or say they’re not pulling the weight – their weight, the more we risk losing this. Kathleen mentioned the 75th anniversary of NATO coming up. I would love for us to think about what NATO at 100 looks like. And how do you keep this? At the end of the day, NATO is only useful if it’s agile, credible, and usable. It has to have all that stuff. In order to have that, you need the military side, but you need the resilient, the infrastructure, and everything that goes along with it.
My last point. Look at Pearl Harbor today. Nineteen potential berths. You can – only four are usable on only one is a munitions load out. I mean, we have our own problems. We can be beating up on our allies all the time, but we have our own problems that we have to address too.
Mr. Muradian: Well, we’ve under invested, right? Go back and ask every INDOPACOM commander, that’s one of their priorities. And it always slides down on the list because we find a whole bunch of other things to spend money on. I find it interesting that the only time – Article Five was designed for the United States to come to NATO’s assistance. And the only time it was invoked was after 9/11, when Europe came to our assistance. And one of the points our allies and partners would make is we consumed a generation-plus of modernization in order to be able to support you in both of these endeavors that consumed vast amounts of resources.
I’m going to give you a chance to weigh in, and then ask you what has become, to me, I think, a sort of a pseudo-intellectual discussion about the alliance. But go ahead, if you have any point you wanted to make.
Dr. McInnis: Oh, no, I was just going to build on what Dan was saying about, you know, we need the alliance to be credible, right? And credibility is not just military capability. It’s also political cohesion. And going back to what – the point you were raising of whether or not this dilutes the focus if you – if you open the aperture. And that’s one of the reasons that we haven’t been willing to open up the box of what’s being spent, the NATO planning, that black box.
Look, we are at great risk now of cutting off our nose to spite our face. The alliance is – by focusing on 2 percent, by making alliance participation a transactional discussion about euros and dollars, we are at risk of just completely losing this this thing that has mattered so much to U.S. strategic interests and global security more broadly. The discussion has become a political poison pill. We have to start getting ourselves away from this if we are going to see NATO at 100.
Mr. Muradian: But how do we do that, all right? As somebody who’s followed this debate for a long time, it has gotten particularly toxic since 2015. And for the first time the former president made statements that senior members of his party did not countermand immediately, which suggests a sea change. And so it means that whatever the position of the party was is something that is now in flux. Your party, as Republicans, would have been internationalist, focused on allies and partners.
I mean, we’re increasingly – is the pseudo-intellectual debate – is, well, you know, it’s time that we pull the plug on Ukraine. You know, it’s not about Russia. Everything is about China. We have to really focus on China. We’re doing everybody a favor by cutting off and moving on. And, you know, Ukraine really doesn’t fall into any category. Whereas I’m one of the people, and I think everybody – many people would agree, there is a connection to supporting Ukraine and better deterring China, for example.
Dr. McInnis: I mean, the Taiwanese, for example.
Mr. Muradian: For example. What’s sort of the bigger global way of looking at this on why this support is necessary, but more important – and, Dan, maybe you can start us off, how do you appeal to those who don’t want to help Ukraine, and now are increasingly saying, well, you know, to help – we’re going to free resources to spend on China. Which, you know, I mean, there’s that tendency in the department anyway, right? It’s like, we need to be focused. How do you – how do you do this? How do you argue this? And I want to get your take also on this.
Mr. Fata: Yeah. I mean, it’s been nothing but disappointing to watch this debate about whether NATO is worth investing in, whether we’re going to be there for them. I would probably take exception to something you said, where Trump came out, some parties – some members of the party delayed. But it appears to be – and I’m paraphrasing – it appears to be just accepted now. I don’t believe it’s accepted. And I believe, unfortunately, that it’s just the louder voices are being the ones that are heard, and the ones the media are covering, and not your average House member, or your average senator – or even your just average citizen. I don’t believe that they think NATO isn’t worth investing.
Now, the Europeans are deathly afraid. I still go to Europe. I have friends that are over there that I talk to all the time. And they’re afraid that the United States, whether it’s Republican or Democrat, is no longer predictable and no longer will potentially be there. They’ve got – obviously, they were bothered by President Trump’s remarks during his first – during his presidential term. What happened with the Afghanistan withdrawal, and not being notified. That sort of put the Europeans back on their heels like, hmm, maybe we do need to have some kind of strategic autonomy to be able to act if the U.S. isn’t going to be there.
Dr. McInnis: Oh, just, you know, the argument that if we – when we invest in Ukraine that we’re taking away our focus or diluting our focus on China. I would just offer that we are in an actual – there’s an actual shooting war happening in Ukraine right now. And so the – yes, we have to be able to pay attention to the long game. But there is a close fight that’s happening right now that threatens to expand to NATO countries if the line is not held in Ukraine. In that circumstance, we are likely in an enormous world of strategic hurt. Let’s play this out a little bit, right?
Just think about the Black Sea Grain Initiative, and the – when the war was kicked up a notch, shall we say, in 2022, how Ukrainian grain shortages sent ripple effects across the global economy. Europe is one of America’s largest trading partners. What kinds of economic shock waves are going to be sent if Russia does decide to take a bite at the NATO apple? He’s said since 2007 that that’s what he’s intending to do.
Mr. Muradian: He told us he was going to attack Ukraine, and we didn’t really listen to him either, twice.
Dr. McInnis: Right? So, I mean, he’s already articulated the playbook. He’s already articulated what he plans to do. Can you imagine the cost of the American taxpayer of that kind of global economic shock? It is not just in our normative moral, feel-good interest to be supporting NATO and to be holding the line with Ukraine. It’s actually in our no-kidding, pocketbook, financial interest. And if American voters are exposed to the kinds of economic shocks that we would likely see if we withdraw from NATO, I mean, I would imagine the political leadership will have hell to pay.
Mr. Muradian: And are you one of the people who, as a strategist, you’re sending the wrong signals to the Chinese, and the Chinese end up miscalculating over Taiwan, for example, in the wake of that?
Dr. McInnis: Yes.
Mr. Fata: Yes. (Laughter.)
Mr. Muradian: And that’s – no, I’m kidding.
Mr. Fata: And I’ll tell you one other thing. So absent the former president bashing NATO like this, I’m not sure the rest of those that either are part of the echo chamber or that have their grievances would be as vocal and would be as threatening as to say that we may withdraw from NATO. There’s always been the group that says, is Europe pulling their own weight? And what we’re trying to show is that they are being responsible. Are they doing exactly the way we would like that? No. But we also got to understand their uniqueness.
I also believe that at the end of the day the former president, he likes to raise issues where he picks up that there’s a grievance – a grievance amongst the public, a grievance amongst either members of Congress. And so because he finds issues that resonate. I don’t believe the former president will withdraw us from NATO if he is to be reelected. I don’t – I think that would be, to use Kathleen’s term, such a strategic shock that I don’t think – I don’t think he would – he and his team would want that.
That doesn’t mean though that they – and I fully anticipate something like this happening, like we did with South Korea and Japan in asking for base renegotiations and things, I think he’s going to want to potentially threaten to withdrawal unless something happens in return. And that may just be a better cost sharing of things or maybe we get NATO allies to agree to 2.25 percent, or something. But I believe he’s doing it for the purpose of trying to show that if I’m reelected, I will change things.
Mr. Muradian: But don’t you, I mean, the president of the United States also has a lot of powers in an alliance context, right, that go well beyond withdrawing, right? And I know there’s legislation and law on the books, actually, that U.S. monies cannot be used to do that. But he can reduce troop presence in Europe rather dramatically. Article Five, everybody has to vote on Article Five. You have to do something. You don’t have to necessarily provide troops, right? So you could decide to demure from the troop part of it, but I’ll give you intelligence support, or what have you. You have to do something in some capacity, but it doesn’t say exactly what you have to do, right?
So from that standpoint, can’t you actually – and in the last administration you had Jim Mattis and Mark Esper who slow rolled withdrawal of troops from Europe purposefully, you know, to buy time. Presumably the next time there will be no Mattis or Esper who say, OK, this is a really a bad idea. I mean, can you end up doing a lot of damage, irrespective of pulling out of NATO?
Dr. McInnis: Sure. Sorry, I was sort of thinking about the civilian-military relations dynamics of that, and just how problematic that situation was from a civ-mil perspective. Sure, the damage is being done right now, right? Again, credibility is a political determination as much as military capability. And so the fact that we’re having these discussions about whether or not the United States will be there in this kind of way suggests that if we want to keep the alliance we need to have a significant course correction to the discussion that’s taking place right now. This is one way of doing it. It’s not the only way.
But we – those individuals – those observers who agree with the argument that NATO has enduring strategic utility for the United States need to start making the case much more powerfully, and finding the ways to show the case, and show that the picture is not as grim as it has been painted out to be for decades. And oh, by the way, we need our allies. Everything’s better with friends, right? You can get more done. There’s so many global strategic challenges that you need allies and partners to contend with. And absent NATO, things become much harder. Those who agree with that set of arguments need to start making the case.
Mr. Muradian: Does Congress, when they were returning from recess, we took two bites of this. One was an insistence that we need a border deal in order to clear this. It was an unprecedented border deal, looking at it through the history of border deals in the United States on a bipartisan basis. Would have really moved the ball forward in a direction that one party actually might have liked less than the other party would have liked in terms of some foundational tenets. It was vetoed. Then a clean $95 billion package was approved by the Senate. The House did not take it up, has gone on recess.
When we get back, Dan and Kathleen, do lawmakers – I mean, does this emotional argument work? This aid package should have been approved four or five months ago because Ukraine is now paying the price. And as we prepare to convene for the 75th anniversary of the alliance’s birthday, on the way to 100, it’s not going to be a positive scene to be greeted literally every other day with another Avdiivka-style retreat or route. Does this move the needle at all, especially since the speaker was meeting with the former president and sort of mirroring a lot of the rhetoric?
Mr. Fata: Yeah, look, I think, unfortunately, because of the Navalny death –
Mr. Muradian: Assassination, let’s put it, killing at the least.
Mr. Fata: At the least, yeah. Tragic. Navalny’s – I mean, some of the Putin just actions and comments, what’s happening on the ground in Ukraine, the former – our former president’s comments, I think that has – my sense, and in talking with folks, it’s motivated the non-extreme parts of both parties to get this done, on the 95 billion (dollars) on Ukraine, Taiwan, and Israel. So I actually do have a pretty good sense of optimism that maybe not before the end of – end of February, but probably sometime before the middle of March, that I think we’re going to see something actually get passed to provide support.
I think there’s a growing sense that we can’t let – we can’t walk away from Ukraine. I think we have to help Ukraine. If we can’t help them win – which we should be helping them win. Not get to a tie. We should be helping Ukraine win. So I think there also needs to be a change in that strategy. But we at least have got to help Ukraine get into the best battlefield position for whatever an ultimate settlement or agreement will be.
Mr. Muradian: And, of course, the assassination of the Russian defector in Spain, right? I mean, I find the impunity with which Putin is acting, right? I mean, you kill Navalny right before Munich gathers, and then at the end of it you kill a Russian defector. It’s a nice way to bookend things. Your sense on whether or not it’s going to pass? And then I’ve got one more question for you.
Dr. McInnis: My analysis comports with Dan’s on Hill dynamics. I would just also underscore, that strategic sense that there’s no resetting with Russia now, right? We are in a new world. And it is – it is truly this competition between democracies and authoritarian actors. And Russia trying to rewrite the rules through military force, China seeming to try to do so through different versions of coercion. Ultimately, they’re different playbooks but with the same goal. And we have to start fighting back in all – in a whole-of-government, you know, of which military is one part, kind of way if we are going to prevail in this.
Like, when you think about what’s at stake. I mean, all these things are such abstractions. Like rules-based world order, what does that mean? OK, when I was in Ukraine in August I was in Irpin, where I heard the story of the Russian soldiers who raped children to death in front of their parents and then murdered their parents. That was one of tens of thousands of stories. That is what we are talking about. That is the world that we are trying to prevent us from living in. So let’s act accordingly.
Mr. Muradian: Both emotional and also sensible case. I would like to believe that it would be that direct that people get it. Russia has been at war with the West now for 20 years. And it’s – and, you know, and even after, right, we were celebrating the second anniversary. It’s actually the 10th anniversary of the first attack on Ukraine. And I find it astonishing that people are both, A, still surprised by that. And we also say Russia doesn’t have allies. It actually has very powerful allies – in China, in Iran, in North Korea – that are providing it bullets, unmanned systems, as well as the electronics that make their – and our – we’re not being tough enough on some of our allies, whether it’s Turkey or any one of a number of other countries, that are, you know, basically a back channel to, you know, whether it’s to move fuel around or electronics.
Dan, you had experience at Lockheed Martin after you left government, and then you were also with the Cohen Group. One of the things – America’s allies and – you know, Europe is a massive U.S. arms market. And a lot of allies and partners said, hey, American equipment is really, really good. And they allowed their own industries to atrophy because basically they’ve depended on us to fill that, much to the frustration in France who’s always said: Hey, we as Europeans really do need to maintain capability, as much of it in France as possible, but still maintain a European capability. Those voices are back now making the argument that we have to develop our own combat aircraft, we have to develop our own missilry, and we really need to do this so that a Dan or Kathleen in the future does not, you know, apply U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations and say, whoa, you know, you can re-export this to somebody I don’t want you to export it to.
In the end, and it’s their money. They’re investing it. Just like we look at this as a great investment, right? Something of the 95 billion (dollars), some of them – you know, 90 percent of it basically stays in the United States in terms of what that investment is, and in terms of weaponry. Is this already going to result in an entire new generation of systems that may be integrated, may be interoperable, but actually have far fewer American content in it than otherwise would have been before we started this sort of very transactional approach?
Mr. Fata: So you ask questions like I do, multiple layers, lots of stuff to go into.
Mr. Muradian: I’m sorry for too many layers. I apologize for that.
Mr. Fata: Too long to be able to respond to.
Mr. Muradian: But I thought I could layer-cake this. (Laughter.)
Mr. Fata: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So to get to the last part of your question, I don’t see a great drifting away from purchasing American arms. I think there’s multiple reasons. One is Europe still lacks the capability – the industrial capability to do anything massively at scale. And so you’ve seen over the past couple of years a lot of partnering with U.S. companies. So Boeing, Saab, Lockheed, working with a variety of different European companies. So they’re just – there is just sort of – in the short term, there’s this physical aspect, there isn’t enough production capacity.
Two, the European Commission still has rules on the book that prevent banks – European banks from providing loans to governments to purchase arms, right? And so –
Mr. Muradian: Which is just absurd.
Mr. Fata: Which is absurd. And so until you get that addressed, that’s a problem. And so I think what you’re going to see, particularly Central and Eastern Europeans, they will want to buy American whenever they can. And they will buck the European Commission. The Poles made a big purchase, as you know, last year, because the American capacity to be able to produce some armored personnel carriers and things just wasn’t there.
So they went to South Korea and got some very interesting terms. I think that may become a reality, where Europe – potentially some of your Central and Eastern Europeans. And in Kathleen’s chart, you see the spend that those – the frontline states are doing. They may have no alternative to buy – they may only be able to buy from either non-European or non-U.S. in the short term, because that’s the only place where production is happening.
But I do believe – and I was at an event with the one of the – with the assistant secretary of state for pol-mil the other day. And there was a big discussion amongst us about coproduction, license manufacturing with our Asian and European allies. And my point there, which I will say again here, is: If we’re going to go down this path where the U.S. and Europe are going to coproduce, codevelop, co-manufacture – license and manufacture stuff, let those conversations happen between the companies first without the government having a say as to, OK, we want you to talk, here are your profit margins, and here’s what you can and can’t do.
Let companies – let business figure that out first, then come to the government and say: Here’s where we need to make sure you’re OK with this. And so in that scenario, then I see a lot of connectivity between the U.S. and Europe in continuing to buy from each other. But I don’t see – just with the American industrial capacity, I don’t see America not being the primary arms provider for Europe for the foreseeable future.
Mr. Muradian: Do you fear a decoupling? Or does pragmatic reasons keep this all on track? Because I don’t have a single Tempest, Global Combat Aircraft, or SCAF discussion that does not go out of its way to say: We really have to minimize any American participation in this, both to rebuild our industries but also we can’t trust these bozos on the other side of the Atlantic.
Dr. McInnis: You know, I was just reminded, like, when I first entered the field, back in the days of yore, Bill Cohen was the Secretary of Defense. And I remember listening to his speech on the ESDP, the European pillar at the time, and there needed – it was like, no decoupling, no duplication. And there was another D. It was a three Ds kind of thing. And so we’re – (laughs) – it’s just interesting that we’re sort of still there. I mean, I think those principles still apply, right? You know, we need to ensure that our forces are interoperable with each other. And I think you’re right. Having businesses come together and defining how the collaboration could work and then bringing government in is probably the – certainly a less painful way of doing things. (Laughs.)
Mr. Fata: And it keeps the bond. Look, as I said to you before, at the end of the day I don’t think the former president ultimately is going to pull us out of NATO. He may make noise. It’ll be unsettling. The enemies will be watching. But I think he understands the economic ties between the U.S. and Europe. I think he understands the military bonds that are there. I think he understands at the end of the day, if there’s going to be someone that’s going to rally to America’s cause, like you pointed out after 9/11, it’s going to be the Europeans. And I think keeping the arms trade – that’s a term I hate – but keeping the arms trade going, the defense sales going between us, is a key aspect that he wouldn’t want to lose.
Mr. Muradian: From your mouth to God’s ears, as the expression goes, Dan. Last question. Seventy-fifth anniversary. You said we’re going to be dancing at the alliance’s 100th anniversary. You know, ideally, yes. But how does the nature of the discussion more broadly have to change, right? I mean, once upon a time this was more sort of front of mind. Now, Americans are becoming more concerned about both Russia and China. (Laughs.) Nothing like your adversary making your case for you. I mean, how does this – the discussion need to change? Is it an education issue? Is it a dialogue issue? Is that we’re having this discussion amongst ourselves in one of the most prominent think tanks in Washington is NATO-ites and national security people?
I mean, how does this discussion more broadly, have to change? I know that Michele Flournoy had talked about it. I think Bob Work has talked about this, John Hamre, the august head of CSIS and former deputy defense secretary. Has been, like, look, how do you make the case to the American people, ultimately? How do you make the case to make Americans actually go, hey, wait a minute, this is important, when they’re more interested in student loan relief, they’re more interested in inflation, or the price of gasoline?
Mr. Fata: The border. The border – or the border?
Mr. Muradian: Or, the border. Yeah, all of which I think is important, right?
Dr. McInnis: Yeah, we got to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. (Laughter.)
Mr. Muradian: Well, thank you, Lyndon Johnson.
Dr. McInnis: You’re welcome. No, look, I think it’s all of the above, right? And I think that, you know, what is principally missing from a lot of these discussions is that, you know, this is – we like to focus on technology, and widgets, in those sorts of things. It’s humans. Humans make alliances work. Humans, people, give support to an alliance or not. And we need to start connecting with people. How many STAFFDELs do we have going over to Ukraine? Not many. How many STAFFDELs do we have going over to Europe? When you look at the –one of the unintended consequences of reducing our posture in Europe from 400,000 at its height, and change, in the Cold War, to, what, 80-90,000 – whatever it is –
Mr. Fata: We’re still at about 120(,000), but we had dipped to about 80(,000).
Dr. McInnis: Yeah, that’s right. And one of the consequences is that we don’t have families and servicemembers rotating in and out all the time. The message that – the connections – the human connection of the transatlantic alliance has been let atrophy. So we’ve got to find more creative solutions to building those human connections, I think. And we also have to be much more honest with ourselves in having discussions about really hard issues like burden sharing, or responsibility sharing. And let’s take these things forward with a much more honest, I would say, and authentic way,
Mr. Muradian: Dan.
Mr. Fata: There’s no reason to be bashing on the alliance as it being ineffective. It hasn’t demonstrated that. It’s important to make sure that our leaders, our publics, exude this sense, this feeling of confidence that NATO is credible. Otherwise, why should we have it? And so I’m a big believer is it is credible and the U.S. has to be the leader of it. Kathleen and I have often talked about ways in which to make this story, this concept relevant to at least Americans and American lawmakers. What consistently works? TV, right? And it’s not just having a journalist do a short piece on 60 Minutes. It’s actually what we’ve seen great success, whether it be shows about Homeland or other things, when a viewer can now understand, oh, this seems more relevant and I see how this thing works.
And it may just be for a couple years there needs to be some kind of really big public awareness that involves TV and other things to make the case. I just worry that no matter who wins in 2024, the Europeans will still be questioning whether we are predictable and consistent. And that’s whether the former president is back in the White House or the current president remains in the White House, but there’s a Republican-controlled Congress that four or five members who just disagree with the premise can gum everything up.
And that sends a very bad message to the enemy. And hopefully, I would like to think, our American citizens realize that’s not the country I want. And I’ve heard great things about this NATO, and we haven’t had to fight in Europe in 75 years. You know, we need to make sure this is relevant. So that’s part of how we have to work at it to change the mindset and get it back to at least neutral, ideally being advocates for the alliance. But at least, get the venom out of it.
Mr. Muradian: The number-one obligation of leadership is communication and responsible communication. So you’re not going to get the venom out of it until people get the venom out of it, right? And if they keep injecting venom into it, it’s going to be a poisonous discussion. Do you have a last word, Madame Doctor?
Dr. McInnis: Thank you for this discussion and this this opportunity to really tease out some of these core issues, the things that have been leading up to the conversation and the discourse we’re having today. And how do we – how do we protect this alliance that has mattered so much to American security, so much American strategy, so much the American taxpayer? How do we keep it going until 100? That’s the question that’s before us as strategists, as policymakers. And it’s time to get to work.
Mr. Fata: And we have five months until the summit to get that answer out.
Dr. McInnis: Mmm hmm.
Mr. Muradian: Well –
Mr. Fata: Otherwise, it’s a birthday party.
Mr. Muradian: Otherwise, it’s a birthday party. And, you know, indeed, you have to keep it going and make sure that it’s an anniversary. Dr. Kathleen McInnis, director of the Smart Women, Smart Power Initiative here at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and Senior Advisor Dan Feta, thanks very much. Honor and a pleasure. And a reminder to the audience to go to CSIS.org to get this report. I’m Mago Muradian and of the Defense and Aerospace Report. Honored to be here. Thanks very much and look forward to continuing the discussion.
Mr. Fata: Thanks, Vago.
Dr. McInnis: Thank you.

Dr. Eliot A. Cohen: Hello. My name is Eliot Cohen. I’m the Arleigh Burke Chair in Strategy here at CSIS. And I’m pleased to welcome you to a conversation with General Wesley Clark.
General Clark has a long and distinguished career of military service. He was a graduate of West Point, a Rhodes scholar, wounded and decorated in Vietnam, served in many capacities including as the Head of Plans on the Joint Staff, and then as Supreme Allied Commander Europe 1997 to 2000. And he remains an active observer and participant in debates about national security. We’re going to be talking with him about Ukraine, about the war, about things that we might have done better, that we need to do better, and its larger implications.
General Clark, welcome to CSIS.
General Wesley K. Clark (Ret.): Thank you very much, Eliot.
Dr. Cohen: So let me begin with the question, how do you assess the American government’s performance in Ukraine? What have we done right? What have we done wrong? And what consequences has it had?
Gen. Clark: Well, let’s start by going back to the beginning. We’ve never handled Putin the right way. We didn’t handle him the right way in the second Bush administration because, clearly, he’s not a Christian and he doesn’t really exhibit Christian values, despite having worn a cross when he met with President Bush. We didn’t handle him the right way after he invaded Georgia during the Olympics of 2008. We didn’t handle him the right way with the reset in the Obama administration. We didn’t handle him the right way when we invited him into Syria. And we didn’t understand what he was doing in Ukraine in 2013 and ’14.
Dr. Cohen: Can I just pause you there and ask, why do you think that’s the case? I mean, you’ve had a long career of dealing with Russians, first looking at them on the other side of the inter-German border but then negotiating with them after the end of communism. What accounts for this misreading, which, you know, if you think about the different presidencies that you’re talking about here – Republicans, Democrats, different flavors of both – why?
Gen. Clark: We never really opened up the Soviet Union after it collapsed. The same people rebranded themselves as parliamentarians. Many of them were KGB. They’d been through a KGB school. The book “Putin’s People” lays all this out very clearly. We didn’t really understand it at the time.
We sent a few economists from the Chicago school over there and said, oh, get rid of these state-owned industries. We created oligarchs.
President Clinton thought he had a great relationship with Boris Yeltsin, but even Yeltsin told him: We don’t want NATO to expand. And the people in Eastern Europe understood this very well. The Foreign Minister of Bulgaria told me in 1997 – she said: Look, today, Russia’s weak. Someday, it’s going to be strong again. They’ll be back, and before that time we’ve got to be in NATO. They understand the Russian imperialist urge. And it’s been fostered and nurtured by the – by the Communist Party even more than the czars did. And so Putin is the heir of that – more than that; he’s totally the apostle of it.
So from the beginning, in 1999, when he was at Kuchma’s inauguration – President Kuchma in Ukraine – his speech went something like this. He was the prime minister at the time, not the president of Russia. He said: Ukraine and Russia, we are more than brothers. We are in each other’s souls. The Polish National Security Advisor flew to meet me the next week and he said: We’re going to have big problems with Putin. He’s trying to recreate the Soviet Union. And he gave me some examples that they’d already seen.
So our political leaders in the West just – we can’t imagine – when we deal with people and they speak and we have a dialogue and we share coffee or a dinner table, we can’t imagine they don’t think like us. Putin doesn’t think like us. He is an intelligence agent who is imbued with a messianic zeal to restore the greatness of the Soviet Union. He said as much in 2007. We should have taken him at his word.
But to go back to Ukraine, Eliot, in 2014 we actually told the Ukrainians to give up Crimea. They had the Russian green men in their sights. They would have resisted. They understood in their military what this was about even then. And we told them, give up Crimea. And then, of course, there was a lot of confusion, and suddenly these people showed up in Donbas, and people said, well, they might be a Russian intelligence agent. Yeah, they were Russian intelligence agents. They tried to do what we do with our Special Forces, which was create an indigenous movement. It didn’t work very well. They did assassinate some Christian missionaries in there and they rounded up some hooligans and criminals, but ultimately to take over the part of Donbas they had to have the Russian army come in and to support them. And in 2014, we had these poor Russian soldiers, they took away their phones, took away their ID cards, said you’re going on an exercise, and suddenly they’re being shot at and shooting back at the Ukrainians inside Ukraine. And we let all that pass.
When Poroshenko was elected in 2014 and came to Brussels and asked for military assistance, and he gave President Obama the list of what he needed, we left.
Dr. Cohen: But –
Gen. Clark: We said no. No M1s. (Laughs.) No F-16s. No MLRS. And until 2022, there was an eight-year war with 10(,000), 12(,000), 14,000 people killed just holding the line in Donbas. That’s where it starts.
So is there a problem with American policy? Sure. Goes back a long way.
Dr. Cohen: Yeah. I think, you know, you and I both have been in Kyiv, and one of the things I know that struck me on my first visit is that wall with pictures of all the soldiers who fell in 2014 and since – before this – the full-scale – the full-scale invasion.
Gen. Clark: Right. Right.
Dr. Cohen: Well, first I want to ask you just on the Obama administration’s decisions. Do you think this is naïveté at work, or fear?
Gen. Clark: I think it was naïveté. And there were people inside the White House and out – I went to Les Gelb at the Conference on Foreign – Council on Foreign Relations after I got back. Les is an old friend of mine, and he was a Democrat, and he was considered, you know, sort of left of where I was when I was working for Al Haig. And I said: Les, you’ve got to help us on this. I mean, this is a war of conquest of Ukraine. But the people he had – he knew that were advising Obama were, like, no, this is a misunderstanding, and you know, Ukraine’s not really a separate country, and there’s always been these frictions, and this is about money and organized crime, and don’t take this seriously; we need Putin to help us with the Iran nuclear agreement. And so the Obama administration, at least from what I could see from the outside, had made two fundamental mistakes.
Number one, when they announced the pivot to Asia, it seemed as though we weren’t interested in what was happening in Europe. It’s that snatch of a quote that Obama said, maybe innocently, to Putin; said, I’ll have more freedom after the – after I’m reelected. And maybe that – whatever it was, we somehow gave the nod to the Russians to say, look, we’re interested in space and we’re interested in Asia. Don’t mess with us there, but you can do what you want in Egypt, be good friends with the – in Europe. Be good friends with the Germans, and do what you want, and you know, we’re going to have a good relationship. And I think the drive toward the problem with Israel, the Iranian nuclear thrust, trying to forestall a conflict in the Middle East led the Obama administration to bring Putin in, let him into the Middle East and also not really take seriously what he was doing in Ukraine.
Dr. Cohen: So let’s move forward to 2022. I think most of us would probably agree that the Biden administration did a pretty good job of alerting people that this was going to happen, that – you know, they shared more intelligence, I think, than was normally the case. But then the question becomes aid and assistance and advice. And that’s the story, now, that’s been going on for more than two years, because, after all, the Ukrainians have been asking for various kinds of weapons for a very long time. Could you assess that, and particularly assess it as a – as a military professional looking at the kind of assistance we’ve given them, how much, when? And also the critical question of advice because, you know, we’ve played a role there, too. So if you’d open up on that and tell us.
Gen. Clark: So, Eliot, here’s what I think happened. And of course, we may never know the truth of all this. But when President Biden met Mr. Putin in the summer of 2021, I think they had a very civil conversation. And according to the readout, President Biden said, look, we’d like you to be a responsible statesman and so forth. At that point, we already knew that there were plans that Russia had to invade Ukraine. They’d rehearsed it in the spring of 2021. They moved forward, but there were some reasons why they didn’t do it then. But after the Afghanistan coming apart and so forth and having the meeting with Putin, I was rooting for President Biden to say: Don’t you dare go into Ukraine. We will block you, we will oppose you, and you will fail. But apparently it was a very gentlemanly conversation.
Then the information started to come out as the Russians maneuvered in the fall of 2021, and apparently there was a meeting between the head of the Central Intelligence Agency and either Putin’s number two, Patrushev, or Putin himself. And we don’t know the details on this, but somehow I’m sure it was, like, we told the Russians: Don’t do this. Don’t invade. This is a big mistake. Don’t do it. And Putin or his guy probably said: What are you talking about? That’s not even a country. That’s just Ukraine. That’s part of Russia. That’s like us telling you you can’t do anything in Texas. This is our country.
And then it must have morphed into something different, in which there were red lines discussed – maybe, like, if you go in there, you’re risking a confrontation and something. Well, if you don’t give the Ukrainians weapons to strike us, maybe, you know, you’ll be safe in NATO and we won’t – we won’t hurt NATO at this point. Or maybe there was some exchange like that. Somehow, red lines must have emerged from this, because from the beginning we were worried about red lines – Putin’s red lines, not our red lines.
Now, the Secretary of State was giving speeches about the importance of the rules-based international order. To me, what that meant was national boundaries, legitimate boundaries, they are sacrosanct. But instead of standing on that principle as the attack approached and the day of the attack – and it became more and more ominous, we pulled our trainers out of the Yavoriv camp in western Ukraine, where they could have served as a deterrence. Or, a number of us said: This thing’s getting bad. Send an air expeditionary force to Romania. Put the ambiguity in there that will underscore American deterrence. But we didn’t do that. We made sure we didn’t do that.
And when it came time in the second or third day of the operation when it was clear we were going to have a problem with airpower, there were some of us who suggested to the White House: You need to – (laughs) – don’t give up the airspace to Russia. It belongs to Ukraine. If you believe in the rules-based international order, you have to act on that belief. That’s our airspace if Ukraine says to come in, and we should support them with that. Harry Truman did it in 1950. But instead, what we said is: Oh my God, no. No. We don’t want a confrontation with Russia. We mouthed the words of the rules-based order, but we didn’t act on them.
Dr. Cohen: Yeah.
Gen. Clark: And then all the military assistance we gave was penny parceled out. It was agonizing in the White House. It must have been really difficult. What are the red lines? What will Putin do? Can the Ukrainians – and there were a lot of excuses.
The Ukrainians aren’t smart enough. Well, they got more educated people than we do in our armed forces, to be honest with you. Much better science and technology in the schools in Ukraine than we have in the United States.
Well, the terrain is no good for an M1 tank. Really? Then why did we sell them to Poland?
Well, they’re not – it's too complicated. Really? So we left them in Iraq and the Egyptians have them; the Ukrainians can’t?
I mean, it was a combination of doubletalk, misleading information, requests that weren’t answered.
Dr. Cohen: Do you think that was on the military side as well as the civilian side? Because –
Gen. Clark: Yes. I think there was a certain arrogance in our military.
Now, look, I’m sorry. We did a lot of things right, OK? I don’t want to say we didn’t do everything right. We built the alliance. We got out the warning. We held NATO together. We didn’t have a confrontation with Russia. OK, plus, plus, plus, plus. But you’re asking me: How could it have gone better? So I take all those things for given – as givens. Of course we tried to build an alliance. Maybe Donald Trump wouldn’t have, but we did, and we did that very well. And won the information war at the beginning because we alerted everybody to what was going on. So I don’t want my friends to think that, you know, it’s all negative. It could have been a lot worse. And we did give them Stingers and some Javelins; not enough.
But really, we’re in the fourth phase of the war. The first phase was the failed Russian offensive. They weren’t ready. They didn’t understand the – the second phase was the Ukrainian grab everything and build up. The third phase, the counteroffensive, which ran into the big barrier system. And now we’re in the fourth phase.
And the point is, we’ve got thousands of tanks in the United States; we’ve sent 31. We have a whole fleet of A-10 Warthogs out there sitting in the desert; we’re going to get rid of them. They’re still sitting there. We have hundreds of F-16s that are around, and we delayed it and delayed it and delayed it. We have ATACMS that are obsolete. We’ve still got 155 dual-purpose ICM munitions that we didn’t send. It was – it was measured. The response was measured. It was calibrated. And what many of us in the military tried to say is: Look, I understand, you know, the policy is we don’t want Ukraine to lose and we don’t want Russian to win, OK? That’s the policy. But you can’t calibrate combat like that. You either use decisive force to win or you risk losing.
And what’s happened is we refused to given the Ukrainians decisive force or the means for decisive force when they could have won more easily, and instead we’ve sort of bled out our Ukrainian force, and we’ve got guys in their thirties and forties in there fighting, and some of them have been in the line for a year or two years. The Ukrainians had to put reservists in. They had to put people in there who drove their own POVs up to the frontline and dismounted and walked in with nothing but AK-47s and a helmet, and some of them didn’t even have a helmet. So they did an amazing job, given the restrictions that were put on.
Dr. Cohen: Do you think we gave them bad military advice? I’m talking at the sort of military-technical level.
Gen. Clark: Well, I think – I think at the – I think we were overly restrictive in terms of how we approached the sort of legal responsibilities. I know we don’t want become a party to the conflict, OK but, you know, we could have gone in there and with civilian contractors we could have organized people to take care of the 777 artillery pieces.
No sooner did they get those artillery pieces in the summer of 2022 than a third of them were inoperative because they didn’t have the maintenance parts and the channels weren’t prepared and we tried to do everything at that point through a small office in the U.S. embassy in Kyiv, and the defense attaché was probably going crazy with it.
There were guys in the U.S. military in Dallas who did heroic work and they put their hearts and souls into this. But starting at the top the idea was that we don’t want a confrontation. Keep NATO out of this. Well, Ukraine – they were really surprised. Ukraine can fight, no kidding, and they are going to fight.
But we didn’t take the risk. We didn’t see it right. We didn’t give the right military advice in there to say you can’t fine tune a conflict. It has momentum. It has a life of its own. You’ve got to go in there to win, and we never said as a policy that we wanted Ukraine to win.
Dr. Cohen: That’s absolutely right. I mean, I’ve always thought that there was something really deeply problematic about saying, you know, we’re going to be with you to the end but we don’t – we’re not willing to say we want you to win and, by the way, we want Russia to lose.
One question I’ve always had is it always seemed to me it would have been a good thing to have had a military advisory group there, that is to say to have the American soldiers not in combat but in country advising, training, but among other things establishing relationships with Ukrainian officers and military leaders and getting a better – simply getting a better sense of the reality on the ground.
I mean, my own feeling is we’ve had a lot of quarterbacking from a distance of – from people who – some of whom have never been in Ukraine because the government won’t let them go, not because they don’t want to go.
Is that a legitimate criticism?
Gen. Clark: I think it’s a legitimate criticism, yeah, and I think there’s something else, and I don’t want to be overly critical of our own armed forces because it’s a volunteer force and the Army has done incredible work and how we held together during the 20 years in Afghanistan and the time in Iraq and the great work done by our Special Forces and the generals who pulled all this and getting the recruits in there and building the equipment and now having to face China.
I mean, it’s just that what happened is that the expertise of facing the Eighth Guard’s army across the inter-German border was lost in all of that and –
Dr. Cohen: Could you explain what you mean by that? Because, I mean, I think you and I both know that.
Gen. Clark: During the Cold War period we had about 300,000 U.S. Army in Europe and all the heavy forces leaders – and I was a tank officer – and you had repetitive tours. You went there as a lieutenant or a captain you were back as a major or a lieutenant colonel or a colonel or as a general and you saw it again and again and you had to deal with the reality of what was on the other side of the inter-German border which was a formidable complete Soviet force.
I was in Ukraine as a NATO commander and met with the Minister of Defense and we had a nice talk in 2000, and he had been the commander of a tank army during the Cold War and he told me – he said, we’d have been on the English Channel in five days.
Dr. Cohen: Did you believe him?
Gen. Clark: So it’s the kind of professionalism that was there in the Soviet armed forces. It wasn’t like our armed forces, but they had a powerful group of artillery, tanks pushing the East Germans first, radio electronic combat, non-eye-safe laser range fighters on their tanks so they had blinding weapons.
And as one of their Spetsnaz guys told me he said, before the war ever started we would have assassinated all of your generals. We knew where everybody lived and we would have had the people in there. One guy told me – he said, you know, I came across many times as a truck driver to Rotterdam and we looked all through your forces and reconned everything.
So but the leaders who did that – they’re retired. The intelligence assets that we had who spent careers studying the Soviet Union, they were gone. They became terrorist experts or something else.
And so during this critical period leading up to the conflict we didn’t have the eyes and ears focused. We didn’t really understand what was going on; it probably didn’t get up to the policy network. But for whatever reason we started at a huge disadvantage and our armed forces leaders were suddenly looking at China and long-range fires and suddenly it’s about tanks and trenches and obstacles.
And so I think there’s a lot of learning that has to come out of this. I would love to see a group of retired generals who – there’s still some alive who really worked it during the Cold War as advisors in there. But that hasn’t happened, and so we could have done more even within the framework of the policy.
Dr. Cohen: Could we shift a bit – and the time is flying by – to – could you give me your assessment of where you think the war is today? You know, you said that there are four phases. We’re in the middle of the fourth phase which is a Russian offensive. It’s had major success in terms of taking the town of Avdiivka.
Could you talk about – well, where do you think this goes from here? What are some of the following phases? I mean, there are obviously different branches and sequels here one of which is, of course, crucially the American election.
But could you walk us through your – you know, your expert analysis of the war?
Gen. Clark: Well, I think if we pass the assistance bill and we treat Ukraine the same way in crisis as we treated Israel – in 1973 we actually took stuff out of our own forces in Germany and flew it into Israel and we needed to have done so and we’re doing almost that today.
If we treated Ukraine that way and actually brought the stuff to them and really got that distributed we could stabilize where we are right now and then with the right additional equipment in 12 to 14 months of work there’s a chance they can break through the Russian lines somewhere. It could be Donetsk. It could be Crimea. It could be an air envelopment.
But they’ve got to have the tools of modern warfare. You can’t expect them to fight without air superiority. The drones are great. Build more drones, and they’re ingenious and their action development cycle is faster than the Russians. But the Russians will catch up.
And so it’s a moving target you’re going against. We have to recognize that this war is in a very dangerous stage right now and if that bill isn’t passed the Ukrainian forces are not like – they’re not like what we envision the American Army to be. They’re not all armored, mobile, and all connected the right way.
They’re not capable, I don’t think, of waging an effective war of movement and if there’s a breakthrough and it slices in toward Kharkiv or even further toward Kyiv and if you want to put up that map.
Dr. Cohen: Yeah. Why don’t we put up the map?
Gen. Clark: I mean, it’s a long way. But it’s going to pose – that’s a 600-mile front and you look over there Kyiv is about 450, 500 miles away from where that battle is right now. But that’s mostly rolling, wooded, and open terrain. There are some river lines that have to be crossed but the toughest terrain is where the fighting is right now.
And so we’d be – we need a different focus for the Ukrainian army if it’s going to fight a war of movement. It doesn’t need 31 tanks and a hundred Leopard tanks. It needs a thousand, 2,000 tanks.
It doesn’t need a few – 300 towed artillery pieces. It needs self-propelled artillery, and it needs not 25 F-16s – it needs a couple hundred F-16s and a couple hundred A-10s, and it’s not going to happen quickly enough.
So they’ve got to hold this line and that means when that aid package comes through we’ve got to put – we’ve got to find a way to get that artillery ammunition and the new systems in there and distribute it as rapidly as possible.
Dr. Cohen: Do your successors as general officers and flag officers in the United States and elsewhere understand things, you think, the same way you do in terms of the scale of what’s needed and the urgency of what’s needed? I mean, we’ve talked about the political leadership and about the fear of escalation and so on and so forth. I’m curious, on the military side, do you think that need is sufficiently well understood?
Gen. Clark: I think it’s a staggering bill, and I think General Cavoli over there understands it very, very well. If we don’t stop them here, we’re going to have a 2,500-mile front with NATO. And we could – we really couldn’t handle 400 miles of the inter-German border in the Cold War. I can’t imagine what it will take to sort of mobilize NATO if Ukraine falls and we’re faced with a threat that runs from the Baltics all the way down to the Black Sea.
Dr. Cohen: Let me ask you just one other kind of military technical question, and that is Russian performance. Before the war, there was a lot of talk about, you know, the Russians were going to roll over all of Ukraine. In fact, I’m part of a project here at CSIS with Phillips O’Brien of St. Andrews University on the initial analysis of the Russian-Ukrainian military balance, which was way, way off. I mean, the Russians were far less competent and effective than anybody anticipated to such a degree that we should think about it.
But that was two years ago. And as somebody who’s interacted with the Russians, who’s studied them, who’s observed them closely, how do you assess the evolution of the Russian military throughout this?
Gen. Clark: You know, first of all, they didn’t really – the Russian military really never had much say in the first phase of the operation. That was an intelligence operation. And it was set to put a few helicopter-landed troops in there and then an internal revolt and then get rid of Zelensky, and then they assumed that they could put Yanukovich back in and suddenly they’d have Ukraine. It was like a coup de main. And so they weren’t deployed for combat. And when the dam was broken and the roads were flooded and they couldn’t get off road, they didn’t have the logistics, air defense, electronic warfare, or artillery actually deployed. What they had were battalion tactical groups, and some will have made it south of the Lviv-Kyiv road, and but they ran out of guidance and logistics. They couldn’t get the logistics in. It was a misreading of true Russian military capabilities.
And then they tried to reorganize, and that was a fumbling difficult thing also in combat. And by the way, we were assisting the Ukrainians with some powerful assistance that is not disclosable. But it contributed to the difficulties that the Russians had in phase two. But when they put the defense in, they know how to defend, and they had a lot of mines, and they had a lot of automatic mine-laying equipment.
The way the Soviets thought is the way the Russians think. We learned that for us battles are won at the bottom. It’s the individual soldier, the guy with the rifle. He’s the one who actually makes the advance possible. The Russians operate exactly the opposite. For them, a soldier is like a bullet. You got so many bullets, you got so many soldiers, you’re going to use this many bullets today, and that many soldiers, throw them in there. And so when we look at the horrendous losses the Russians have taken, and we look at it, we interpret it through our own values system, my God, they’re getting killed out there. Surely, they’re going to stop? Well, no, no. What they’re going to do is call for another round of mobilization, put some more warm bodies up there to get shot. It doesn’t have the same impact on the chain of command. Now, it might have an impact on the mothers, but Putin has maintained very capable control of the information space inside Russia.
So, you know, we knew early on, we got to get some people in there to talk common sense to the Russian people. We’ve got to find a way to do it. We haven’t been able to do it. So understand, Eliot, that what we’re dealing with is a totally asymmetrical military relationship. The Ukrainians, they’re fighting like we would fight. They love their people. They’re taking care of their soldiers. They want to save every life they can. For the Russians, that’s not the case. Orders come from the top down and you either perform as an officer and throw your people into the breach and go into it if you have to, or else.
Dr. Cohen: Let me push the question a little bit further. So, they’ve – I mean, I absolutely take what you say. But still by British estimates, Ukrainian estimates, they’ve taken somewhere on the order of about 400,000 combat casualties.
Gen. Clark: Right.
Dr. Cohen: Dead and wounded who are effectively off the battlefield or prisoner. We – I mean, an amazing thing these days, you can document equipment losses using open sources. They’ve had extraordinary losses of equipment, which they don’t really seem to be able to replace and their own military industry can’t do it. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be turning to North Korea and Iran and so on.
Gen. Clark: Right, yeah.
Dr. Cohen: And even with the human losses, while there are plenty of – you know, they’ll keep on sending warm bodies into the fight, they’ve also been losing the captains and majors and lieutenant colonels and even the generals to a degree that, you know, we really never have. Does that degrade their overall effectiveness to some extent?
Gen. Clark: Sure, because experience matters on the battlefield, and you don’t get the experience and you don’t use it unless you survive. But on the other hand, the Russian, and before them the Soviet troop leading procedures, are very different from ours.
Dr. Cohen: Could you say a little bit more about that?
Gen. Clark: So in the Western army and the way we’ve tried to work with the Ukrainians over the years is the troop leading works at the bottom. You get a mission. It’s a zone. You give it to the commander down below you. He thinks about it, he subdivides it, gives it down, and then it rolls back up. And in the Russian system and the Soviet system, it’s all done on norms, so that this unit for an attack has this zone. And the commander plans the operation. In the American Western system, we teach how staff work. The staff in the Russian system only does the execution. The plan is the commander’s, and he alone is responsible for it and he must do it. And what this gives or has historically done is made the Soviet system very flexible at the top and very casualty-prone at the bottom. And it’s the exact opposite of the way we’ve tried to work. So the losses they’ve taken would have been absolutely just totally destructive for a Western force. But for the Russian force, there’s certain rules you follow. This is the way you do it. Here it is, it’s a cookbook, you do it, or you’re a traitor. And so it’s easier for them to fill in the replacements at the bottom – not necessarily at the top, but at the bottom it is. And they’re still having problems. And you know, all is not lost in this by any means for the West or for Ukraine. But we have to understand what we’re up against.
And, Eliot, the United States has to understand we’re in a new era. There’s a coalition of forces, nations forming up against the United States. It’s Russia, it’s China, it’s North Korea, it’s Iran. They’re increasingly well-coordinated, exchanging information plans, tactics, munitions, technologies that our principal potential adversaries, starting with Russia, are willing to use force in a major way. We didn’t see this in the post-Cold War. It was a shock when Russia really invaded Ukraine. And we’re looking at China. We’re looking at Iran. We’re looking at North Korea, which has just said it’s no longer aiming for a nice peaceful reunification with the South. So the third thing is that our nuclear deterrent is in play in a way that it hasn’t been before.
Dr. Cohen: Say more about what you mean by that.
Gen. Clark: We’ve taken the nuclear deterrent for granted since the end of the Cold War. Nobody likes nuclear weapons. It could cause nuclear – a nuclear global winter. We could shut down civilization. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists Doomsday Clock is two seconds from midnight, and on and on and on. But the truth is, we stopped our nuclear program in 1983 when President Reagan said we’re not going to do the enhanced radiation warheads. And the Russians didn’t. And they’ve brought out new nuclear technology and new delivery systems. They’re way ahead of us. They must think there’s value in it. The Chinese are doing the same thing. And there must be value in it, because the first thing that we’ve been nervous about in supporting Ukraine is Putin and Medvedev and other people giving these nuclear threats. And we keep saying that’s irresponsible as though you’re sitting around the coffee table, don’t be talking like that. But for them, it’s highly responsible, because what they see is they see timidity on the part of the West when confronted with the reality that Russia has nuclear weapons and might use them in this case.
And then you have to ask – and this is what our Western leaders have to ask – how strongly do we believe in this rules-based international system? Strongly enough to fight for it? Or we’re going to say it’s NATO? Well, if you won’t fight for Ukraine when they’re fighting, how do you think the people in the Baltic States feel? They’re on the edge out there. Do they think the United States is really going to risk nuclear confrontation with Putin to save Talin? Will we do that? We say we will legally, but will we? What’s the real credibility? And so our deterrent is in question in a way it hasn’t been.
And this latest flap over the Russian nuclear weapon in space, this is – we’ve worried about this for a long time. And back in the 1980s, back when you were a young man –
Dr. Cohen: Could you explain – why would somebody put a nuclear weapon up in space? Could you explain that?
Gen. Clark: If that weapon goes off in space, it creates an electromagnetic pulse that can disable satellites. But of course, it also disables things on the ground. It depends on the altitude, the size of the nuclear weapon, et cetera. But it could completely wipe out the U.S. electricity grid for much of the United States with just one weapon, depending on where it is, its altitude, and its strength. So to say there’s not going to be any impact on the ground, it’s – well, I mean, maybe if it’s a one-tenth of a kiloton at 22,000 miles, maybe not. But if it’s a megaton class weapon at 300 miles, it’s a really serious problem.
And so we’re dancing around all these things. No, we don’t want a confrontation with Russia. But like we used to say in army training, the enemy has a vote. And Putin is pushing a confrontation with us, and he’s lining up his allies. It’s just – this is military. It’s diplomatic. It’s financial with the BRICS and other efforts. And I think, you know, we have to recognize for the United States, we’re in a new era. The old ideas that, you know, we’re a shining example – President Reagan said, we’re a city on a hill. Everybody wants to live in a democratic country like the United States. And we certainly have a lot of people who want to live here. But the politics of democracy are difficult, even in America. And there are alternative models. And with the development of – economic developments around the world, there’s wealth elsewhere, and there are people looking to retain that wealth. So the old models, the idea that we were the indispensable exceptional power, we’d like to be, but the times, they are a-changing, and we’ve got to adapt our policy to this new era.
Dr. Cohen: Yeah. Well, that’s – you put a lot on the table there.
Let me go back to nuclear weapons for a moment. Do you expect that – or how would you assess the chances that sometime in the next 10, 20 years somebody actually uses a nuclear weapon for military purposes?
Gen. Clark: Well, we – if you asked that question 30 years ago, people would have said it’s high. It always is going to be possible. But it’s hard to find the scenario who’s going to do it, when. So if we back away from a confrontation with Putin, he’s not going to use a nuclear weapon. He doesn’t want to open that box either even though he has tactical weapons and we don’t. He has artillery and short-range rocket-delivered weapons that would be actually quite useful on the battlefield, especially if the Ukrainians are not dug in. If they’re in the open, these enhanced radiation weapons that he has, supposedly, they could be very effective.
Dr. Cohen: Why do you think he –
Gen. Clark: But he doesn’t want – he doesn’t want to cross that. China doesn’t want across it. They want us to give without raising that – the conflict to that level. So it’s what Putin said: Give Back Ukraine, unroll NATO, get these Baltic States back out of NATO, give up on it. Let Russia have what it wants.
Dr. Cohen: What would be the consequences in your view? Could you just sort of play out the scenario in which – whether it’s because of the outcome of the election, or you know, a deadlocked Congress, you know, we don’t deliver aid to Ukraine? The Ukraine suffers a substantial defeat of some kind, which could be in variety of ways. What do you think? Just play out for us what would be the kind of cascade of events you think that might follow that.
Gen. Clark: Well, I think in some countries in Eastern Europe you might have changes of government, because there are Russian tendrils everywhere, especially in Eastern Europe. And people say, well, you know, this is too dangerous. We don’t have our army together. NATO can’t really protect us yet. We’ve got to buy for time on this. So we’ve got to sort of acquiesce to certain things. And I think that’s the normal way that diplomacy unfolds in something like this.
But I think, in this country, of course, there’d be political repercussions. I go back to the Vietnam War. And I’m a little bit older than you. I was at Oxford in 1968 when Tet happened. And just before that, in the months before that, the American commander had said, there’s light at the end of the tunnel. We’re successful in Vietnam. It’s going to be over pretty soon. Suddenly, there was what looked like a catastrophe. And out of the woodwork came these incredible forces that overran major parts of Vietnam, northern part of South Vietnam, and even got inside the American Embassy and onto our air bases. And in the American news media it was portrayed as a catastrophic defeat for the United States. Well, it wasn’t actually. It was a military defeat for the other side. But we lost the war of public opinion. And a lot of the support for the United – by the United States to Ukraine has been premised on the idea that these brave plucky Ukrainians can show the big bad Russians that they’re not 10 feet tall, democracy is going to win. But in Tet, that support for Vietnam was punctured. And one thing you have to respect about Vladimir Putin and the Russian intelligence network is they are students of history. And they see this, and they’re looking at this, and they would love to have a repeat of Tet in the spring of 2024.
Dr. Cohen: Well, that’s a pretty dark note in which to end the conversation, but I think, you know, there’s probably no human endeavor about which it’s more true than war that it pays to be sober about what the possibilities are. So –
Gen. Clark: Well, Eliot, I think, you know, we have to look at it with as much balance as possible. The Ukrainians have done a magnificent job, and we’ve given them a lot of support. But we didn’t give them sufficient support at the right time, in my view, to be able to take advantage of Russian disorganization. And now as General Zaluzhnyi said, it’s a positional war. And if we’re going to commit to the success of the international rules-based order, then we’ve got to help Ukraine restore its legitimate boundaries. Otherwise, it’s a Russian victory and it’s the beginning of the unraveling of that order.
Dr. Cohen: Agreed. And on that note, General Clark, thank you so much for joining us.
Gen. Clark: Thank you.

Last March, it was hard to miss the sense of satisfaction on the face of Wang Yi. Having just brokered a peace agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran, the former Chinese foreign minister gently nudged his two counterparts together. He stood between them and was in firm control.
There was every reason for Wang to feel satisfied. China had not only done what many considered impossible, but it was also the only country that possibly could—or so the argument went. The two countries were enemies, but each trusted China. The United States was focused on Middle East security, but China was actually providing it. Wang’s improbable success was yet another sign of China’s rising role in the Middle East.
And yet, for the past four months, the confident Chinese diplomacy of last March has been absent. As the Middle East has slid into violence, there has been no sign of Chinese mediation and little sign of actual Chinese diplomacy—despite more than a half-century of support for Palestinians, more than a decade of close ties with Israel, and tens of billions of dollars of investment in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and beyond.

62,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/strategic-approach-red-sea-security,Jon B. Alterman,"February 14, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"Jon Alterman testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee about the Houthi threat to Middle East stability and shipping in the region. Chairman Wilson, Ranking Member Connolly, distinguished members of the subcommittee, I am honored to share my views with you on this hearing entitled, “Iran’s Proxy in Yemen: The Houthi Threat to Middle East Stability, Global Shipping, and U.S. Servicemembers.” CSIS does not take policy positions, so the views represented in this testimony are my own and not those of my employer. In my testimony, I would like to lay out a strategic approach to Red Sea security.
The Houthis are a paradox. A rag-tag military operating on a shoestring budget, which doesn’t even represent a state, should not be a difficult adversary for the most powerful military in the world. Similarly, it should be easy for the United States to build a broad military coalition to protect freedom of navigation through seas that carry about 20 percent of global container trade and is a key conduit of both energy and manufactured goods to Europe. And yet, here we are, with Houthi forces continually threatening global shipping, and the United States working principally with UK partners to strike at Houthi targets, while regional allies and NATO partners keep their distance.
There is a way to see the Houthis mostly as a function of Iran’s malevolence and regional mischief-making. Some call for robust U.S. military strikes on Iran to punish the Iranian government for all of its destabilizing regional actions. Some call for crushing the Houthis completely. I understand the attraction of the logic of asserting U.S. military power and decisively deterring our adversaries. Yet, doing so without clear forethought would actually advance Iranian goals rather than U.S. ones, and they wouldn’t do much to stabilize Yemen. Deterrence, after all, requires a lot more than military might. It requires understanding the motivations, goals, preferences, and perceptions of one’s adversaries. It also requires an ability to assure those adversaries that if their behavior improves, their conditions will improve as well. Most fundamentally, the way deterrence works is it provokes our adversaries to make political choices.
Too often when we talk about deterrence, we really mean compellence. We see it as a military task with military outcomes. Compellence is much harder than deterrence because it requires public concessions that have political costs that governments are often loath to pay. Often, they calculate that they are better off absorbing our military hits and rallying the public around the flag than looking weak to their people. When we fall into the trap of escalating without success, we advance our adversaries’ political agenda despite degrading their military capabilities. In the process, we get no closer to changing the behavior we are seeking to reform.
Let me begin by discussing the Houthis. They are a robust, battle-tested guerilla force based in the highlands of Northern Yemen that has been fighting the Yemeni and Saudi governments for much of the last two decades. Their supporters are for the most part poor and deeply alienated, and they complain that their cultural mores are being destroyed by a combination of cosmopolitan elites and Saudi-inspired religious revivalists, both of whom work at the behest of foreign powers. The Yemeni highlands have a long history of enthusiasm for weapons and marksmanship, and tribal militias and other security forces have been an important part of their identity for many years. Some of the Houthis’ sentiments should not seem foreign to us.
As the Yemeni government began to crumble in the aftermath of the Arab Spring, the Houthis spread decisively out of the North and at one point seemed poised to seize the entire country. Yemen has a mosaic of tribes and sectarian affiliations (as well as a significant and diverse non-tribal population), but the Houthis were able to co-opt and coerce large areas, and they now rule over more than 70 percent of Yemen’s population.
The Houthis’ revenues come from a combination of war profiteering, racketeering, smuggling, and taxation. Rather than build the national economy of Yemen, they have further immiserated it.
Iran did not create the Houthi movement, but it has long seen it as useful. In part, supporting the Houthis was a way to torment Saudi Arabia, which the Iranians have long seen as their principal regional challenge. A secure Saudi Arabia could turn its attention to Iran, but one that was preoccupied with challenges from Yemen—as Saudi Arabia has been off and on for many decades—would need to disperse its energies. In addition, Iranian investments in the Houthis gave Iran leverage in their dealings with Saudi Arabia. The Houthis, for their part, had their own longstanding grievances with Saudi Arabia and were delighted to have an external patron.
Iranian support for the Houthis is relatively new, however, and it is largely opportunistic. When the Houthi insurgency began 20 years ago and targeted both the Yemeni and Saudi governments, it did not enjoy significant Iranian support. As a sporadic insurgency morphed into a civil war, the Houthis took Sana’a in 2015. They also did this without significant Iranian support, although their success did prompt Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to unleash what he promised would be a quick and decisive strike against them. In practice, this was neither quick nor decisive. The Iranians only started intervening in a serious way in 2017, after the Houthis had independently established both their bona fides and their ability to strike back at the Saudis. That aid has included both ballistic missiles and drones.
For Iran, the Houthis have never been a core interest like Iraq or Syria, or a multi-billion-dollarinvestment like the one Iran has made in Hezbollah. Instead, the Houthis have been a low-cost way to give Iran additional regional reach. They represent a modest investment in regional forces that reject the legitimacy of the status quo. Qassem Soleimani, the former head of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), helped develop the idea of Iran building an “Axis of Resistance” in the Middle East. To a great extent, this wasn’t about extending Iranian control throughout the region. Instead, the idea was that with lesser funds and looser control, Iran could extend its influence everywhere. Because it is easier to destroy than to build, and because it is easier to influence than control, Iran’s strategy was aligned with its constrained resources. As I read it, the message Iran was seeking to send is that if Iran does not feel secure, no one else will feel secure, either.
In this context, consider the Iranians’ and the Houthis’ strategic goals here. The Iranians’ are much more expansive. They are seeking to become a more prominent regional power. To achieve that, they believe the U.S. presence in the region needs to be reduced. Of course, Iran’s regional ambitions persuade regional countries they need the United States to stay. Here we are seeing the Iranian strategy coming into focus.
A large part of Iran’s strategy is increasing hostility to the U.S. regional presence in the region itself. That means both capitalizing on regional hostility to U.S. military support for Israel, and also persuading governments and publics alike that the United States is a wantonly violent and militarily ineffective power that brings chaos rather than stability to the Middle East. Investing in proxy forces that provoke U.S. reprisals is part of this.
Iran has also invested in ensuring that Iraq did not become either a political inspiration for the region or a base from which the United States could project power. It has also invested in relatively modest attacks on U.S. partners that fall below the threshold of eliciting U.S. reprisals, but which are attributable to Iran. This causes many neighbors to question the value of U.S. support, and to find ways to placate Iran. Of course, Iran aligns its messaging criticizing purported U.S. hegemony with both Russia and China, who have their own reasons to increase resistance to the U.S. military presence in the Middle East.
Undermining U.S. domestic support for Middle East deployments is also part of Iran’s strategy. It seeks to draw the United States into a new series of diverse, dispersed, and open-ended military engagements in the Middle East that have no obvious end point or condition of victory. In the wake of the Iraq war and the withdrawal from Afghanistan, Iran is betting that the U.S. public has little appetite for another extended U.S. military engagement in the Middle East.
The Houthis have a somewhat narrower set of ambitions. They are poised to gain increased power in Yemen, and they believe that the Saudi effort to extract itself from an almost nine-year-old war will deliver Saudi aid and recognition. They think that demonstrating their military capabilities, as well as their willingness to strike militarily, enhances their negotiating leverage with Saudi Arabia and increases their value to Iran, their significant external patron.
From a domestic perspective, Yemenis feel genuine sympathy for the Palestinians. The Houthis appearing to take action in solidarity with the Palestinians doesn’t actually help the Palestinians in any way, but it does help the Houthis. It puts the public focus in Yemen on warfighting (where the Houthis are relatively skillful) rather than governance (where they are not). Anti-Houthi protests were escalating in September, and the Houthis had begun large-scale arrests of peaceful protestors. Rallying the public to support their defense of Palestinians moves the discourse to where the Houthis are more comfortable. In addition, presenting themselves as a worthy adversary of the United States enhances their prestige, portraying them as both strong and fearless.
For the United States, the bad options are more numerous than the good ones. In fact, it isn’t clear there are any good ones.
Both Iran and the Houthis are playing a long game. The Iranians want Americans to tire of the Middle East, and they want the region to tire of the United States. The Houthis want everyone to tire of them and just give in. From the perspective of American policy, the Houthis consider our four-year presidential terms to be fleeting, and they are looking at decades of consolidated rule. They feel they can afford to hold on for years, because their expected payoff will last decades. American administrations want to solve problems and move on, often in just a few years. Both are keen to wait out the United States.
Each also benefits from low expectations for success vis-à-vis the United States. Their mere survival is a victory, and if 1 percent of their strikes are successful—such as Iranian-backed forces’ recent attack on Tower 22 in Jordan—they consider it a great achievement.
They are both willing to strike out at any number of soft civilian targets—from commercial shipping to infrastructure—and they attack adversaries who have more to lose than they do. The Houthis in particular have little of value that can be held at risk. They have operated out of makeshift facilities for decades, and they have adjusted to life without sufficient food, running water, and electricity. Almost a decade of Saudi assaults has made them practiced at hiding their assets and moving quickly. They present a very small target space and setting them back is hard. They are expert at requiring their adversaries to use expensive weapons to disable their cheap ones.
It is an understandable impulse to simply use superior intelligence and firepower to push back on Iran and eliminate the Houthi threat decisively. This was the impetus behind Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s decision to attack Yemen in 2015, soon supported by the UAE. Paradoxically, these countries’ assaults failed to push the Houthis from power, but they did significantly deepen Iranian-Houthi cooperation. Having fought the Houthis since then, they are eager for an exit from the war.
Yemen is widely understood to be the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, and because much of Yemen’s humanitarian suffering is in areas under Houthi control, the Houthis exploit their people’s suffering by directing some aid shipments to allies, blocking some from adversaries, and taxing and pilfering from what gets through. The numbers are staggering. Something on the order of 400,000 Yemenis have died during this decade-long civil war. About half of Yemen’s population of 34 million is severely food insecure, and 6 million are on the brink of famine. 5 million children and 1.3 million pregnant and lactating women are expected to require treatment for severe malnutrition this year. 4.5 million people have been displaced. The international humanitarian community remains deeply engaged.
It seems to me that the recent designation of the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group does several useful things. One is to impose penalties on the Houthis while making clear that harsher penalties could be forthcoming. The second is that it allows humanitarian organizations a little more freedom without the worry that any contact with the Houthis—who after all, are the prevailing authorities in much of the country—will result in crippling U.S. penalties.
Despite the despair in Yemen, there has been some progress. A truce that took effect in April 2022 has largely held, providing increased security for civilians. Negotiations between the Saudis, the government of Yemen, and the Houthis have made some progress, although it remains tentative. I hear consistent reports that both the Saudis and the Iranians fear that violence in Yemen could spin out of control and threaten their long-term interests, and they are keen to avoid it.
But the United States faces at least five threats in Yemen. The first is that the United States actually boosts the Houthis when they demonstrate resilience after comprehensive U.S. effort to destroy their capabilities. This plays into a narrative that their mere survival represents a victory. There is little question in my mind that the United States does not have the interest, will, or intention to push the Houthis from power, nor should we. But we may be helping the Houthis present themselves as among the fiercest and most resilient fighters in the Middle East.
The second is that the United States glides down a slippery slope of increased military engagement in Yemen that is divorced from the scale of U.S. interests there. I am not thinking that Yemen will be “our Vietnam”—which, parenthetically, Yemen became for Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt in the 1960s, when he deployed about 70,000 soldiers to Yemen in the 1960s to unsuccessfully put his thumb on the scale of an earlier Yemeni civil war. Instead, I worry that this moment will be part of a long cycle of U.S. engagement in and disengagement from Yemen.
The United States has alternately been deeply involved in counterterrorism and deradicalization efforts, only to shift its focus in a few short years and abandon Yemen to the forces of terrorism and radicalization, before it needs to intervene again. It is no secret that weapons we have supplied to Yemeni forces have been sold around the Middle East and used against U.S. troops in Iraq and elsewhere and have also bolstered the Houthis’ arsenals. It is also no secret that some of the forces fighting the Houthis have their own unsavory history and ties to jihadi groups. When I worked on Capitol Hill in the late 1980s, our support for the Taliban seemed to many to be a masterstroke because it tormented the Soviets in Afghanistan. There is less of a consensus today that our previous support for the Taliban is an experiment we should continue to replicate.
The third danger is that the United States precipitates an even greater humanitarian disaster in Yemen, or is perceived to do so. While the Houthis bear full responsibility for Yemenis’ misery, I could see circumstances in which the United States is accused of instigating the spread of famine and disease in Yemen, with Iran, Russia, China, and some regional media amplifying the message.
The fourth is that it falls into an Iranian trap, sucked into a grinding, open-ended conflict in the region that continues to put U.S. troops at risk without increasing regional security, and which ultimately undermines both the region’s and the American public’s willingness to sustain the U.S. military presence. The costs to Iran of pursuing this strategy are modest, and their timeframe is long. They doubt that we have either the will or the patience to prevail.
The fifth is that the battle in Yemen deepens the rift between the United States and partner militaries. It is both remarkable and worrying that key NATO allies and key regional allies want no public association with any military operations in Yemen, and about half of the 22-member defensive coalition want to do so secretly. While I will leave it to these governments to explain their decision making, no one can consider it sustainable when the United States is one of only a handful of countries willing to fight to defend public goods, and when close partners seek to benefit from U.S. actions without contributing to them. That is, of course, the world that many of our adversaries in the Middle East and around the world would like to see, and I could imagine U.S. military action in Yemen hastening its realization.
The option of striking Iran directly appeals to many, and I accept that the risk of sharp escalation from Iran is modest. While it has threatened to do so, Iran has not exacted retribution for the assassination of former Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani, although several former U.S. officials have enduring U.S. government-provided protection because of credible and persistent Iranian threats against their safety.
Yet, Iran’s strategic response to the Soleimani assassination under President Raisi has proven disappointingly successful. Iran has abandoned efforts to engage the United States, it has deepened its ties with Russia and China, it has improved its relations with its immediate neighbors, and it has enhanced the capabilities of the so-called “Axis of Resistance,” in part by giving these groups greater freedom to pursue their agendas than they had under Soleimani while remaining strategically aligned with Iran. In my assessment, the previous U.S. policy of “maximum pressure” did not work and was not poised to work even if it had more time. Instead, it transformed what was a broad and cooperative international effort against the Iran nuclear program into a bilateral confrontation between Iran and the United States that freed Iran from both constraints and supervision of its nuclear program.
My point is not that we should be soft on Iran, any more than we should be soft on the Houthis. Instead, my point is that in order to deter either one, their leaderships need to feel they has a choice, whereby one pathway provides pain while another provides relief. We are not good at providing such a choice, in part because I strongly suspect that both the Iranian government and the Houthis will be doing things that we find offensive—and that I find offensive—for many years to come. But partly, too we keep thinking that enough pressure or the right kind of pressure will flip our adversaries. In so doing, we miss two important ingredients to our own success: that they must have confidence we will relieve pressure if they behave in the ways we prescribe, and they must not feel that our pressure actually benefits them. That is harder than it seems. In the case of Iran, for example, regime insiders run the smuggling networks that circumvent U.S. sanctions and profit from them. In many cases, they fear the lifting of sanctions more than the imposition of additional ones.
We need to see this conflict as a fundamentally political issue for which we need to use military instruments, rather than a military problem with military solutions. Our goal needs to be to persuade the governments of Iran and the Houthis to make different choices, and not merely seek to defeat them on the battlefield. The Houthis in particular are deeply engaged in negotiations that will determine their future role in Yemen, and the United States has many tools to influence those talks. That, and not the firing of missiles in the Red Sea, will determine their future.
The issue is not that anyone doubts U.S. military capacity. The Iranians and the Houthis enter this battle with the firm knowledge that the U.S. military can destroy any target on the planet. And yet, they also see the U.S. military as an institution that often has struggled to achieve a clean victory over the last three-quarters of a century.
These are forces that feel that their relative weakness and the virtue of their cause justifies breaking the rules of war. They are skilled at using asymmetrical tactics, and they have positioned themselves to portray mere survival as victory. We do not fight that way. But we are overwhelmingly the stronger power, and we have things that each side believes it needs. There is a role for our military strength, but we also must understand that it is only through the other tools of statecraft that we will win."

Cordesman loved to tell stories about wargames, campaign analysis, and other large strategic analysis efforts gone wrong over the last 60 years. One of his favorites was to discuss how difficult it was to calculate relative combat power, including nuclear exchanges, with models that were often based on the weighted unit value (WUV) of individual weapon systems. In other words, can one estimate the power of a nuclear blast as the summation of individual Springfield rifles? He did not think so. Yet this method was common for decades during the Cold War, and Cordesman found the WUV model particularly concerning for how it skewed the ability of analysts to assess military balances and force posture. He loved to grin and say “make WUV not war”—a common reframe of the analytical community at the time. Cordesman knew the value of objectively measuring strategy but was always mindful of the difficulty of quantifying power.
Good strategic analysis boils down to the logic and clarity of its assumptions. It is easy to make bad models, even when some are useful, and easier still to lie with a convenient case study or historical analogy—something he often referred to as analysis reduced to ritual. Cordesman took pride in pointing out these flaws and using them as a point of departure to ask critical policy questions. This trait came from experience. One morning he told me his instincts to challenge assumptions were a byproduct of growing up in Chicago—where politics were never completely straightforward—and from a formative experience working on a team of analysts tasked with cataloguing the end of the Vietnam War.
Net Assessments Don’t Suck
Like many of the greats of his generation, Cordesman did multiple projects with the Office of Net Assessment in the Department of Defense. Over the years, he saw a utility in zooming out to assess macro trends beyond combat power models or narrow facts and figures that tend to get trapped in the noise of the moment. He liked longitudinal and comparative datasets that allowed him to explore how power and influence, often exercised through strategies both good and bad, changed over the course of years, if not decades. He viewed net assessment not as alchemy but more as a form of inquiry that would have been at home in the Annales School of historiography, charting how institutions, states, and entire regional and global systems evolve through interactions over time. For Cordesman net assessments were a way of charting how these larger forces shaped decision-making and the start—not the end—of a public dialogue about strategy. The analyst who tries to assess a military balance without knowing what factors shaped combat effectiveness, and second order, the larger economic and social currents structuring political decisionmaking was bound to simply count tanks.
And Cordesman did not count tanks. Over the years both in and out of government he advocated for net assessment while applying the art to everything from studying China to regional perspectives on the Indian Ocean and the Middle East. He often combined these macro insights with travel and “being there.” I have never met someone who has visited as many war zones as Cordesman. It seemed every other cup of coffee we shared would bring up a memory of walking around the frontline during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s or bad PowerPoint presentations in Afghanistan 20 years later. 
In one of his last net assessments Cordesman wrote, “numbers are no substitute for thought and analyzing all the relevant factors shaping a key trend and comparison, but imagination, politics, ideology, and rhetoric are no substitute for numbers.” This quote captures how best to approach using long-term trends—including good old-fashioned charts and tables—to analyze strategy. A good graph tells a story about change over time and serves as a foundation for thought experiments about identifying possible competitive advantages central to strategic analysis.
Got a Question? Read the Budget
Cordesman was convinced that a major shortcoming of modern strategic analysis was the fact that most people have forgotten—or never learned—how to read a defense budget. He believed that budgets were more important than speeches because they showed the larger trade-offs and tensions behind the scenes in any administration. Budgets showed the imperfections of strategy, often highlighting the gap between the promised theory of victory and a messier reality. Over the years he grew concerned that this gap was widening with budget submissions more often than not reflecting service priorities instead of serving as a blueprint for tying together “plans, programs, and budgets . . . by major mission and strategic goal.”
Honoring Cordesman Means Increasing the Rigor of Public Debates about Strategy
The best way to remember someone is to reflect on the lessons they shared, and the best way to honor them is to embody what made them truly special and extend their major contributions. In honoring Anthony Cordesman, everyone in the defense community should work harder to ensure they add depth and rigor to strategic analysis. Cordesman once told me he came to D.C. as McNamara’s gopher. He was hardworking to the end and never substituted deep insights for a collection of hot takes or sound bites. He did not chase headlines. He looked for deep structural forces shaping hard strategic choices. And most important, he did it all in the public eye, mindful of the importance of an open, vibrant marketplace of ideas that connected free people with elected leaders and serving officials. Hard times call for open debate about strategy.

Alex Kisling: Thanks, Brad. Really appreciate it. And good morning, everybody, and welcome to today’s CSIS press briefing. We have a terrific lineup of experts from across CSIS’s research programs joining us today to offer their latest insights on several critical areas surrounding the war in Ukraine ahead of the two-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion, which we’ll mark just a week or so from now.
Just a couple housekeeping notes before we get started. Each CSIS expert will offer a few minutes of introductory remarks, after which we’ll turn to any questions from those of you joining us today. We’ll also have a transcript of today’s call available by later this afternoon, which will be shared directly with all participants and posted to CSIS.org.
So, with that, why don’t we go ahead and get started? I will turn first to my colleague Seth Jones, CSIS senior vice president, Harold Brown chair, and director of our International Security Program. Seth, over to you.
Seth G. Jones: Thanks, Alex. Really appreciate it. Great to be on this panel.
I’ve got four comments. My remarks are going to primarily focus on the military campaign and a little bit of the Russian military.
As we move into the third year of the war, I would say from a military perspective that Ukraine, which had the initiative last year during its offensive campaign, has lost it. That doesn’t necessarily mean the Russians have it, but I do think it’s fair to say that the – that the Ukrainians have lost the military initiative, at least for the moment. They did not succeed in regaining much territory – a little, but not – certainly not as much as some and even they had hoped. I suspect what we’ll see – we already see a little bit of this in the Luhansk area – is the Russians attempting to seize the military initiative this spring – this year more broadly – and to go on the offense. As I see it, the Russian main effort in terms of the military campaign is likely to center around areas like Luhansk Oblast to capture the remainder of Luhansk, push westward into eastern Kharkiv, and also parts of northern Donetsk. It doesn’t mean it’s unlikely that the Russians will go south and try to retake Kherson. I just don’t see that as being their primary military objective.
Some of the areas that I am definitely watching on an hourly, day-by-day basis are Russian pushes into areas like Avdiivka. There has been a lot of positional fighting near the city over the last few days. Some Russian milbloggers have claimed that Russian forces crossed the rail line in Avdiivka and entrenched themselves in the dacha area west of the railway. But there have been some milbloggers, among others – including Russian ones – that have claimed that these reports so far are unconfirmed. So there’s a little bit of content contestation, but I do think it’s fair to say that we haven’t seen a big change of territorial control.
On the – just briefly, on the – well, actually, I’ll let Eliot talk a little bit more about the Ukrainian military. Let me actually share – to my second major point, which is on kind of the Russian reconstitution. As I look at Russian efforts over the past several months, there is a significant effort to reinvigorate the defense industrial base for a protracted war. And I think it’s reasonable now to expect that Russians now have stockpiles that they would be able to plight for at least another year or two. What’s been interesting, I think – and this – I won’t really talk aid packages because I think a few others are going to talk aid packages – but I think what’s interesting is how much we’re seeing crossing major regional lines, so U.S. intelligence assessments that they have declassified have indicated that the Chinese have ramped up military aid to the Russian – both the military and Russian intelligence services. Examples include navigation equipment for M-17 military helicopters, jamming technology for military vehicles, parts for fighter jets, components for defense systems like the S-400 Surface-to-Air Missile System, semiconductor chips for weapon systems, drones for battlefield use. We’ve also seen some help clearly from the Iranians with the Shahed 136s and the Mojaher 6 drones, including building a drone factory near the Russian town of Yelabuga, and North Korean assistance in providing advanced technology to the Russians, as well – primarily artillery shells and munitions for Moscow’s war in Ukraine. So I certainly think along those line the Russians have the ability to continue to fight for quite some time.
Let me just conclude with a third point on some of the more sort of defeatist comments that I’ve heard, including coming from some senators, about the likelihood of a Russian victory. I think it is way too early to assess the likelihood of victory by either side. I would just point to the repeated examples of small powers wearing down and defeating much larger ones: the Soviets losing in Afghanistan, the French and the U.S. in Vietnam, the U.S. and NATO in Afghanistan, the French in Algeria – plenty of examples where there was, to paraphrase Pakistan’s ISI during the 1980s war in Afghanistan against the Soviets, death by a thousand cuts. And I think in that sense what we see is – what we’ve seen historically is protracted wars where there is significant attrition can change the political calculations and the cost-benefit analysis. So I think if Ukrainians are able to continue to get foreign assistance – the European Taurus would be a good example of what the Ukrainians have been pushing for. If Ukrainians are able to adopt a successful strategy, including heavy focus on drones and air, then I think, you know, there’s a – there’s a reasonable chance that they will make it very painful for the Russians to advance. And we have seen, as I turn to Maria, the Russians not that successful on offense over the course of this war, except for the very early stages.
So, with that, I will hand it over to Maria.
Mr. Kisling: Thanks, Seth. Really appreciate it.
Maria Snegovaya:
 Thank you very much.
Mr. Kisling: Yeah, Maria, I’ll just queue you up here. Maria is our senior fellow with the CSIS Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program. So, Maria, over to you.
Dr. Snegovaya: Hello, everyone. Honored to be here. With apologies, I will have to jump off. I will not be able to stay for Q & A since I’m in the Congress briefing our congressmen on the importance of containing Russia.
So I will cover two topics today, following up on Seth’s excellent comments. First of all, Russia’s ability to circumvent the sanctions; and also Russia’s ability to continue supplying manpower.
So on the sanctions front, unfortunately, news that came out from the last year are awfully negative. As a matter of fact, like, I will cover the oil price cap and export controls as the two main areas on which Western sanctions have focused.
Unfortunately, while the oil price cap did seem to have had an impact on declining Russian revenues in early 2023, by the late 2023 Russia, by investing heavily into refocusing on suppling its maritime oil shipments through shady fleet, almost have been able to, to a large extent, substitute for the oil price cap. By different estimates, it’s about 45 percent of its maritime oil is now covered by shady fleet. With also Russian own fleet, that covers about 70 percent of all Russian maritime oil.
As a result, we’ve seen continuously growing revenues of the Russian budget coming from the oil, that was combined with a relatively favorable oil dynamic. And by now, Russia’s monthly revenues – one year into the oil price cap – actually exceed what Russia used to get before its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Accordingly, Russians used this money to double down on defense spending. In 2024, its investments in defense have increased by almost 70 percent as compared to 2023.
Now, when it comes to export controls, the effort to limit the influx of sensitive technologies into Russia, again, we have seen a fairly similar dynamic where, while at first it took Russia some time to readjust, perhaps, to find new suppliers, it’s huge land border with many countries of Central Asia, the Caucasus, as well as, of course, China, more or less fully substitute for the important Western-produced goods. China’s the biggest factor, especially when it comes to semiconductors. Western-made microchips are the items most often discovered in pretty much every type of Russian military equipment which was investigated by Ukrainian authorities. As a matter of fact, the situation with export control is so dire that, for example, you know – (inaudible) – essentially just points out that export controls are now circumvented left and right, and we really cannot talk any more of them working.
As I mentioned before, China’s role here is particularly prominent. China is very actively substituting for a variety of goods that Russia has lost as a result of the Western-imposed sanctions, from the car industry all the way to consumer goods. But when it comes to technology, China’s role is particularly important. We have seen that Russia’s trade with China in 2023 has reached a record, growing by about 26 percent from 2022.
Now, besides China, Seth has pointed out the important role of North Korea and Iran when it comes to the military. But most importantly, Russia is feeling quite comfortable within the economic dynamics. As we have seen, there’s a lot of Keynesian type of economy, essentially investing into the growth through the investment – through its own state-based investment. And, accordingly, we have seen that Russia also boosting its domestic production and the military industrial complex. Unfortunately, there isn’t a lot of independent data on this matter, so we have to rely on the Russian state-reported data, which is arguably inflated but is not in complete contradiction to what we are seeing on the ground in Ukraine. They are ramping up domestic production of weapons, including tanks, rocket launchers, artillery, and missiles, by more than twofold, and in some instances by more than tenfold. Therefore, it can – one can hardly describe the sanctions as success.
Having said that, we did see Russia’s rainy-day fund grow – steadily erode. There are budget issues, where they are actually struggling to come up with new sources of revenues and likely will be increasing taxes. We have seen inflation rising. Partly that’s the contribution of the sanctions and the fact that Russia now has to resort to the so-called regressive – (inaudible). And in general, there is a general feeling of uncertainty about where things are headed. But it would be – one would be really hard-pressed to describe the sanctions situation as a success, and unfortunately, we will have to do better going forward.
Now, when it comes to the manpower situation, again, Russia displayed a lot of resilience, more than one had expected, given completely unprecedented losses. UK MoD has reported – has estimated that Russia, since the start of the war, has lost about 315,000 troops killed or injured. And with this dynamic, by the end of 2024 it will lose approximately half-a-million people.
So it seems that that huge losses would have had impact on the society, on the morale of the soldiers. However, so far, because it’s the, obviously, among other things, because of the repressions, control of the media, as well as huge influx of the money that Russia is getting for oil revenues and distributing to the families of the injured or killed, and to people – or to so-called volunteers who go to fight in Ukraine, so far, that has actually created a new status quo in Russia which helps it sustain a more or less durable status quo. According to RUSI, for example – (inaudible) – estimated Russian state can sustain the war at least for the next three years. We have seen that the Russian MoD fairly – is fairly consistent in its military tactics, relying on mass infantry attacks, and sends large waves of soldiers against Ukraine in an effort to wear down the Ukraine defense, especially given the shortages in manpower that increasingly happens on the Ukrainian side.
Now, having said that, we do see some early indications of the spreading of fatigue, war fatigue, in the Russian society. For example, we have seen by the end of 2023 some growing – growth in the number of people, of Russian people, in response to the surveys who do support the war – or, sorry, the war negotiations, the war settlement, the peace talks. We have seen them, for example, very supported by – (inaudible) – by the Russians killed; having said that, only under the conditions of Russia holding onto the territories that it’s already occupied in Ukraine. So the numbers right now are about over 50 percent, actually, supporting – defending on the poll you’re looking at. There was this new campaign by Boris Nadezhdin, a politician who wanted to run against Putin, campaigning for end of the war. He also has been able to collect more than 20,000 signatures in order to run in the election, but he wasn’t allowed to run. So there are some spreading signs of the fatigue.
Having said that, so far Russia has been able to fairly successfully maintain an influx of so-called volunteers, promising them high social payments and salaries. Putin in this fall reported that about 300,000 new so-called volunteers volunteered to participate in Ukraine’s war. And RUSI reports that recruiters are achieving about 85 percent of their assigned target for contracting troops for Ukraine war. Therefore, with the current dynamic, unfortunately, it seems that Russia’s not facing serious social resistance to continuing this war, at least for the next year – couple of next years.
And I’ll stop here. Thank you.
Mr. Kisling: Maria, thanks so much. Really appreciate it.
Let’s turn next to Max Bergmann, director of the CSIS Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program and Stuart Center. Max, over to you.
Max Bergmann: Great. Thanks, Alex. And thanks, Maria and Seth and Eliot.
Maybe I’ll just say a little bit about Europe’s response, and then maybe a quick thought on kind of where Ukraine sees itself and the current aid dynamic in Congress.
So I think one of the big surprises over the last two years has actually been the response of the Europeans. Now, two things can be true at the same time, where I think Europe’s response has genuinely surprised, I think, Washington, many in the administration, and I think many in Europe themselves about what they have done and what they – what they are doing; and yet, it’s also at times, you know, not sufficient to actually meet the needs for Ukraine.
I think the one thing when we think about the European response is it’s been far stronger than what we saw after 2014, the EU coming together on sanctions and actually pushing at times the administration to go harder and stronger. We’ve seen major European countries provide major military support for the first time – Germany being, I think, the lead there, where they have not only provided a lot of advanced weaponry but done so at a scale that I think is – has been sort of quite surprising to many, and especially at the beginning of the war given Germany’s history and policy of not providing lethal assistance to a country in conflict. And European will, which, you know, we were all nervous that it was going to crack over the winter of 2022/2023 when energy prices skyrocketed and actual inflation was really tied, I think, to the war in Ukraine and in the explosions of the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines and the cutting off of Russian gas, Europe has adapted and public support has remained really strong despite the economic challenges.
And we’ve seen that recently with the EU coming together and basically getting over the hump with the Hungarian potential veto of 50 billion euros for Ukraine. What’s important to note is that it’s economic aid, not military aid. So the EU is stepping up on the economic side. And I think what we may be seeing in Brussels over the next few weeks, particularly as aid may be stuck in our Congress, is additional assistance packages from the EU. They have something called the European Peace Facility, which in typical EU parlance is actually an EU security assistance fund. That is now out of money, and the question is how much money will be put back into that and whether it’s sort of reformed to now fit the current challenges of the current conflict.
And from a European perspective, the way they support Ukraine military I think, basically, has to – has to evolve and change. I think I sort of identify three phases.
Phase one was the Eastern Europeans giving away all their old Soviet equipment from when they were part of the Warsaw Pact country. Now, those were integrated and used by the Ukrainians at great speed.
Phase two was many Western European countries providing a lot of their old major platforms, Leopard tanks and other things like that.
But now we’re in phase three, where the Europeans are kind of out of stock of a lot of older equipment in their warehouse and it’s now a lot more expensive for them to provide aid to Ukraine in the sense that they would have to provide newer equipment or they have to go and buy that from industries. And the problem in Europe is that they haven’t put things under contract fast enough. They have similar defense industrial issues that we have here and sort of ramping up on that scale. But theirs are – their problems are even more severe because it’s a completely fragmented defense industrial complex and it’s been underinvested in for decades.
The good news there – there’s good news and bad news. The good news is that Europe is ramping up its defense industrial production. European factories are expanding and increasing ammunition production. The EU has provided funding to help finance the expansion of the capacity of defense industries. The challenge is that orders haven’t really come in at the scale that is needed. And part of the issue is that there’s a – there’s kind of a tension between European countries modernizing their own militaries – so investing in NATO capabilities and supporting Ukraine.
For example, Germany announced the Zeitenwende fund, investing a hundred billion. A lot of that money’s going to F-35s, going to advanced helicopters, great equipment that will really improve the German military. That is important for NATO. On the other hand, what Ukraine needs is ammunition and other things that that fund isn’t going to. And so European defense ministries are sort of struggling with they’ve got an increase in funding and how much of – how much of that increase in funding do you use to provide for Ukraine or to now finally modernize your forces. So that’s one of the tensions. And I think, hopefully, there will be some breakthroughs at the EU level.
Just quickly on the state of the war to pick up something I think Seth mentioned earlier about, you know, the – a number of – we’ve seen smaller countries frequently, you know, defeat larger countries in battle, with Vietnam and others being key examples. And I think that’s exactly the right way to view this war. I think Putin – the problem for Russia and the problem for Putin is he has wanted this war in many ways to be treated by the Russian public as a civil war, where this is a war – not a war of choice but an existential conflict for Russia – think our Civil War between North and South, and that once the North sort of fully puts its weight into it with its industrial might and its population advantage, well, the South is – was going to crumble, and that Ukraine will crumble and sort of be reincorporated to Russia. The problem is that he has not won that narrative battle inside of Russia. Calling this a “special military operation” and being concerned about how this is viewed inside of Russia, and by coming up with all sorts of, you know, evolving narratives about this war has meant this is very much a war of conquest by Russia. And that is, obviously, how it’s seen in Ukraine, and I think around much of the world. But I think for most Ukrainians, this is – or, most Russians this is seen somewhat as a war of choice. And while there’s a lot of popular choice for war of choices – we have seen that in the United States – that can really wane, and I think that leads to some constraints on the Kremlin in how they’re going to wage this war.
And so what I’d say is that Ukraine, I think, is at a bit of a pivot point. I think they are at a point where a long war, to me, actually favors them as long as we – that they are continually supported by Europe and the United States in particular. And that is critical, because, while this is utterly sustainable for us economically, maintaining this war economy may not really be sustainable for Russia over the long term and may have – lead to increasing internal challenges.
And so that gets to the assistance funding, where if that funding is passed I have no doubt that Ukraine will be able to completely absorb the Russian offensive that is going on in 2024. In fact, I would be quite optimistic about Ukraine’s potential in 2025 with Russia sort of, in its hubris, launching constant offensives, losing lots of people, and they’re kind of running out of prisoners to throw into the meat grinder so they’re starting to throw people that have more importance or significance from a societal standpoint into the frontlines, that that will really pay a toll on the Russian military, on the Russian war effort, and that in 2025 we’ll have a point where European production will have really ramped up as well. So if U.S. aid continues and European production ramps up, Ukraine will be in a very strong point to, I think, continue this war into 2025.
And this leads to, I think, maybe my final – well, maybe one final thought: Therefore, Congress getting this over the line, the aid funding, is really existential for Ukraine, because if they don’t provide the funding then the war of attrition, the kind of balance goes back to Russia. And I agree with Seth; Russia doesn’t have much offensive combat capacity. But right now, Ukraine is running out of ammunition on the frontlines. They’re having to use more manpower to plug the holes on the frontline. And so the war of attrition really advantages the Russians, and you don’t know when those frontlines may break. We saw in World War I, you know, the Germans in the spring of 1918 were on the outskirts of Paris, and then they lost the war six months later, where their lines just suddenly broke. In a war of attrition, lines can break if the attritted side is depleted enough. So I think that passing the assistance is really critical.
And just one final thought is that right now I’ve seen this narrative on the Hill about, well, maybe it’s time for negotiation. Well, to have negotiations you need both sides. And right now in the Kremlin they think they’re going to win. And if they think they’re going to win, they’re not going to negotiate and they see a real advantage. Negotiations tend to happen when there is a sense of stalemate and that neither side thinks they’re going to be able to win. And we are, I think, a very long way from that happening, and the Russians have to be convinced that they’re not going to win. And to do that essentially requires us to provide assistance and support, and to make clear that that’s not going to stop, then the Russians may view their situation as completely untenable over the longer term and may seek a way out. They’re not going to do that in the near term. And the same applies for Ukraine, in the sense that Ukraine needs to know that they can basically – that they can fight the Russians to the point where the Russia wants the war to end.
So I think that’s where we are. It’s a real pivot point, I think, right now in history about what Congress does. So maybe I’ll leave it at that.
Mr. Kisling: Thanks, Max.
We have a couple of speakers left. Just for those of you who want to ask a question, to add your name to the queue please press one and zero. And then we’ll turn to questions after our speakers wrap here.
Let me turn next to Dr. Eliot Cohen, CSIS Arleigh Burke chair in strategy. Eliott, over to you, please.
Eliot A. Cohen: Great, thank you. So a number of observations. Some pretty much, I would say, supplementing or complementing things that colleagues have pointed out, but some are a little bit different. Let me begin with the first one.
I think it’s easy to fixate on the fact that the lines on land look fairly static. You know, we get a lot of reporting about the battle front, Avdiivka, and so on. And it looks kind of like our mental image of World War One, with a very static trench line. The fact is that there are multiple campaigns going on. And I think it’s important to recognize that fact.
So in fact, just the other day, yesterday, the Ukrainians were able to hit with some of their naval drones a yet another Russian landing ship. This is a pretty substantial ship. I think it’s about 269 feet long. It’s the fifth of nine landing ships that the Russians had in the Black Sea Fleet. So they’ve now sunk more than half of those. Those are actually quite important, because that’s how the Russians – one of the main ways in which the Russians are getting ammunition to the frontlines in southern Ukraine. So there’s a maritime campaign where the Ukrainians have been remarkably successful. They continue to be able to export wheat. It’s not easy, but they’re exporting quite a bit. They’ve pushed a large chunk of Black Sea Fleet off the Crimean Peninsula, as they gradually erode the ability of the Russians to resupply by sea. The Russians are very dependent on the Kerch Bridge. And if they ever get the means to take that out, that’ll be gone.
There’s a deep strike campaign where the Russians have the advantage, but where, frankly, Ukrainian society has, to some extent, I think, become somewhat inured to this. But the Ukrainians are also striking deep in a variety of ways into Russia, with drones, with missiles, but also with a very active sabotage campaign. This has some military consequences, but also has a lot of psychological consequences. And there’s a – there’s an information campaign, on both sides. Which it feels to me a bit more like a draw. You know, the Ukrainians I think clearly had the edge at the beginning, the Russians are, I think, very actively trying to create a narrative of inevitable Ukrainian defeat. Unfortunately, they have some people in Congress are all too willing to believe in that.
Even on land, I think it’s – we got to be careful about how we assess this. My assessment of what the Ukrainians are doing is, in battles like Avdiivka, as with Bakhmut, I think they’ve made a conscious decision to fight for some of these places as way of attritting the Russians. Now, it’s true that, on the one hand, Russians, by a variety of means, are kind of replenishing their manpower. But the point that has to be borne in mind is, you know, this is not a well-trained force. And there’s some elements of it which still are, most of it, though, is very poorly trained. And it’s pretty demoralized. And therefore, not really capable, I think, of large-scale land maneuver. And I do think this is part of the Ukrainian concept.
The other thing I would say is that this is not a static battlefield in another way. Both sides are pouring a lot of effort into the use of advanced technologies. And Seth referenced this earlier. The Russians obviously, in a variety of ways that people have spoken that, are doing this, including with a very active drone program but also with acquisition of technology from Iran and North Korea. But the Ukrainians are very far from sitting still. And in fact, they do have their own industrial strategy in all of this. And they are – they have shown themselves, I think, particularly – I’ll go back to the naval realm – capable of being very ingenious and effective. And really, that was that way throughout the war.
There’ll be new elements entering the battlefield. The Ukrainians are going to get F-16s. They’re not going to be a wonder weapon, but they’re both – they are going to change a little bit, I think, the ability of the Russian Air Force to operate. With luck, they’re going to get some of the weapons systems that would really be helpful to them, particularly the German Taurus and, of course, American ATACMS. So the war is evolving technologically as well, and we shouldn’t – we shouldn’t miss that fact.
The critical question, as a number of my colleagues have pointed out, is, of course, U.S. support, particularly this vote that’ll be coming up in the House. And that’s important, both on very concrete grounds – the Ukrainians are suffering from real shortage, particularly of 155-millimeter artillery ammunition, as well as other things. And this would go a long way to helping them. It’s also psychological. I think it is very important that people don’t think that the United States has lost faith in Ukraine. Although, one has to say that one of the consequences of this debate in the United States has been to spur, I think, increasing European efforts.
The problem, as Max and others have pointed out, is that the Europeans are still behind the power curve in terms of actual military industrial production. The Ukrainian – issues that the Ukrainians face are really three, I think. One is this question simply of resupply there, and shortage of hardware. They have a second big question. That’s a mobilization question. This has been posed sometimes as conscription. That’s not the issue. They have conscription. So the question is, are they going to make more extensive efforts to mobilize the manpower they have, to share the burden more equally, to make sure that units get rotated and so forth? President Zelensky has talked about that. And he particularly talked about that in the context of the change in the command team that he’s put through. And I think that’s a critical domestic, social, and political issue.
And that does bring up the third issue, which is this rather major overhaul of Ukrainian military leadership. The replacement of General Zaluzhny with General Syrskyi. But there is a whole tier of other general officers who’ve been replaced. That tier is actually the more interesting one, in some ways. It is a younger, combat-experienced team. Most of them have worked with Syrskyi himself. He’s actually quite a talented general. There’s a lot of misleading commentary, I think, about the changeover.
You know, generals are heroes in wartime. So everybody loves Zaluzhny. People will love Syrskyi, I’m sure, almost as much. He’s a less charismatic figure in some ways, but he’s certainly highly competent. This is a normal kind of thing that have happen in war. What was interesting to me about that, though, was the instructions that Zelensky gave as he got in this new command team. And I think I think all of us augured pretty well, but he be sure that units get rotated, make sure that the Ukrainians up the level of training, and so forth. So I think that is actually, in many ways, a good sign.
And I just want to address the question of, how could the war end? So my first thought on that one is, if you look at military history most wars, particularly of this magnitude, have to end with the change of leadership on one side or the other. I don’t think either the Ukrainian government or the Russian government, as currently constituted, would be willing to throw in the towel. And so it’ll be the moment when either Zelensky is not in power or Putin is not in power. I think the latter’s a bit more likely than the former. I don’t see the Ukrainians giving up, because this is an existential war for them. It is not an existential war for Russia.
It’s also the case that wars like this often end with a sudden collapse. We need to – in this respect, I think the World War One analogy can be fruitful. Nobody expected the war to end in November 1918. You know, in September, even into early October, people are planning for the campaigns of 1919. And there was not just one collapse, but a set of collapses. I think something similar might happen in this case.
But, you know, my baseline prediction would be this war is going to go on for quite some time. That 2024 is going to be a year when both sides are remodeling their militaries. Hopefully, the Ukrainians are resupplied on the large scale. And I think, unfortunately, there’s going to be quite a bit more fighting to be done before this war ends up resolving itself.
Mr. Kisling: Eliot, thanks so much. Really appreciate it.
Again, if you have a question that you’d like to ask, please press one and then zero. We’ll get to those in just a moment.
But let me turn next to our final speaker, Romina Bandura, who is our senior fellow with the CSIS Project on Prosperity and Development. Romina, over to you.
Romina Bandura: Thank you, Alex. And thank you for – to my CSIS colleagues. I’m going to take another angle in the discussion and address an important aspect of the war, which is the Ukrainian economy. And I’ll make four points. First, Ukraine’s future depends on the outcomes on the battlefield as much as on the economic front. You know, Ukraine is fighting as much a military war against Russia as an economic war. The enemy is trying not only to occupy land, wipe out physical infrastructure, and inflict mass civilian casualties, but also wants to cripple the Ukrainian economy, targeting critical industries.
In this regard, as Max mentioned, the international community needs to continue helping Ukraine keep the lights on. So, you know, this is essential to pay pensioners, teachers, police, which in turn fuels consumption in Ukraine so that, you know, the economy and society did not completely collapse. A staggering indicator is that now more than 24 percent of Ukrainians are now poor and need support. We need a functioning state and a functioning economy in Ukraine. The Ukrainian economy grew by 4.5 percent in last year, in part due to the international support but also thanks to a resilient information technology sector, consumer spending, and Ukraine’s ability to reroute its exports through the Danube and Western borders.
My second point is that budgetary aid for the government of Ukraine is super important to keep the economy running, but the private sector in Ukraine also needs support. A strong business sector is the key to Ukraine’s future. I would say, yes, it’s true that many companies have had to shut down or had their operations halted or interrupted. But many others have proven to be resilient and have adapted to war times. We have to remember that businesses employ people and pay taxes to the government. And a large portion of Ukraine, which is close to 85 percent of the territory, is unoccupied. And this is where businesses can operate and potentially grow.
But companies are having problems finding labor, especially highly skilled labor. Remember that between six and eight million Ukrainians have fled. And companies are reporting that between 10 to 20 percent of their staff has mobilized for the war. Companies are also finding it hard to access affordable credit, fresh capital, and war insurance schemes. Regarding new investments into Ukraine, foreign direct investment, unfortunately, it has collapsed since the war started. Ukraine was able to attract about 500 million (dollars) in new investments, according to the data provided by Ukraine Invest, which is the country’s investment promotion agency. And these investments are taking place in regions that are not under active combat, such as the western and central parts of the country.
I would say that, on the other hand, like, large reconstruction projects that the international community is talking about, mainly in the east and southeast of Ukraine – you know – as you know, these are the regions that have been heavily destroyed or are under active combat. These reconstruction projects will probably have to wait until the war is over.
Third, what can donors do to support, you know, the private sector? Donors through their development finance institutions – what is known as DFIs – could do more to support companies. Only a small portion of the economic aid is being directed to the private sector. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, EBRD, is one of the main institutions that is helping the private sector in Ukraine with commitments of around two billion (dollars). And what we’re hearing is that companies need from these institutions more innovative schemes such as setting up investment funds where donors would provide a first loss tranche to attract other investors; more insurance schemes, maybe for the less-risky areas in Ukraine; more coordination and consolidation of the scattered initiatives that currently these institutions have; and more access to reasonable credit.
My fourth and final point is that Ukraine is also undertaking a lot of governance reforms and combatting corruption, even amid the war. You know, governance and anti-corruption are fundamental steps to attract foreign direct investment and join the EU family in the future.
There was a recent survey that highlights that Ukrainian society considers corruption as the number two problem in the country after the war, but Ukraine has made strong inroads in this regard, including ramping up criminal proceedings against suspected perpetrators, and we’ve seen high-profile cases in the last year. It’s taken judiciary reforms. Ukraine set up a competitive selection process for the heads of the main anti-corruption agencies, and has done improvements in public procurement and others. And due to these changes, the good news is that Ukraine has improved its corruption score. It’s now scoring 36 points out of a hundred in the latest edition of Transparency International Corruption Perception Index. I know this is still very low; it’s half the score of France and 18 points below Poland, but let me point out that it’s very similar to countries like Colombia, which scores 39 out of a hundred, and Mexico scores lower than Ukraine at 31 out of a hundred, and both of these countries – Colombia and Mexico – are part of – are members of the OECD. So combatting corruption is an area where the international community can play a critical role by providing advice and accompanying Ukraine in these reforms. And Ukrainian civil society and independent journalists are important allies in this fight.
So just to conclude on the economy – keeping the economy running is key to Ukraine’s survival. The international community can support this effort through budgetary aid and innovative schemes to help companies continue their operations. I would say that as long as there’s – you know, the security arrangement for Ukraine remains unclear in the – you know, after the war, I would say large-scale investments in Ukraine will probably not materialize any time soon. And I know we’re talking about two years of the full-scale invasion, but I want to remind everybody that it’s actually ten years since Russia occupied Crimea, and so with that I will turn – I’ll thank you, everybody, and I now turn it back to Alex.
Mr. Kisling: Thanks so much, Romina – really appreciate it. And thanks to all of our speakers for their insights this morning.
We have a number of questions in the queue here. Just a reminder: If you want to add your name to the queue, please press one.
But let’s get to some of the questions here. And we’ll start with George Condon from National Journal. George, good morning.
Q: (Off mic) – stepping up.
How has the war affected views of American leadership of the alliance? And is Biden viewed as a leader able to deliver on his promises? And has the current impasse raised European fears of a return of Trump, and all that means for American global leadership?
Mr. Kisling: Thanks, George.
Max, do you want to take a pass at that one?
Mr. Bergmann: Sure.
I think what I would say is that the potential return of Trump is all the Europeans can talk about right now. I think they have viewed the Biden administration essentially as returning America kind of back to kind of its traditional role, as being engaged in leading NATO. I think there’s been some critiques of kind of the slowness of U.S. aid at times.
But I think what has happened over the last year is that Europeans have sort of never – have struggled to doubt that we would provide aid to Ukraine, that they had always believed that we would come through. And in fact, part of the Biden administration’s messaging to Europe over the – since January of last year has been, you know our Congress is divided, but America will be there. We’re unwavering. Secretary of Defense Austin was in Ukraine, you know, late fall, early winter, and said as much, that, you know, we will come through. And Europeans have really grabbed onto that.
And I mean, it’s now dawning on Europe that that may not be the case, and it is causing a real degree of panic. Because I think one of the geniuses of American global leadership has been that we have always – you know, and the administration has sort of always – almost always been in sync with Congress, so that Congress provided the funding for America to do things globally. And you know, it broke down a couple times, Vietnam, but generally, that has been the case. Iraq and Afghanistan, wars were always funded.
And now, we’re in a situation where here’s a war that Europe and the United States are fully invested in, and there’s concern that – whether the U.S. will be there. And it’s coming – I think we haven’t – my concern is that Europe has not been either alive to the fact, or we have been maybe overly reassuring them that we will be able to come through, and hence Europe hasn’t been really geared itself up to take the kind of necessary steps to attempt to fill the gap left by the United States.
So – and I – Trump’s comments over the weekend, President Trump’s comments, were, you know, THE discussion point in Europe. And I think there’s tremendous concern about what this means because, let’s be clear, Europe is dependent on the United States for its security. And as much as we complain about that, and want the Europeans to spend more, that is how NATO is structured. NATO is structured that Europe goes to the United States, and the U.S. military will lead the effort to defend Europe. That is how we have wanted it. That is what we have told the Europeans, that’s how they structured their militaries, around us, around NATO. And even if they all spend 2 percent, that will – they will still be dependent on us. And that is the freakout concern, is that somehow if we pull back there – you know, there’s no real ability for the Europeans to coordinate their military efforts without us. And that’s how we have wanted it, and now there’s concern that we are going to be pulling back.
Mr. Kisling: Thanks, Max.
And I actually have a related question here from Aamer Madhani from Associated Press, who unfortunately had to drop. But he posed this, and so maybe, Max, you can address, and, Seth/Eliot/Romina, feel free to jump in.
But essentially the question is, you know, if an aid package is passed here in 2024, will that really essentially be it? But how can the U.S. possibly keep up aid for Ukraine in the current political environment for a war that, you know, many on this call have even suggested that, you know, shows no end in sight? So, Max, I don’t know if you want to address that. And Seth and Eliot, Romina, please feel free to weigh in if you have any thoughts on that as well.
Mr. Bergmann: Yeah. I guess my quick thought is I’ve heard that and I don’t think that’s necessarily true. I think that I – who knows, well, if – I think it’s hard to see a second Trump administration pushing forward for more aid. That said, I think a second Biden administration would. And after an election in which President Biden would be successfully elected, I don’t know where the Republican Party will be. And I think what’s pretty clear is that I think still the majority of Republicans – maybe they’re not going to vote this way – support Ukraine. So I don’t think that this would be the end of the road for Ukraine assistance. I don’t think this has to be the end of the road. So I could be optimistic about continued U.S. support.
The thing I would say is that European production, hopefully, is a ramped up in 2025. As Seth said, if we aren’t able to provide aid, at least the aid that we provide now would be the bridge to transition this to more of a European effort.
Dr. Cohen: I mean, I think I would just add to that that, you know, we have lived through so many circumstances where people have said this can’t go on or, you know, they’re absolutely certain that things will turn out in a particular way.
This is just an incredibly fluid environment. You know, it’s not even inconceivable to me that if Trump were elected, you know, if he’s flattered the right way we could easily end up sending arms to Ukraine.
But I think on balance, you know, the – objectively the American security interest in a free Ukraine is enormous. It has tremendous repercussions for how we are viewed in Asia and, indeed, around the world. It is, from the point of view of our defense budget, a trivial amount of money for a very important outcome, which is the destruction of the Russian military.
So the basic arguments are going to remain intact. As for where the Republican Party goes, you know, I think God only knows and I wouldn’t – I really wouldn’t try to predict. But I do think that we have to accept the fact that there’s a reemergence of isolationist sentiments in the United States on a scale which we really haven’t seen since the ’30s and early ’40s and that’s – it’s very concerning.
But I don’t think it’s in any way a given that those instincts and inclinations will triumph.
Dr. Jones: Let me just add briefly – this is Seth – a couple of additions, and I strongly agree with the way Eliot just characterized the importance of this.
But I think it’s certainly possible that the U.S. does pass the aid package. I think there’s no question it’s become more difficult politically to do that, at least in this environment. But, you know, Germany is considering long-range Taurus missiles. I think there is a lot of concern about the future of Russian activity. We could certainly see countries on NATO’s eastern flank like Poland, for example, continue to provide assistance to Ukraine and use their territory to do that.
I’ve been pleasantly surprised to see South Koreans and the Japanese stepping up and providing either directly or indirectly weapon systems including indirectly South Korean tanks to Poland, which has allowed Poland to provide some assistance.
The U.S. could also provide assistance to Ukraine in other indirect ways, selling various weapon systems to European countries that allow them to then take older models and give them to the Ukrainians. There are questions about using frozen Russian assets which, you know, there’s some debate about.
And then it’s just worth noting that the U.S. support to the Afghan mujaheddin in the 1980s was not a Title 10 operation for the most part. It was (entitled ?) 51; it was done as a covert action program.
There would be options that the U.S. could provide covert assistance that would not necessarily require the same type of assistance that the U.S. has provided today – you know, large chunks of money that Congress has to approve but done through Title 50 needs. Thanks.
Mr. Kisling: Seth, thanks. And thanks, Eliot and Max.
We’re about to hit the hour here, but we do have a couple of final questions in the queue. So maybe we can quickly go through those.
Howard from Christian Science Monitor, why don’t you go ahead? Good morning.
Q: Good morning. Thank you all for doing this.
I wanted to ask – there was some discussion of Russia’s efforts to build up its defense production, its military industrial production, and – but I’m wondering if you can talk a little bit about Ukraine and how successful Ukraine is at that, kind of where that stands. And in particular, what I think I remember seeing was something about Ukraine shifting its space industry, which has been, you know, kind of a stellar international space program, but sort of transitioning that into defense production.
And then, secondly, there was also discussion of the Black Sea. I was glad; that was going to be my other question. But in particular on that, you know, over the past couple of years, always as we get around to summer there’s a focus on food and wheat exports. And I’m wondering if there’s any sense of prospects of this year for the food and in particular wheat exports. Thanks.
Dr. Cohen: Eliot here. Let me jump in on those.
I think one thing to remember about Ukraine is that when it was part of the Soviet Union it was really a piece of the advanced industrial infrastructure of the country, including in aerospace. They also have a – have had historically a very strong software and information technology industry. Now, that – all that doesn’t translate into the ability to, you know, manufacture large numbers of modern tanks or things like that, but they have been able to do a pretty remarkable job of producing some quite sophisticated long-range cruise missiles like the one that destroyed the cruiser Moskva, these underwater drones, the way they have been able to develop their own drone industry and to operate it in quite sophisticated ways with homegrown software. And so they’re clearly putting a lot of effort into this.
It remains somewhat opaque, and I think that’s entirely by intention and it’s entirely appropriate. I mean, the one problem that you have is the country is fundamentally within range of Russian missile attacks. And so there have – there has been talk of having some of the – some Ukrainian facilities outside the country, and I think you’ll see more of that. But it’s quite clear that the – you know, the Ukrainians do have a very energetic leader in their – I think it’s the Ministry for Strategic Industries, Mr. Kamyshin, who was the guy who I believe had been running their railroad system very, very effectively as well. So there’s a lot of energy and dynamism in that. It’s going to pay off in a variety of ways.
But at the end of the day, they still absolutely need particularly heavy military equipment and very sophisticated long-range ballistic missiles and things like that. They’re going to be dependent on external supply.
I think, you know, the basic news on the Black Sea is they have been continuing to export grain and they will continue to do so. It is quite remarkable how the Black Sea Fleet has been driven back. And if you go – if you think back to where we were two years ago, where there was an expectation that you were going to have Russian marines landing and seizing Odesa, we’re a very, very far cry from that. Now, the Russians are going to continue to attack ports with cruise and ballistic missiles. They will continue to deploy mines, although that – you know, there are some issues associated with that in terms of how other Black Sea powers, particularly Turkey, feel about that; the same thing with submarine warfare. But on the whole, this is something that the Ukrainians have been able to sustain, and that’s – it’s quite a remarkable achievement. And people – we tend to be very land-focused. It’s important to think about the war at sea as well, because it’s really – it is very important in a number of ways for Ukraine.
Dr. Jones: Just to add briefly onto Eliot’s comments, particularly on – and, Howard, great to hear from you. This is Seth.
The key parts of the industrial base – despite recent meetings in Washington with the U.S. Department of Defense, Commerce, State, and Ukraine’s industrial base, key parts of that are going to just take a long time. I mean, it’s long enough if the U.S. – you know, for the U.S. to jumpstart its medium- and long-range munitions. You know, all of our sophisticated systems there are at least a two-year production phase. So to start not entirely from scratch, but to really build some of those domestic capabilities is – it’s a long process. I think, as Eliott notes, there are some areas where, you know, this sort of MacGyver-like – to highlight the former TV character – entrepreneurship of Ukrainians, where they’ve really been able to advance, and I think where they do have some domestic capabilities, is on uncrewed or unmanned systems.
And a lot of the technology – the Palantirs and Andurils that have provided assistance to the Ukrainians on the technology side, including software, the Ukrainians are pretty good now at key parts of what in the defense world we call the kill chain. And that’s the sensor nodes, the movement of intelligence quickly. That could be from a forward-deployed drone back to artillery. They’re pretty good at that. So there are key parts of that what I’ll call kill chain that Ukrainians are domestically, I think, able to do. Some of the bigger and longer-range ammunition, or missiles, or air defense system, that’s just – that’s just a long – that’s a long time horizon. That’s long for the U.S. to do it in its own industry.
Mr. Kisling: Seth, thanks.
I know we’re over time here, but we have one final question. Jordan Davis from Swiss Broadcasting. Jordan’s been waiting patiently. So, Jordan, why don’t we go to your question? We’ll address it, and then we’ll wrap the call.
Jordan, please.
Q: Hi. Thanks for taking my question.
You touched on it just a few minutes ago, about sort of what the other possible options were for the United States if there’s no congressional authorization for Ukraine weapons and, you know, one of them the exporting to other allies who would then in turn send weapons to Ukraine. And I was wondering how – what the potential for that is? And, yeah, how if that – I mean, obviously, I don’t think that could replace the congressional authorization. But what is the potential for that to help Ukraine?
Mr. Bergmann: Yes. This is Max. I think there is – there is real potential. The broader issue is Europeans have run out – they don’t have the stockpiles that we have. And then there are certain countries, like France for instance, that have a serious military and they’re not going to be willing to go below certain thresholds, just like the Pentagon’s not going to be willing to go below a certain threshold. I could see a situation in an emergency where perhaps they go lower, but only if there’s adequate funding that then is allocated to ramp up production, and they have a degree of certainty.
So there is a sort of tension between the broader readiness of certain European forces and their ability in the immediate term to backfill. Over, I think, the longer term, in terms of providing weapons and selling weapons to Ukraine, I think there’s a lot more potential there. Now, obviously, they’re still not going to have the same industrial capacity that we have. But, you know, Europe is 450 million people. It has lots of resources. And they have a very diverse defense industrial base. So I think there is real potential there.
I’m a little bit more skeptical when I hear about U.S. defense companies going into, like, Eastern Europe to then build equipment for Ukraine. I think there’s potential there, but we have, in general, a challenge of allocating funding to – you know, in Congress – that would go – that wouldn’t be spent for jobs in America. So I think that’s our fundamental challenge. I think there’s this big question for the Eastern European defense industrial base that a lot of it has been geared to sort of focus on old Soviet equipment and repairing sort of Soviet tanks and things like that, and keeping those in service. And they have a lot of spare defense industrial capacity now because all that equipment is gone.
So they have to retool. And there’s a challenge, just like anything with European defenses, that none of these countries or companies are really working together. And I think there’s a lot of uncertainty about where this defense industrial capacity would go. Some of – the EU is sort of trying to address that. That’s part of been the 155 ASAP initiative by the EU, linking some of the Western European companies with Eastern European companies. So there’s a lot happening in this space, I think, in Europe. But it is one that they – what’s certainly needed is funding, I think, to supercharge it all.
Dr. Jones: This this is Seth. Let me just add two kinds of examples. And, you know, this is – these are really meant to be examples rather than comprehensive. But the U.S. continues to export some of its more advanced fighter aircraft to a range of European states, like its F-35s. And that certainly could continue to allow some of those European states to export F-16s to Ukraine. And that’s already started, from Denmark and Netherlands. So, you know, one area to look at is the export of fixed-wing aircraft or even helicopters.
Second is tanks. General Dynamics has been pretty active in working with countries like Poland, discussions with Finland, about exporting Abrams to Europe, particularly to some of the frontline eastern flank states. So that leaves open the possibility of additional Abram supplies that provide a little bit of opportunity for, whether it’s the Poles or others, to export some land-based systems into Ukraine. So those are active discussions. And I think, you know, F-35s is obviously Lockheed, Abrams is General Dynamics, but these are the European – U.S.-European – exports to Europe that might provide some opportunities. And again, we’ve already seen that with that F-16s.
Mr. Kisling: All right, Seth, thank you very much. And to Max, thank you. And thanks to Eliot and Romina and Maria for all of their comments today. And thanks to all of our participants for a great discussion.
So we’ll leave it there. As I noted at the top of the call, we will have a transcript available of this call in a few hours, which we’ll share with everybody and post to CSIS.org. But, of course, we’re always happy to be a resource for your coverage. Don’t hesitate to reach out to the CSIS Press Office as you continue your coverage in leading up to the anniversary here. So with that, thank you all for joining us and enjoy the rest of your day.

Watch the full video here. Panel 1: Situating Hostage Diplomacy as an International Security Threat
Jon B. Alterman: Good afternoon and thank you all for coming. I want to start by thanking Global Affairs Canada, the State Department, and the Woodrow Wilson Center for supporting this event and for being partners all along. I also have to say, it is always such a pleasure for me to see my friends Haleh Esfandiari, Siamak Namazi, both of whom were very good friends before their time in Evin Prison. And every time I see them free, it is deeply meaningful to me. I’m also happy to see my friend Jason Rezaian. Jason and I are the co-executive directors of the CSIS's bipartisan Commission on Hostage Taking and Wrongful Detention. Many of our commissioners are in the room. Others are watching online. Very difficult and important work. But I think the most important work I can be doing. And I'm grateful for their partnership. Jason, as I said, was in Evin prison for 544 days. I'm tired of having friends who have been in Evin Prison. This really has to stop.
We have a remarkable panel to discuss this issue from a security perspective. First, we have Jennifer Daskal. She's deputy homeland security advisor and deputy assistant to the president. She's had a number of administration positions. And before that, worked as a professor of law at American University. My friend Dani Gilbert is an assistant professor of political science at Northwestern and a member of our bipartisan hostage commission. She previously taught at the Air Force Academy and worked for four years on Capitol Hill. Rachel Briggs is co-founder and CEO of Clarity Factory, a consultancy that works with the private sector, governments, foundations, and nonprofits. She is the founding executive director of Hostage US and the first director of Hostage UK, which works to support the families of hostages and wrongly detained individuals. She was awarded an Order of the British Empire (OBE) ten years ago for services to hostages and their families. Finally, Professor John Packer is the Neuberger-Jesin professor of international conflict resolution at the University of Ottawa. He's worked extensively with the United Nations (UN) and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) on issues related to peace processes, political transitions, conflict prevention and resolution, and human rights. What a great panel.
And, you know, I think the way to start is just to start with the practical issues. Jen works these issues every day. Tell me, what's been the administration's approach to wrongful detention, and what tools do you have to respond to the actions? As the Secretary, and the Minister said, our adversaries aren't playing by the rules and are using American citizens and citizens of other countries as pawns.
Jennifer Daskal: Thanks, Jon, and thanks for the introduction and thanks to the Wilson Center, CSIS, the State Department, especially the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs (SPEHA), and the entire team in Canada as well for hosting this really important set of discussions. They're critical. As deputy homeland security advisor, I've had the opportunity to meet with families who have a loved one unjustly detained abroad. And I can tell you that it is President Biden's priority, truly, since day one, to be able to tell each and every one of those families that your loved one is coming home. And over the past three years, as you heard Secretary Blinken discuss, we've made enormous progress towards that goal. We brought more than 60 fellow Americans home from countries all around the world, including Russia, Venezuela, Burma, Afghanistan, Haiti, Rwanda, West Africa, and more. This includes the 45 wrongfully detained individuals that Secretary Blinken mentioned, plus hostages and individuals who have been kidnapped for ransom. And we're not stopping there. Our entire team up to the president is working constantly to try to secure the release of all of our fellow Americans who remain captive around the world.
Now, all of you know that what is required to achieve that varies by case. Recovering a hostage from terrorists demands a different set of tactics and tools than negotiating the release of a wrongfully detained American who's being held by a nation-state. And we’ve also taken some very important steps to try to prevent and protect against this, Jon, as you asked about from the beginning. First, President Biden signed an executive order to strengthen the consequences applied against perpetrators who use Americans as pawns. This means more collaboration across the government, and as part of this effort, we announced last year the first ever sanctions against those actors who were engaged in this heinous practice of taking Americans and detaining them wrongfully. As you heard Secretary Blinken discuss, we've worked robustly with international partners on preventing wrongful detentions in the first place. We are among 74 other nations that have signed the Declaration Against Arbitrary Detention and work together to mount collective pressure against the states that engage in this terrible practice. And third, we are taking steps to make sure Americans know not to travel to those kinds of countries that engage in this kind of practice. The State Department launched a new indicator called the “D indicator” for “Do Not Travel,” which warns Americans if there's a high threat of detention in the country which they plan to visit. And that should serve as a warning not to go to that country.
And finally, we're doing more than ever to support families from the moment we learn that their loved one has been detained or taken hostage. We work to keep them informed. We do this as an inter-agency, SPEHA plays a huge role in this. We connect them to support systems. We ask for their feedback and much, much more. This is critical to be able to provide support to the families and help support them as they're going through this incredibly painful process. So, thank you. Thanks for hosting this panel. Thanks for the opportunity to be here. I look forward to the discussion.
Dr. Alterman: Thank you very much for that. And thank you for coming. I'm sure it's an absolutely crazy schedule in the White House, and I'm grateful that you made time for us. Dani, you've thought rigorously about this as a political scientist. This is a phenomenon of statecraft. How can you help us think about this phenomenon of states using hostage taking as a national security strategy? How do we think about dividing state and non-state actors? Help us wrap our heads intellectually about what's going on here.
Danielle Gilbert: Well, thank you so much, Jon, and thank you to the Wilson Center and all the co-hosts for having me here today. So, as we've heard from all our speakers so far, what we're talking about here today—whether we call it arbitrary detention or wrongful detention or hostage diplomacy—there is a large set of issues that we're talking about. There are legal problems, there are human rights problems, and this is a security problem as well. So, at its basic distillation, hostage taking is conditional detention. It's taking and holding a human captive to coerce someone else to change their behavior. And hostage taking is an ancient crime. It's been around since the earliest written records of war. And over that time, it has shifted from a tactic of states to a tactic of non-state actors. And over the last decade, we've really seen it emerge as a tactic of hostile, autocratic state actors once again. In that time we've seen a wide range of hostage-taking tactics as well from kidnappings to hijackings, to barricade incidents and, in the last decade or so, this phenomenon of wrongful detention, in which states use their criminal justice system to take foreigners hostage. I think of this, in effect, as a form of hostage taking carried out under the color and guise of law, and it specifically targets, usually, democratic countries who are extremely vulnerable to this form of hostage taking for several reasons.
First, democracies like Canada and the United States care deeply about the international rule of law and about reciprocity, about an understanding that law means something, that our word means something and that we won't treat people arbitrarily in the international system. Democracies are also vulnerable because of our values. Governments in democracies care about the health and safety and well-being of their citizens, whether they are at home or abroad. And so, they're deeply affected when their citizens are held unjustly and reprehensibly in this way. In democracies, there's also electoral accountability. Leaders feel pressure from their publics who really can't tolerate seeing this kind of detention ongoing. In my opinion, we should think of wrongful detention as a specific type of hostage taking, because it uses that conditionality, that threat of continuing to hold someone captive in order to coerce a wide range of concessions from government adversaries.
There are a few ways in which it's meaningfully different from some of the other forms of hostage taking that have been most prominent over the last 50 or 60 years. Things like hijacking or kidnapping are different from hostage diplomacy in meaningful ways. One way that it's different is that when someone is kidnapped or hijacked, we might be worried that the hostage will lose their life in captivity. Typically, in wrongful detention, it’s about time. It's about losing meaningful portions of a person's life. It's the threat, not necessarily of killing the prisoner, but of holding them for years and years and years. In hostage diplomacy, in wrongful detention, there's a return address. We know where prisoners are being held. Maybe they're able to speak to their family or speak to a lawyer, but that doesn't mean that they're coming home any faster. In fact, sometimes it means they can be held for much longer periods of time. There's a very different set of responses that governments can use to bring home those who have been wrongfully detained versus those who are kidnapped by non-state actors. Rescue missions are a potential option for hostages held by non-state actors, whereas a much wider range of concessions are, frankly, on the table when we're talking about state perpetrators.
I'll end by talking about a couple of trends that we've seen in the last decade as wrongful detention and hostage diplomacy have been on the rise. So, we know that there are many more cases of this than we used to see. And that might be because we have named it. We're starting to count it. We have events like this that we are bringing attention to it. But frankly, I see it as just the latest form of hostage taking which actors will adopt because they know it works against their stronger democratic adversaries. And we also see it on the rise as a shift from the global war on terror, from insurgencies that frequently use kidnappings to a return of strategic competition, where most of the security focus in the international realm is state-to-state competition. The targets of hostage diplomacy are typically people who have an extraordinary amount of experience in the countries where they are being held captive. They work there. They might live there. They have families there. They might be dual nationals. Journalists, aid workers, NGOs, people who should be off limits for this kind of behavior. And finally, while there is an established collection of autocratic perpetrators who are using this tactic similarly, they seem to want different sets of things from their hostage taking actions. Some are interested in one-on-one prisoner swaps, whereas some other countries, like Iran, typically seem to be coercing a wider set of concessions as part of geopolitical deals.
Dr. Alterman: Thank you, Dani. It's a lot to think about. I think a lot of very helpful framing. And you gave us a sense for the motivation of the guys doing this. When Rachel and I were having a conversation last week, she pointed out this is basically about states breaking rules. Let’s talk about the states that follow the rules. What's your sense about the direction that states can and should be taking to enforce rules against states that don't want to obey or abide by the rules?
Rachel Briggs: Thank you for having me. And I'll, perhaps before I jump straight into that, I just wanted to emphasize how important the framing of today's event is. For those of us who have been working on these issues for 10, 15, 20 years, we started to see these cases emerge bit by bit. There was one in Iran. Something funny was going on in China. Somebody seemed to be caught up in Russia for no good reason. We started to see this trend emerging, somewhat the canary in the coal mine. And over time, as Dani said, we've started to name this thing and we've started to see it emerging and we understand it now as a trend.
But I think it's really important that we do see this as the thin end of a much bigger wedge. This is a group of countries who are using arbitrary detention, and they're also using a heck of a lot of other tools in their toolbox that they shouldn't be using to be aggressive, to behave in a way to push buttons and to get their own way. And so it's very important that we frame this in this broader context. It is not just about finding ways to bring home people who were arrested, seized for no other good reason than the color of their passport. And that comes from somebody who's dedicated the last 20 years to working on that issue. Getting people home is critically important, the most important objective here. But we mustn't lose sight of the fact that this is just one of the tools in the toolbox of a group of countries who have decided, “To heck with the international rule of law. To heck with the rules that everybody else abides by. We're going to do things differently.” That has to frame how we respond to this. And what it means is that our responses have to be the following: they've got to be very serious, they've got to be absolutely sustained, they've got to be incredibly well-resourced, they've got to be very creative. We've got to do some creative stuff here because we are dealing with people who are being very creative around the rules. And finally, they've got to be courageous. We've got to get really comfortable with being uncomfortable in the way that we deal with these issues. We must not get into our safe space, our cozy space. We've got to get really courageous and really uncomfortable and really creative.
And to answer your question, Jon, what can we do? There's two things that I wanted to highlight. Perhaps some of the stuff might come up in conversation. I wanted to start with the importance of getting ourselves coordinated. And let me start within the national sphere. I had the pleasure of living in the United States for five years, 2015 to 2020, as I was setting up and running Hostage US, and handed it off now to my incredible, former coworker Liz Cathcart, and what I saw during that period was a 180-degree turn around within the US government. I mean, pretty extraordinary.
And I cannot emphasize enough the importance of having that Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs. Somebody who is able to have a singular focus and one agenda item, and it's always the same item. And in these issues of course there’s bilateral concerns. “This trade deal is this or that.” Of course. Let's be honest and grown up about this. There are always competing demands around that table. So having somebody who's only got one agenda item and they're just going to keep repeating it over and over again is incredibly important. And it gets this the attention that it deserves. It also has done an extraordinary job of building up expertise. And while it is true to say that each case has its uniqueness, there is a trend here. And having an office, having a collective place where all of that institutional memory comes so it doesn't get lost when somebody gets rotated out of the job. What we learn in Iran doesn't get lost in how we're dealing with Russia and vice versa, although there are there are differences. We centralize our knowledge. Together, there's a continuity. And you have a team of people who are able to see, recognize, and communicate the reality, which is there are trends across cases, country and time. And it's really important that we don't lose that knowledge.
The two things that I wanted to point out as being really special features of that particular institutional arrangement is the following: one is pitching it at the right level. You have to have somebody in that role who has the ear of every single decision-maker they need to reach. So seniority matters, I'm afraid, you've got to have influence. You've got to have the ability to get in the door and get around the table and be heard. And the second thing that's really important, and I really applaud the way that Ambassador Carstens has gone about this, because this wasn't a given, is bringing together a team of all the talents. I have to say, it's one of the things I really tip my hat to you Americans about, because your willingness to bring around the table yourselves, of course, businesspeople, journalists, NGOs, former hostages, their families, anybody who influences diaspora communities. And I think having that attitude, which is: this is a very complicated problem, we need to get everybody around the table who's got a sliver of expertise or influence that they might bring to bear to make the impossible happen. That team of all the talents is incredibly important.
To close this, I should note as well that I know a number of other countries are now following the model that we have in the United States. It's something I've called on for years now, and I'm so thankful to see that this is happening. I can't understand why any country that is touched by this problem would not have that institutional arrangement. And then secondly, on a very practical level, we heard from our politicians earlier in the event about the importance of this coalition of working together internationally. Great job in bringing together all those countries. I mean, it's a coalition, it’s an extraordinary collection of countries standing united against this. And it's time to operationalize things. It's time to not just say, how do we, as one country, get our house in order and be as efficient and productive as humanly possible? It's about then saying when things are happening operationally around the world, how do we as Americans, as Canadians, as Brits, as French, as Germans, as Japanese, how do we come together as a team? Of course, we've got our own interests. But what does it mean when I, as a Brit, make a certain decision? What does that mean for that person that you're trying to get out? And in the same circumstance, how can we share information? How can we tag-team? How can we try and do a deal together? How can we not just be really efficient and productive ourselves as countries, but how can we bring that same ethos and that same team of all the talents together? Every single time this happens to one of us, it happens to all of us.
I hope that if anything positive can come out of the truly dreadful events in Gaza and those poor hostages whom we are still trying to come home, I hope that maybe it is in a time-limited, highly pressured situation that governments have, whether they feel forced to do so or whether they have willingly done that, they have absolutely realized the power of operationally coming together in real-time. Tag-teaming. If it happens to one, it happens to all. And so I hope we can see that concept so beautifully personified through the office of the SPEHA maybe becoming something that becomes operationalized in individual cases, internationally as well.
Dr. Alterman: Thank you. Rachel. John, you have served in an alphabet soup of international organizations and institutions, and you've thought deeply about how international relations work in a practical way. I was wondering first if you could address the issue that Rachel sort of highlighted about international cooperation. Where should we institutionalize it? Where should we do it? Is it important that it's sort of tied to an institution or several institutions?
I think the other piece is when you have countries that are breaking the rules, they decide to break the rules. What does that mean about how the international community is working? Is there a community? And if there's not, what do we do about that?
John Packer: Thank you very much. First, thank you for the invitation to join this important conversation, and thank you for the opportunity to share some views. I have to say that my observation is that it's not good out there. The trends fundamentally are not conducive. It is a valid question. Is there an international community? This is a phrase we use. I would suggest there isn't. There are communities. One of the features of the world in which we live is increasingly complex inter and non-interdependencies. We see, for example, separations and increasing divisions. I'm not so encouraged, I'm sorry to say, by the 70 or so countries that have signed up to the Declaration that Canada initiated, because I know, and we should all know, that the basic prohibition of arbitrary detention is well-established already from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. I mean, the normative side is well-established, almost universally agreed.
And it kind of begs the question, where are the other 120 countries that are hesitating to sign on to this, right? And I think the answer is because they're not really sold on it anymore. I mean, we've just seen Russia pulling out not only of the Council of Europe but now out of specific instruments like the Framework Convention of the Protection of National Minorities, giving up on the Moscow Mechanism in the OSCE and so forth and so on. So, we have to count as a fact here that the world is messy. And as a former boss of mine once told me, he said, ""We don't only have friends,” which is to say, “We increasingly have enemies.” There are those who are opposed. There are actors who are not acting in good faith. They're acting in positively bad faith. There are those who are profiting from the instability and the deterioration. They are sowing the seeds, and they are utilizing exactly these fissures, fractures, they want them to be fissures in the international system. This is obviously problematic.
I would go a step further to say a feature I can disclose to you that I also sit on the board of Human Rights Watch Canada, and the methodology of many human rights organizations has been based on this idea of mobilizing shame. If we would reveal, expose, and so forth. We're living in a shameless world. So that thesis or the theory of change is not very useful or instrumental. If we talk about operationalizing, we have to rethink how do you operationalize in a situation where you're actually dealing with bad actors in terms of their intentions, in their faith? So, how to do this? I'm not so sold. I mean, I worked for almost ten years in the OSCE, I was the legal advisor for the Director of the Office of the High Commission on National Minorities still a lot of a tailored institution that has a little lesson from it, because when that institution was created in 1992, in a second Helsinki Summit after the Cold War, they carefully circumscribed the mandate and they said it's not for national minorities. It was on situations affecting relations between states, and then they precluded actually acting on individual cases, interestingly enough, to kind of engage in these problematical situations.
The reason I say that is because I think it's very important to make qualitative distinctions here. I first was involved, with just one sentence on this, with hostage taking in Iraq in the early 1990s. I was assistant to the first UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Iraq, and went to Abu Ghraib prison. And there was a guy, a Brit, who had bicycled into northern Iraq, oblivious to the situation in the world. The Iraqis put him in jail, Abu Ghraib, and slapped a 20-year sentence on him and instrumentalized him. They wouldn’t have cared too much before, they would get the guy out, some penalty. They instrumentalized him for inter-state relations. That's a very different thing than when I worked in Yemen, and they were Americans taken hostage by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula who were either doing it for money or for local political reasons. That’s simply a different qualitative matter, and I think we need to make that distinction, which Professor Gilbert has written about.
How do we do this? I'm not sure that a kind of universalist approach, at this moment in time, is going to be effective. The list of the, if I may say, bad actors is growing. Read Freedom House reports, 20 years of diminished democracies and so forth. So I think we have to really look at tailoring how we respond, not only with those actors who are going to understand what is problematical about this for real international relations, even bad actors have interests in real international relations.
And the second element in that is not only what the norm element would be, but I think we have to think about what are effective recourses.
At the moment it's not clear to me where you go with this kind of problem, except specific domestic institutions, such as here. Is there someplace to go? That could be early, the preventive argument could be effective. There are certain means of quiet. I'm not sure that we need to legalize this, but we need to have some kind of investment in it. I think we probably, for all of this, need some more, tailored and specific research about the kinds of cases, what exactly is happening, what works where and why. And I'm not sure that we have that at the moment.
Dr. Alterman: Thank you. Jen, one of the themes here is the bad guys are learning. So, what have we learned works? And how do we keep a step ahead of the bad guys?
Ms. Daskal: Thanks. I strongly agree with the end of of the last statement, which is that the cases are not the same, the cases are different. And one of the reasons why I think it takes so long sometimes to figure out these cases is because the actors on the other side are different. They have different interests, they have different personalities, they have different strategic interests. And in each and every case, we are in a position of trying to figure out what the position is of the other side and come to a resolution where in the particular interests of getting our Americans home, we can achieve that. So I think there's not a single answer to the problem of bringing Americans home or bringing any other nationals home. If there were, this would be a much easier problem to deal with unfortunately. And our job, my job, the job of SPEHA, the job of many others across the US government and elsewhere, is to work continuously to try to figure out what those levers are and take the opportunities when they arise.
We also, as I said, think about how we try to protect against additional arbitrary detentions and hostages. And I think the D-notice, the State Department notices of do not travel, are important. Americans should not travel to countries that have a level four do not travel warning. I do think having nations stand together and collectively condemn countries that are engaged in these practices matters.
I also think that President Biden's executive order and the subsequent issuance of sanctions, for the first time ever, starting in May of 2023 against those who were engaged in these practices, matters. We're not going to solve this problem overnight, unfortunately, but we can keep trying. I can tell you that President Biden is committed to trying and it is a top priority. And I can tell you that Roger, who's sitting here nodding, is committed to trying. And there are people across the US government who are deeply committed to working on these issues.
Dr. Alterman: This is open to anybody. I mean, to me, it's notable that some of the countries that that seem to have embraced this are countries like Russia and China that have complicated, often adversarial relations, with the United States, but a lot that they can hold at risk. Are they trying to change the nature of our relationships? Are they just trying to gain a marginal advantage? If we think broadly about national security issues and international relations, is this a big thing by big countries, or is this a small thing by big countries that just want a huge basket of things to draw from? Packer, anybody?
Prof. Packer: Just a few quick reactions to that. First, allow me to clarify that I fully agree. I think it was very important. And I remember watching on television the mobilization by the Canadian government in Beijing, of, representative states standing together saying, we're watching and we don't accept this. That's different than saying, is there a norm that we're elaborating? If you can't get everyone around that norm, you're in trouble. So this is all that I'm pointing out is we're in the arbitrary detention norm as such is a well-established norm. So there's something else here we have to pay attention to. What I want to say is, I think it's very hard to answer the question because a lot of the cases have specificity. You know, the two Michaels and Huawei, the CEO, very peculiar situation in terms of who, in particular on the Chinese side, we were talking about.
So how much—and that's why I think we need more research, to really drill down a bit and categorize here sensibly—are there peculiarities about certain persons, conditions, cases, types of states and increasingly non-state actors? I mean, the world is getting more and more. It was your Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who gave us the fragile, failing, and so forth. And if you look at indices, there are more and more states in that fat category of failing, fragile, and uncertain. And there's a whole lot of non-state actors in between there that, you know, don't adhere to these norms and so forth.
But I also notice the asymmetrical aspect of this. So what's happening here is that the weaker actors, in some ways, even if they're maybe not weaker like a China has powerful levers it could use, but they're kind of reverting to a kind of unsophisticated, I mean, hostage taking goes back time immemorial. Tribal groups, the pre-state, you know, have done this. This is not sophisticated in its essential character, and also the other element here is not just the asymmetrical. There is an interest of some actors purposefully to destabilize, to sow the seeds. So you're not going to solve that problem by better norms, better mechanisms. No, their position is they're delighted with precisely the kind of mischief that this causes.
Prof. Gilbert: Yeah. I would align myself with much of what John said. So, it's been interesting to me as an observer that when we think about Russia and China specifically in their use of this, yes, they are weaker actors than the United States, but they're not weak actors. It's been interesting that the way that those cases have unfolded has largely been one for one, or one for two prisoner swaps. We have not seen, you know, my colleagues here who know what happens behind the scenes might know differently, but we haven't seen the resolution of these cases be for larger geopolitical concessions or other kinds of things that those states could plausibly demand. And I think that's a very good thing. They're making this about something specific. They would accuse us of doing it first or doing it too.
The two Michaels case, they would say, started with the arrest of Meng Wanzhou. And in many of these cases they point fingers and say that you do this as well. And that is a rhetorical claim that is undermining this understanding of the rules and kind of questioning global leadership of the West, of the liberal international order, and things like that. And in addition to coercing these concessions, it serves to embarrass leaders as well. It's not exclusively about getting that prisoner back or getting that concession, but about making things exceptionally difficult for leaders of democratic states. 
Dr. Alterman: Rachel, I was struck by your comment that we need to be comfortable being uncomfortable. Is part of that not playing by the rules ourselves? And what does that look like?
Ms. Briggs: That's such a good question. Well, I'm going to veer away from the deterrence question. Part of what you're asking. Because that's just not my field of expertise. And this is such an important and critical policy issue that I think it's imperative on all of us not to stray into territory where we're out of our expertise level. So I'm going to put that to one side. And others might answer your question from that perspective. I think we have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable because we've got to behave in different ways. So I'm not necessarily saying, by any stretch of the imagination, we must start breaking international laws and we must sort of rip up treaties. Of course we're not. I mean, I'm very much of the school of thinking, you know, when they go low, we go high. We have to remain ourselves. We have to maintain our values. We have to be true to ourselves in the face of this dreadful activity. But it does, on many levels, require us to do things that we haven't been used to doing.
You know, I talked about having a team of all the talents. Now, on paper, that's a really uncomfortable thing for somebody to do who has clearance in the State Department or the White House. The prospect of bringing around the table a group of people who were not cleared, who were not necessarily inside the foreign policy tent day in, day out, on what is an incredibly sensitive area of national security. You take risks. And I've seen it in practice, not just here, but in in my own country back in the UK, individuals taking risks on bringing you in, sharing stuff that maybe on paper they shouldn't be sharing with you, but they know they can trust you. And what will come from that is a positive outcome somewhere down the road.
So there's a whole set of behaviors, there's a whole set of activities, that will be crucially important to solving this problem. Whether it's bringing somebody home, preventing people from traveling in the first place, or deterring this activity from happening at all, which requires people with security clearance getting comfortable dealing with people who don't have security clearance. People who work in the private sector feeling comfortable coming into the State Department to work on, help in a way, on government type stuff. It's not just government that sort of has to get comfortable with being uncomfortable.
But if we don't get creative in this space, if we're not willing to kind of rip up some of the rules, not the laws, not the international frameworks, but if we're not willing to rip up some of those rules about how we're supposed to behave and who's supposed to be in the room and who's supposed to do what, we just simply won't solve this. And so that's what I was getting at. I'm absolutely not advocating that we sort of start behaving like them, but they are being very creative. And if we don't get creative quickly, we're just not going to solve the problem.
Dr. Alterman: Okay. I think we have some note cards. If people have questions, we'll try to get a few questions before we have to break. And I guess we're running a little bit late, so we'll try to move things along. What does hostage-taking mean for the way international security is evolving? We all talked about how this is happening more and more. Is it just going to be a messier and more lawless space? And if so, what can we do to bring it back? 
Ms. Daskal: Before we go there, I want to respond to Rachel's comment because I want to be clear, we, I, do not endorse sharing classified information or sharing particularly sensitive information externally. That said, you know, I meet with families. Roger and his team meet with families. We talk to people from the outside and particularly in some of these hard cases, you know, we want to hear the ideas that the families bring to us. We want to hear the ideas that other people bring to us. Having families put pressure and apply leverage in the right place can be extraordinarily useful. So I think, well, again, we don't endorse sharing information that is protected or privileged, but absolutely think that it is essential that we have conversations. And we do have those conversations with a range of actors. And that's an important part of how we work on some of these cases.
Dr. Alterman: John, you're nodding. I mean, what does this mean for the way we should expect countries to be engaging with each other. Is this going to be a trend? There's just more messiness and lawlessness and shamelessness? 
Prof. Packer: I think that is a trend at the moment. I don't see it going the other way. I actually see most international organizations becoming destabilized, thinner in their normative coherence. I mean, a lot of questions. Will the OSCE survive this year? It hasn’t been budgeted for 2 or 3 years. Right now, the institutions only have nine-month mandates. The UN, you know, the Security Council, and so forth, we could have long conversations. But many, many organizations at the multilateral level are really having a tough time. And I think that's just a reflection of the realities of the world. The consensuses are thin. Now, what do we do about that? I mean, we faced these periods before. Historically, the world has. And even on this specific topic, I was struck by something that, Dani wrote, because I almost forgot that hijacking was like a routine thing. About 40 years ago, when I certainly remember.
Dr. Alterman: When we were young. 
Prof. Packer: Yeah, when we were young. I mean, it was almost a weekly thing, right? On the news, and it was so much so. I fly a lot like probably many people here. It almost doesn't enter my mind anymore that there's going to be a hijacking. Other things I worry about, but not hijacking. There were some simple things which were done that technically address that. But that was also in a period of coherence, coming together at the end of the Cold War, which then gave rise to the 90s and so forth. I'm not sure there's a simple technical fix on this, like carrier sanctions or things like that. But I do think it is worth considering. For example, I'm struck that I don't think there's been a review of conventional diplomatic relations or the conventional consular relations in quite a long time. I don't know if it's worth tailoring some kind of, you know, things evolve. People might be surprised to know that often we talk about the Geneva Conventions, then we talk about the two additional protocols. But there is a third protocol adopted about 10 or 15 years ago on symbols because it had to do with the reality of things changing. So maybe we need to tweak something here. I don't know, maybe it's not a hard law instrument. Maybe we need some kind of a consensus document on specifically inter-state relations.
This is disruptive. It is problematical. But we have bad actors. I don't know the answer for it. I think we have to think about it. We have to do research. And I'm pretty convinced ultimately, we live in a complex, interdependent world, and the costs of this are probably going to mount if they continue.
Dr. Alterman: So let me ask you a question about cost. We got a really important question from the audience. How do we balance the difficult calculation of swaps in individual cases versus the risk of incentivizing this practice? And of course, swaps are sometimes individuals and sometimes it's paying ransom, essentially. How do we think about unpacking that problem? How do we make sure we're not creating the problem we're trying to solve?
Ms. Briggs: Yeah, I might have something to add here. From my experience of working not just these cases, but kidnap for ransom cases, looking back over many years, what strikes me is that it's really important to distinguish between that of which we do to get somebody home and the imperatives which sit around protection of life, the state's role to protect its citizens, and then what we do to end the crime. And too often we conflate the two and say, well, we end the crime by doing something different in the negotiation piece. We end the crime by not conceding. We and in those countries, and this is talking about kidnap for ransom countries, and I know that the parallel isn't exactly the same, but in those countries that, for example, banned ransom payments, made it illegal, it did not end the crime. It sent it underground, and it made it much more dangerous, much more complicated for families. Essentially what was realized in those countries where it had become endemic was the way that we solve this is by tackling the root causes. What is it that sort of creates this economy? Let's unpack that. And that was ultimately how those problems were solved. And I think that, you know, while these are different types of cases, there are there are some similarities here.
Now in kidnap for ransom cases where it's about money, I can tell you categorically if one of my loved ones is taken, as actually they were 30 years ago, I would remortgage my home, I would sell all my possessions, I would do whatever I absolutely could to get them home. Now, you don't have as much of that leverage in state hostage cases because of what's being asked and who's around the table. But it is not completely unknown for families to be able to solve these cases themselves. I can think of a number of examples off the top of my head where options were possible but didn't go through the government.
This is why this crime is the perfect crime. Because you take one individual and you say, well, it's just one individual, but actually it embodies so much more. And the family at the heart of this will do anything to get that person home. So you have to decouple that which you do to get somebody home from that which you do to end the crime. And it's really not helpful, in my view, to conflate the two.
Dr. Alterman: Any other thoughts on how we don't incentivize the problem ourselves? 
Prof. Gilbert: I will align myself entirely with everything that Rachel said. I think that a “no concessions” logic sounds quite appealing, right? We shouldn't reward bad actors. We worry that it incentivizes more violence. But it punishes the family. It punishes the hostage or the detainee. It is a temporal tradeoff between the person who is actually being held captive today versus the potential captives of tomorrow. And there is a major collective action problem. There is always this incentive to cheat. Someone is always willing to pay when their loved one's life is on the line. So making concessions or negotiating works to bring people home, as distasteful as that might be. But it works to bring people home. And so how do we think more broadly about a strategy that, on the one hand, is bringing our people home and thinking more broadly, the second panel today is going to talk about it, how do we deter this practice going forward? How do we condition other countries to change their behavior and work collectively to end the practice once and for all? 
Ms. Daskal: Yeah, I'll just add that. You know, the evidence doesn't bear out the premise. The evidence is not there that when we negotiate and we bring an American home, the country immediately goes back and picks up another American. It’s just not what happens. You look at the 60 people that this administration brought home. We have, I mean, obviously there have been some particular actors that have engaged in repeat bad actions, heinous actions. But as a whole, as a trend, it’s just not what we're seeing. So I just don't think the evidence bears out the premise. 
Dr. Alterman: Okay, I could do this all afternoon but we're actually running a little bit behind schedule. So, let me apologize to people whose questions, excellent questions, I didn’t get to ask. Let me very much thank the panelists, and again, thank the Wilson Center, Global Affairs Canada, for their partnership on this. And we look forward to the next panel with my friend Merissa. Thank you.
Panel 2: Frameworks and Collective Responses Against Arbitrary Detention
Merissa Khurma: Thank you so much, Chris, and thanks to all of you for tuning in online as well. A reminder to all of you that you can also submit comments and questions. I'm really delighted to be moderating this conversation today and to continue the discussion that we started earlier with speeches by the Secretary of State and Foreign Minister Joly, but also the discussion that just took place. So, this panel will focus on exploring the frameworks and collective responses against arbitrary detention, very much continuing the conversation further.
So, I am delighted to welcome Jason Rezaian, who is a former Washington Post correspondent in Iran, where he was detained for 544 days and released in January of 2016. Jason currently writes for The Washington Post and is also a CNN contributor. Ambassador Louise Blais, who served as Canada's Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York from 2017 until 2021 and is currently a senior business advisor to the Business Council of Canada. And Lara Symons, who as chief executive of Hostage International, has extensive experience in directly assisting families who have been affected by either kidnap or arbitrary detention, and then also supporting former hostages and detainees. And we've heard our previous panelists discuss how important families play, the role they play in all of this and how they're impacted by this. So welcome, and thanks to all of you.
I'd like to kick off the conversation with, basically, you know, the issue of collective response to hostage-taking or hostage diplomacy. I'm reminded by Rachel's statement on the importance of framing, and perhaps that's another conversation to have. But how can collective responses fortify our shared security? And what does that collective response actually look like? Is it led primarily by states, and who are the states that should lead it and participate in it? And Jason, I'd like to start with you. 
Jason Rezaian: Thank you, Marissa, and thank you, everybody, for being here today. As I look around, I see a lot of friends, a lot of former hostages, and people who have worked on my case and others. It reminds me that eight years after my release, we’re growing a very substantial and robust community. For me, where it starts in terms of a collective response is having a clear understanding of what we're talking about. Both in terms of government responses, as the last panelists indicated, and the motivations for different states that engage in this behavior. So, the responses necessarily also need to differ.
Also, it's important how we talk about it publicly when another person is taken. When I was detained ten years ago in Iran, after I returned and read a lot of the statements made by U.S. officials, I was very bothered by how it was characterized. And I think that's a common sentiment shared by many of us. Fortunately, that has changed a lot because of advocacy, but also because of communication and dialogue between us and the stakeholders in government who are tasked with bringing people home. We need to call it what it is. Terms like “arbitrary detention” and “wrongful detention” confuse people; they confuse the public. As someone who writes about these cases on a weekly basis, I know that the average American doesn't care when they hear the term “wrongfully detained” or “arbitrarily detained.” They might assume that person must have done something wrong to get themselves detained. But when you hear the term hostage, you're talking about a whole different thing.
And I'd like to add one more thing: these responses need to be collective and coordinated in the same way the hostage-taking by states is coordinated. In the cases of my friends Haleh and Siamak sitting in the front and Nizar Zakka in the back, everybody can attest to the fact that every aspect of the Iranian state was mobilized against us. Their intelligence gathering services, their law enforcement, their judiciary, their executive branch, their parliament, their state media, propaganda apparatus—everything. We don't have that same coordinated response yet. I feel like we're getting there, but still, this is very much a work in progress. 
Ms. Khurma: Thank you. Jason. Louise, you also were at the helm at the UN when a lot of these discussions were taking place. How do you get more states involved? Because collective response involves getting more people on board. And of course, they have to be part of the declaration. But there was also the operationalization, which we heard earlier in the panel. So what does that look like and who should be leading? 
Louise Blais: Thank you very much, Marissa. I'm really happy to be here. I apologize that I will have to leave at 3:30, but I'll be brief in my remarks because so much has already been said. I think the first panel was absolutely spot on. I couldn't agree more with everything that was discussed. Specifically, to Jon's point about how the world has changed, and how the bad actors are clearly not signing the Declaration and not respecting international law. We already have the necessary framework, legally and otherwise, internationally. However, these bad actors choose to disregard it, and they face very little consequence when they do so. If anything, they're incentivized. So that really limits what can be done and who can lead. I firmly believe that we have to—and this might sound a bit harsh—but I think what we need to do is find a way to remove emotions and bring the focus back to strategic interests.
In terms of the UN, where I have a lot of experience, I believe we should try to get the UN involved in advocating for specific cases. We should remove the state from the equation, but not the families; we can never do that. Instead, we can have a mediator to diffuse the amount of leverage these actors have over the democracies we're talking about. Can we put a middle person and say, ""You talk to the hand until we're ready to talk to you""? Is there a way we can be a bit tougher in our response while ensuring the safety of the hostage?
Obviously, this approach must be nuanced and carefully implemented. I also think we need to modernize the instruments we have. The Convention, the hostage convention from 1979, needs updating to reflect the cases we're seeing today.
Even if we know some measures don't work, we should continue to apply pressure. For instance, we could pursue another resolution inside the General Assembly based on the Declaration, condemning this practice. We might even advocate for a special session of the General Assembly against this practice, though it's unlikely that the United States and Canada alone would spearhead this effort. We need to identify allies willing to put some skin in the game without always being at the forefront ourselves. We need to improve our diplomacy and listen more. Many countries around the world, even those that have signed, are tired of being told what to do. We need them on board with our initiatives, and it has to be a two-way street. I'll discuss later how we can involve the business sector in this effort. But that's where I would start: not because shaming doesn't work, but because it does. We must continue to shame bad actors. If we don't, we've abdicated our responsibility. We have found instruments to do that. But behind the scenes, we must toughen up and remove the leverage these actors have over individual countries and leaders, as it can and has influenced elections in the past. It's a tough business, indeed. 
Ms. Khurma: Absolutely. And use the mechanisms that are already there, but also, not be afraid to reform what is needed to reform or create new ones. As we heard, creativity is key to all the tools that are at our disposal. Lara, you had Hostage International, which is an international NGO. You work with the families. How can they be part of the collective response? And how can other NGOs also be part of that collective response, working hand in hand with the states at the forefront of this effort? 
Ms. Symons: Thank you very much. And I extend my gratitude to all our hosts for inviting me to this panel today. The role of the family is critical in this. It was alluded to in the previous panel and by our keynote speakers. The family and the hostage are always at the center of an arbitrary detention or any type of hostage-taking. They are the ones who are paying the biggest price for this. They are the main stakeholders, not only suffering during the initial weeks, months, and unfortunately, years that arbitrary detentions go on for, but also enduring the aftermath.
When a case ends and a hostage comes home, it's the end of that case for everybody else, and they move on to the next matter. For the family and the hostage, there are years of recovery ahead of them. They have to rebuild their lives. They can't return to the lives they had before, and they will carry trauma with them. Both families and hostages experience this trauma and must live with it for years. At Hostage International, we have people coming to us more than 30 years after a hostage-taking event to seek support. That's how deeply the trauma affects them, and we must never forget that.
So, how do we involve families in this? Obviously, the hostage is another matter we can discuss later, and Jason can speak to that. But how do we involve families in a way that will help the overall response? It's by bringing them to the table. They must be partners in this process, not shut out. I think the previous panel alluded to that being very important. So, what do we do? We bring them to the table. They are shared information, not classified information, but relevant information. We've seen this in kidnap cases, where governments are potentially more willing to share because they see it as a security threat rather than solely a consular matter. In many of those cases, governments have involved the family, informing them of the perpetrators’ modus operandi, tactics, and demands. They have presented options to the family and listened to their input. The family doesn't only bring themselves to the table; they have connections they can leverage. There might be employers working on behalf of their employees to secure their release, media contacts, or civil society with valuable information. The family serves as both a stakeholder and someone who can bring a cross-sector approach to the resolution and response. Ultimately, the resolution is carried out by governments in state-to-state arbitrary detentions. However, it's incredibly important to recognize that families have a crucial role to play. In the United States, SPEHA responded to past cases' criticism, where they didn't involve the family, resulting in terrible outcomes. They have taken this feedback on board and now have a response protocol applicable to both non-state and state hostage-takings. This opens up possibilities for a more collective response. 
Ms. Khurma: Thank you for that. And Louise, I know you're mindful you must leave earlier. So, I want to get back to you because you also mentioned, in addition to the role of states, there's also a very important role for the private sector or businesses. Can you elaborate on that?
Ms. Blais: Sure, I'm happy to share my perspective on this. Before delving into the security impact of this practice, it's crucial to address its economic implications. This is where we have leverage, as I mentioned earlier. China, for example, is now overplaying its hand by making it difficult for Western companies to conduct business there, as they are arbitrarily detaining businesspeople on accusations of spying. Highlighting the business impact to those practicing this behavior is important. We need to back our words with action and be prepared for difficult conversations between businesses and governments. When we discuss security issues, they can take various forms, including how companies conduct themselves in a country, which can pose risks. Unfortunately, Canada and the United States have limited tools to prevent our companies from investing in these countries, aside from imposing sanctions, which may not always be feasible. While this may not align with the official stance of the Business Council of Canada, it's worth exploring collaborations between the government and the business sector to enhance our leverage and tools in such situations.
Additionally, I want to highlight an incident from three years ago when I was at the UN We were trying to gather as many signatures as possible for the declaration. On the morning of the announcement, I received panicked calls from ambassadors of different countries before 7 a.m., requesting to remove their names from the declaration. This shows the pressure some countries face to refrain from signing. Although we may not have achieved getting their names on the declaration, we forced these countries to reveal their true intentions. Every time we compel these bad actors to use their influence, they have less to wield elsewhere. So, even if it seems like those directly involved are not signing, we're still making them pay a price and forcing the issue, which is crucial to continue doing. 
Ms. Khurma: Speaking of tools at our disposal, Louise mentioned businesses in the private sector. Jason, what other tools are there that can be mobilized to ensure that the collective response is more fortified? 
Mr. Rezaian: I think there are quite a few options available to us. Firstly, we have the Global Magnitsky sanctions, which can be activated. However, for various reasons, governments have been reluctant to use them in wrongful detention cases so far.
Here in the United States, we have our legal system. Some of you may know that I and others have obtained massive judgments against the Islamic Republic of Iran. However, these judgments are essentially just pieces of paper that our justice system has decided not to leverage against Iran. These judgments usually take the form of punitive damages, designed to punish. We need to become much more comfortable with imposing real costs for this behavior. A conversation that I've had often with many people in this room is that there is currently no real cost. I wholeheartedly agree with my dear friend Rachel that we must do everything we can to bring individuals home. Sometimes, this may involve concessions that we don't feel comfortable with. However, at the same time, we need to consider how we can make this behavior harder in the future. We need to get very creative.
Another idea that some of us have discussed is involving the business community. One of the previous panelists mentioned the D-designation that the State Department has for countries that engage in wrongful detention. What about implementing an airline tax for those countries? Millions of people travel to China and Iran every year. Increasing the cost of a ticket to one of these countries, perhaps even doubling it, could deter some people from going. And reducing foreign currency income to countries like Iran would have a significant impact. So, it requires thinking outside the box and expanding the toolkit available to us. 
Ms. Khurma: And Lara, what does that look like from your perspective, given the work that you do so closely with families? What are some of the ideas that have come about to just expand that toolbox?
Ms. Symons: Well, from my perspective, and considering the position of families, I believe the biggest hurdle or challenge to a collective response is the lack of clear criteria for designating arbitrary detention by individual governments. This applies at both the national and international levels. Families face a situation where their loved one is detained under dubious circumstances, and they expect their government to have clear assessment rules for determining whether it constitutes arbitrary detention and what response should follow. Unfortunately, this clarity is lacking almost everywhere. The U.S. is an exception with the Levinson Act, which provides clear criteria for Americans to determine if a detention is wrongful and outlines the subsequent actions. However, this isn't the case for many families in other countries.
So, what options do they have? One tool available to them is petitioning the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions. While the UN Working Group doesn't have a specific category for state hostage takings, it can rule on whether a detention is arbitrary, meaning it contravenes international law. When a family receives this legal ruling from the UN, it's incredibly powerful. It validates their position and that of the hostage, stating that the detention is wrong and illegal. Unfortunately, this is an underutilized tool by governments. Many governments leave it to the families to pursue while they continue their strategy of dealing with the detaining state. However, governments should recognize and utilize these UN rulings more effectively. While like-minded countries may not always adhere to one nation's criteria for assessing arbitrary detention, they should accept the ruling of the UN, an independent body, stating that detention is arbitrary. This could then prompt a collective response, with states calling out the detaining state based on the UN's determination.
Another aspect to consider is protecting the hostages themselves and ensuring a better response at that level. In many arbitrary detention cases, the hostage does not receive consular visits, which is unacceptable. Especially where the UN has declared the detention arbitrary, the hostage must have access to consular support because something is amiss with that detention. The hostage also needs to be informed because without access to information, the detaining state can control the narrative, leaving the hostage vulnerable to coercion and manipulation. 
Ms. Khurma: Which we know happens in almost all the cases. 
Ms. Symons: They are vulnerable to that. And if they do that, that also hampers the response of their homes, their home country. So, it's not in the interests of anyone, least of all the hostages, but also the state negotiating the release for there not to be consular access. Now the Vienna Conventions on Consular Relations give every state that right to have consular access and to seek legal representation for their national, and the UN determination on arbitrary detention can be used as a tool to get other states to call out the detaining state for not allowing the national state to have that access. It should be done. 
Ms. Khurma: Jason?
Mr. Rezaian: I just wanted to add something. I think those arbitrary detention designations by the United Nations are really important and underutilized. They highlight a serial trend that is happening in many of these countries. You can see from cases like Siamak’s, Nizar’s, and mine, the same individuals involved repeatedly. This creates a body of evidence to work with. I also wanted to throw out an idea for the signers of the declaration. Maybe a guarantee of consular access to anybody imprisoned in one of the signing countries to all the other signers could be an easy and initial step to commit to addressing this issue. Consular access is critical in these cases, and many of us have been denied it. Seeing other countries sign on to this commitment would be significant. The last thing I wanted to mention is that at the event at the UN back in September, I was approached by a foreign minister of one of the signing countries who said to me, “I deal with this on a regular basis with a neighboring country of mine, and I never thought about it in this framework.” This is a country that has actually signed on to the declaration. So, there's an aspect of education with like-minded countries who may perceive this as a problem only bigger, more powerful countries deal with. However, once you break it down, you realize that this is a widespread issue. 
Ms. Khurma: Thank you for that, Jason. And, Louise, given that those tools are available but are underutilized and your experience of the UN, why do you think they are underutilized. I mean, is it an awareness problem? Is it just a sort of unwillingness to take that step? 
Ms. Blaise: That's a good question, and I'm not sure I have the answer to it. I would be speculating. I think sometimes we get set in our ways and the way we conduct diplomacy and what our priorities are. It's interesting to note that we often direct families to the UN to seek designation when the state could do it themselves. Personally, I haven't worked directly on such cases, so I don't know the reasoning behind this underutilization. But it's definitely an area that is underutilized. Then there are areas that are ineffective. For instance, we talked about the UN Security Council, where resolutions condemning specific cases have gone unanswered and unresolved.
Additionally, there are new approaches that we could be exploring but aren't. For example, at the UN, we have groups of friends on various topics, but I'm not aware of one specifically focused on this issue. These groups are informal gatherings of ambassadors exchanging best practices and fostering dialogue. While some may argue that there are too many of these groups at the UN, they can be effective in building momentum and keeping issues at the forefront. During my time at the UN, Canada initiated a group of friends on Innovating Financing, which was highly effective in advancing the conversation and maintaining focus on the issue. While the UN General Assembly is crucial, it meets only once a year. Therefore, these informal groups provide an opportunity to continue the dialogue and work on the issue throughout the year.
Ms. Khurma: And that goes back to Jason's point about just education. And it's raising awareness. 
Ms. Blaise: Exactly right. Having ongoing efforts is crucial because people circulate in and out of the UN, and alliances are built over time. It's essential to keep engaging and advocating continuously. I'm in touch with our embassy there, and I couldn't be happier with the person leading this effort for Canada. I'm really proud of our representation. So, I would suggest that we need to continue being persistent and proactive, ensuring that this issue remains at the forefront. Additionally, the education piece is vital. By bringing in unexpected allies who see their interests aligned with ours, we can broaden our support base and strengthen our advocacy efforts. It's about being persistent and strategic in our approach.
Ms. Khurma: So you mentioned something, Louise, that I'm going to go back and ask you about Jason, which is sometimes it's not a priority for states. And this is part of the discussion. Like when does it become a priority, and how do you make it a priority? 
Mr. Rezaian: Well, it often becomes a priority when it becomes politically costly for it not to be a priority. There's a certain adversarial relationship that develops between a family, an employer, or someone dealing with this situation publicly, and the state they're trying to compel to bring a person home.
I knew very well that the Islamic Republic of Iran was holding me, but ultimately, it would be the decision of the president of the United States, whoever that might be, that would bring me home. I believe my friends here who've been in similar situations understand this feeling as well. It's a delicate balance that needs to be maintained. Roger and his team are incredibly skilled at managing these conflicting dynamics. They understand that families will do whatever they need to do, but it won't change how they do their job. I've personally spoken with him on several cases, and he's always had this approach. I believe his predecessors in this position held the same attitude. I've witnessed how my news organization, along with others, advocated for individuals like Evan Gershkovich from The Wall Street Journal and Brittney Griner from the NBA and WNBA. This advocacy makes a significant difference. Furthermore, the number of friends and allies of this issue in the United States has increased over the last decade. We've had at least 20 states where constituents have been taken hostage by foreign governments. Consequently, there are now dozens of members of Congress and Senators who've had to confront this issue firsthand. In our work at CSIS, we aim to highlight this as a nonpartisan issue, possibly the last nonpartisan issue, and it's crucial to keep it in that realm. Ultimately, individuals don't come home until there's a political cost to not bringing them home. 
Ms. Khurma: Lara, do you want to comment on this from the perspective of families? This is the most important priority for them, and how do you have that conversation when the states may talk about it, but may or may not act on it as a priority? 
Ms. Symons: I mean, for families, they need to get in front of their governments. And that's again about having the right person they feel is prioritizing this. For many states that don't have a figure such as SPEHA or SOHA in Canada, citizens are frustrated by dealing with the civil servants day-to-day who are coming and going and who don't have the institutional knowledge behind this. There's often a lack of handovers between government personnel who are dealing with the matter. And I've been in meetings with families where they've said, ""But you've just contradicted what your colleague told me at the last meeting.” And that takes away any reassurance that the government is prioritizing this and doing their best to bring the loved one home.
So, it’s really important for families to know that this is that there's someone accountable, senior level, who is taking the lead and that's why we get so many requests in countries where there isn't a SPEHA for, you know, “Can we see the foreign minister, can we see the Prime Minister?” They want to have that face-to-face meeting with the person that they think can call the shots, and until they do, they are not satisfied. So, I think following the lead of what the United States has done with SPEHA, I think is a good idea because it will help families feel that they are being given the attention it deserves. I think that's a starting point, getting collective action behind that. Yes. I mean, I've been in meetings where families have said to the government personnel, “So you don't have the answer to that question, but have you asked your allies? Have you asked your other governments who maybe have had this experience that you haven't had?” You see them grabbing their pens and scribbling, that they’ll take that away. So, I think, yeah, why haven't they done that? You know, that should have been happening at the outset because at the end of the day, if every government has partners that they can use that information for a lot of the time, it's not classified information at all. It's simply information that might be out there to the public. But it's also about best practice and what works. So, I think it's not that having a better response. Collective action partnerships with other states and other sectors of society, and having the right people in the government role would be the place to start. 
Ms. Khurma: And I mean, we've talked about this, already, you know, the role of the United Nations, the role of other multilateral organizations, the role of civil society, but specifically in addressing this as a security threat - you know, Jason, you talked about elevating the cost. What role do all these players play? In not just furthering the discussions, but strengthening the mechanisms available? What does it take?
Mr. Rezaian: I think we're still figuring out what it's going to take, right? And I feel like we're a lot closer to it today than we were 4 or 5 years ago, but we're still a long way away. When President Biden declared the national emergency a year and a half ago, I felt as though, okay, this is an issue that has caught their attention. It's no longer seen as one-off cases done by bad actors. This is part of a trend, and not a trend just in one country, but a trend in several countries and a series of countries that's expanding.
And so there is this recognition and this acknowledgment that this is spiraling out of our control. And, you know, when we put numbers on it at the time, I was arrested, you know, I think there were probably 3 or 4 people arbitrarily detained or wrongfully detained. There wasn't a specific designation for that at the time. There were many more people who were being held hostage by terrorists or criminal organizations. The numbers have flip-flopped, you know, to foreign states being the main perpetrator in these cases. Sixty-something people, I think the Secretary said, are still on the list. What if that number grows to 600 people? You know, is the State Department going to be able to deploy resources to handle that? And if the U.S. government decides under whatever administration happens to be in power, that they aren't going to deploy those kinds of resources, what does it mean to our ability to travel the world? What does it mean to know our ability to do business in other countries? What does it mean for the essence of what it means to be a citizen of this country and any other country that is a democracy? And I think that's how we have to be thinking about this in the very short term, medium term and long term, because it is a threat to the very idea of being a citizen of a democratic country. 
Ms. Khurma: And, Louise, I know you have to leave us, but I want to give you the floor for any final remarks you want to add to all the excellent points you already made. 
Ms. Blais: Oh, thank you. I don't want to take any more time. I think all the important things have been said, and I hope that there was this was helpful for those who deal with this every day that have to find the solutions. I think I want to just congratulate everyone that's been involved, Chris for being such a great partner with Canada through the years, the Wilson Center has been my honor to be here and share a little bit of my experience and have such great panelists to do it with. So, I will grab my bag and go. And I hate to do that, but I do have to catch that flight. 
Ms. Khurma: So thank you for being with us today. Thank you. We do have time for maybe 1 or 2 questions, and I have one here from our online audience. Erin, from the Institute of World Politics: how can governments be more proactive and dry up the supply of potential hostages? It appears that the U.S. State Department travel warnings aren't being read or heeded.
Mr. Rezaian: I mean, I don't think that. I've talked to people in government over the last several years about the idea of putting travel bans on specific countries. I don't think that anybody has decided that that is a particularly useful idea or practical one. In a country like Iran, at any given time, there are tens of thousands - I think the last count is about 13,000 - U.S. citizens, dual nationals who've registered as residing in Iran. So that's the number of people that have held their hand up and said that they’re here. You assume that the number is double, triple that. So, you know, drying up the number of possible hostages in these countries is a harder task, I think, than doing the hard work of figuring out how to make it less interesting, to the perpetrators who are doing it. 
Ms. Symons: I think on the subject of travel bans, I mean, a lot of the cases that we're supporting are in arbitrary detention are dual nationals, and any travel ban will be harmful to them, the people who are most at risk. So they have family. A lot of these people are taken when they've gone to say goodbye to loved ones who are on their deathbed, and to deprive them of that is almost as bad as, you know, exposing them to arbitrary detention. So it's not the solution. A travel ban. What could be better is borrowing tips, maybe from the private sector, about what information should be given to travelers. You know, when employees are sent out by a company to a high-risk state, there is a risk assessment there, you know, the routines are looked at where they're going to be staying, what they're going to be doing, the type of work they're going to be doing. And that plays into how they can mitigate the risk of being either kidnapped or detained arbitrarily. So I think there are other ways to be creative, again, we have to be creative in terms of deterrence as well as response. There are other things that can be done that governments can be proactive in changing the travel advice in a way that is more helpful and does not punish those most at risk.
Ms. Khurma: Thank you for highlighting once again the important role that the private sector plays not only with economic leverage, but also—just as you mentioned—the tips and that conversation that you have with the private sector. One more question. This is to you, Jason, but I'm sure, Lara, you can also maybe add to it. What are some examples of acceptable concessions that you had referred to? 
Mr. Rezaian: I think that the truth is that, as far as I'm concerned, bringing fellow citizens home as quickly and safely as possible is going to require all sorts of flexibility in concession making. In some of the cases that we've seen, it's been one-on-one trades, there's been sanctions lifted, there's been money changing hands. There's been presidential tweets. I mean, there's been all sorts of stuff that's happened. I don't want to put a number on it. You know, to me, it's bring these people home as quickly, as safely as possible, and at the same time, put in the resources, energy, and time to figure out how to make it costlier and how to punish on the back end of these cases, which, you know, I believe that that process is ongoing. But we need an action plan. We need tools to use, and we need it pretty soon. And some of these countries that do this need to feel the hurt in a very public way. One of the things that didn't come up on the last panel about the tools, I think it needs to be made public and clear. This is the cost of doing this particular activity.
Ms. Khurma: So shaming. But then we've also heard a previous panelist talk about living in a shameless sort of or increasingly shameless culture. 
Mr. Rezaian: Not just shame—expense.
Ms. Khurma: Expense. Making it hurt, like you said. Lara, anything you want to add here from a perspective of, you know, working with the families and the victims? 
Ms. Symons: I mean, going back to what the first panel said, and Rachel mentioned this, that, you know, the families will pay anything to get the loved ones home and do anything. So, what concessions are acceptable? Any in their view. I mean, that, you know, ultimately that is how the families will approach this. And that's also why they're looking at every option open to them. They're looking at, shall I go to the media and make this a really public case? Shall I go on a hunger strike? They will, and we've seen them do it. They will do anything. So, I think states have to take into account that that is the family position.
I think probably just to wind up on the whole issue of this being a security threat, and what that might look like for fortifying shared security, I would look at the example of kidnap for ransom where you have—and this is my experience from the private sector speaking here—where you have cases where the states are leading and, where the private sector is leading. What does collective action, what does collective response look like? We have a situation where in kidnapping, which anybody can be kidnapped and many are sometimes they're taking individually, but when they're taken in groups of multinationals and the state is leading on the response, have we ever seen collective action, collective response? No. Every state has its own policy that it implements, concessions or otherwise, and its own approach.
And what's the result been? The result has been that some of those hostages have come home based on their nationality and some have not. And for families sitting, waiting for the loved one to go home, those who don't. Absolute devastation and anger. Real anger. So what does the private sector tell us about this? Well, when I was in the private sector, I saw cases of multiple victims being taken, multiple hostages, different nationalities and crucially, different organizations that they were working for. And the private sector response was, well, first of all, the kidnappers would say, “We're going to divide you up into groups.” So they wanted to negotiate separately with each organization. Private sector responses don't let them do that. We have to act together. This group of people, whatever their nationality, whatever whoever they were working for, they have got to come out together. And the family member would say, “Oh, but what if there's an opportunity to get my loved one out first.? I don't want to lose that.” And the response from the advisers was, “What if another family member said that and that left your loved one behind? And then you were stuck?” and they said, “Oh no, that's right. We need to do this together.” And so what they did was bring all the organizations who had employees caught up in the same situation and got them to agree on a joint strategy, collective response to a security threat, joint strategy to get them out. And guess what? They got them all out together. So, I think that is maybe a takeaway that we can, we can learn from other sectors on how to respond to this crime, either kidnapping arbitrary detention. I see them as, you know, something that you can compare. And I think that's possibly what we can learn from. 
Ms. Khurma: Thank you for that. So, we’re nearing the end. We want to make sure that there's enough time for networking and sharing more contacts and information. But thank you so much, to both of you for sharing your expertise, and your lived experience, as well, just a few points just to sort of remind us of some of the takeaways from today. We've heard this from Foreign Minister Joly as well as Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, that the practice of arbitrary detention, which is very often used for diplomatic leverage, is an important international security concern. And as we've seen and heard, from Jason and others, I'm very lucky to be mentored daily, almost by Haleh as the founder of the Middle East program. And heard her story that, this presents a very serious challenge to the international security system, as well as the international rules-based order that offers different norms to deal with, but unfortunately, it's not always respected by the various actors. And the key is to engage many stakeholders, from the families to the private sector, to the various bodies that are already in place, such as the United Nations, as well as civil society and international NGOs.
Of course, there's a lot more to do about this. The conversation is continuing, and we look forward to more discussions. But going back to some of the earlier remarks from the previous panel, it's about investing in data and research, to make sure that we have a lot more information. Information sharing and sharing of best practices and lessons learned is key to further strengthening all the different tools and ensuring that we have more tools at our disposal in the future. And as you know, going back to your point, Jason, to make it very costly for this to happen and so strengthen deterrence. So, thank you for all of you for being here in person and for our online audience. Thanks to CSIS, to Canada's Global Affairs and the State Department for all the work. And thanks to my dear colleague Chris Sands, for his leadership on this very important issue at the Wilson Center. Thank you.

66,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/bader-al-saif-kuwaits-perceptions-people-and-progress,Unknown,"February 6, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS podcast published on February 6, 2024. Listen to the podcast here.
Jon Alterman: Bader Al-Saif is an assistant professor of history at Kuwait University, a consultant, and a non-resident fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. Bader, welcome to Babel.
Bader Al-Saif: Thank you, Jon. Pleasure to be with you.
Jon Alterman: So, what is the mood in the Middle East these days, and are you surprised at this mood?
Bader Al-Saif: I'm glad that we're starting with the mood because it's on everyone's minds. It translates to everyone's actions. Let me tell you. I've been to all Gulf capitals plus Iraq since the war on Palestine unleashed in October, and I haven't seen such anti-Americanism in a very, very long time and even ever. We haven't had such levels of anger, real anger. It's not only popular anger that manifests in weekly protests, boycotts, angry memes, social media, and coordinated action, but you also see it at the official level, which has been quite interesting.
I haven't seen the Omani foreign establishment be this expressive, be this angry. I haven't seen them go out and condemn in such clear language. I haven't seen the Qataris increase their dose of statements and the feeling of being underappreciated with their mediation efforts.
Another example which has caught my attention is the UAE, and specifically their presence in the UN in 2023 and the amount of the successive statements that have only grown more concerned with U.S. inaction, Israeli action, and the lack of support that the issue gets.
Jon Alterman: You've talked about this as in some cases the Arab public is leading their governments. For the most part, foreign policy issues are considered sovereignty issues that the public has deferred to their governments about. Certainly, in the EU, normalization wasn't popular before it happened. Once it did happen, however, the Emirati public largely deferred to the government. Why is this different?
Bader Al-Saif: Palestine is an issue that's central to many, many generations. The manifestations of that interest in Palestine come in different ways, and they may not be ways that can be polled or put out very publicly, but they are ingrained, not only in the Arab Gulf states, but across the larger Middle East, including non-Arab countries like Iran and Turkey.
This comes up the clearest when there is naturally an attack. Now, leaderships in the region do not like for Palestine to spiral out for various reasons. This is a cause that shouldn't be living on as long as it has. We're talking about 75 years of agony, many years of occupation, displacement, and injustice in various forms.
But this also translates to domestic issues within each country. On the one hand, leaders across generations using this cause to advance their own interests. I'm thinking of the Egypt of Gamal Abdel Nasser moving down. If we jump to 2023- 2024, the Houthis in Yemen are using this to advance their personal issues.
So, it becomes really messy and confused. It confuses a lot of the public in the process. This is not healthy for the development of those countries. Many of these countries are looking for the prosperity of their people. They want to move into the future, yet this issue keeps pulling them back.
This issue really needs a just and lasting resolution that takes on all parties. It’s really complex and multilayered, and for this cause to continue unchecked, unchanged, doesn't bode well for anyone.
Jon Alterman: When I talked to leaders in the Gulf and the Levant, there was a sense that the younger generation didn't have the same connection to Palestine that the older generation did, and that people had become desensitized. They were interested in entertainment, music, jobs, and all kinds of other things, and that Palestine was the failed cause of an earlier generation.
I was a little bit surprised, because this is a younger generation that grew up watching images on Al Jazeera, that grew up with social media, and generally had exposure to Palestine. But people told me, ""No, no, no. Palestine, we're moving on. That's sort of retro and doesn't have salience.""
After the Al-Ahli hospital bombing a few days into this conflict, which ironically seems not to have been carried out by Israel, we saw it come back to young generations with vigor, almost shockingly stronger.
Were you at all surprised, or did you never buy into the narrative?
Bader Al-Saif: I wasn't surprised, and I think I'm on the record saying that this has been something that didn't dissipate. I say this because I teach at Kuwait University, and I see both Kuwaiti and Arab students in and out, and I see these discussions come forward.
Let me give you an example. I teach a class called contemporary Arab affairs. In the class, I try to do a simulation, to have a person be in someone else's shoes so that we can move on and resolve a conflict. I chose the Palestine-Israel conflict. I had certain students take on the role of Israel. I had to sit down and convince them that this is a simulation, you're not going to be castigated or looked down at for being Israel. So that was one.
Second, you should see the amount of attack that came from the other Arab states in the simulation, including Kuwait, is quite indicative of popular mood among the youngsters.
This not only in Kuwait. I see this in the other states that do have openness to protests. We saw this in Bahrain. Bahrain has been consistently protesting for the last 17 or 18 weeks. Bahrain is normalized, too. So that's one clear example there.
I've also seen this in Qatar and Oman. For others, you see this across social media and discussion forums. So, it comes in different ways. I don't think it has died out.
Jon Alterman: Do you think this conflict changes in a durable way Gulf states' perceptions of the United States as a reliable partner?
Bader Al-Saif: I would put this conflict as part of a larger semblance of various acts that have been taking place in the region and in the world. The United States is not the United States that we've known. There has been a concerted effort for it, in its own words, to pivot away from the Middle East, and we've seen this in successive administrations regardless of party, starting with Obama.
It's not only because of what's happening with Israel and Palestine alone, although that's very central. How reliable can they be? They're not going anywhere, regardless of what they try to say. They're there. The numbers speak for themselves. The bases are there. I think they keep getting pulled in.
The United States is trying to bring in a grand strategy that looks at the Gulf within world politics as opposed to looking at the Middle East and the Gulf on its own. That's the issue that they need to move beyond because they've been trying to take the battle to China or to compete with the Far East, but the Far East is in the Middle East anyway.
They need to try to bring those blocks together. The Gulf has taken the cue. They've been trying to diversify. This is not new in their long history. The United States has been a phase in a very long history of various superpowers they have shown, and this will be a very interesting game to watch to see how things fit differently.
I don't think any of the current steps taking place are displacing the number one place for the United States, and that will continue for some time.
Jon Alterman: You know from a U.S. perspective, partnership with the Middle East has been difficult. There's been a lot of complaints that the Middle East has not been supportive of the U.S. view of Ukraine, despite the fact that the U.S. view is that the same sanctity of international borders is what brought the United States to defend Kuwait in 1990.
When I was in Kuwait a little more than a year ago and talked about the dissonance for American audiences between defending the Kuwaiti border and defending the Ukrainian border, folks in a Kuwaiti audience said to me, ""Well, Ukraine's really far from Kuwait."" And I looked and said, ""But Kuwait is really far from the United States."" There seems to be a real dissonance between the Gulf's sense of cooperation with the United States on security issues and the Gulf's willingness to support the United States outside the Gulf on security issues.
Bader Al-Saif: It's more of a mixed reaction, really, in the Gulf. I don't want to paint a holistic image for all states, and I'm glad that you started with Kuwait because from a foreign policy perspective, they've come up very clearly, very early on condemning the attack, and they've been the least to engage with the Russian side from my own observation among the Gulf states. The Kuwaitis came out very forcefully in their opinion. So did Qatar.
So Kuwait is trying to have a more nuanced approach. The other states see themselves as larger fish in the pond, and they have other global interests that demand them to take a middle position for the sake of mediating the conflict. I think that's how they presented themselves. Some circles in American policymaking circles have bought into it and others have not.
It's all connected because with the Russia situation there is an energy issue there. And I think that's the same concern that some of those Gulf states had when it comes to Russia in terms of how much can you put pressure in ways that don’t disrupt the OPEC+, in ways that don’t disrupt the energy security in place?
Jon Alterman: What do you see the future U.S. role in the Middle East being? Given tension over global perspectives, disappointment in the region with the U.S. view, and the possibility that we could end up with a very different U.S. position on Palestine, either through success or failure over the next several years? If you had a crystal ball and were looking forward 10 years, what do you think the U.S. role in the Middle East in general is going to be and what is the U.S. role in the Gulf going to be?
Bader Al-Saif: Don't we wish we all had these crystal balls, right? Let me flip the question. I think it should start from the region because it's the regional perspective that should matter the most, and that's what the Americans should listen to in order to guide their policymaking. I think the region needs to believe further in itself, and that's what the region has been doing, by the way. For the past few years, we've seen a few hints here and there, and that self-realization, ironically, is what the Americans have been calling for the longest time. ""We can't take on the tab forever. You need to take care of your own security. You need to share the neighborhood."" Remember that talk from Obama?
So, all of this is really coming to fruition. I think we are at very exciting times in which there will be more than an organic solution or an organic method to resolving conflicts. Don't forget the UAE and Saudi are very keen on developing their local defense capabilities. We've seen a lot of steps in that direction. We've seen also an interest in developing peaceful nuclear energy.
So more and more, we're seeing some of those Gulf states taking matters in their own hands. I think that's a healthy development and that should guide not only relations with the United States but with any other superpower.
Jon Alterman: You've talked at some length about the rising Saudi role in regional diplomacy, partly guided by a Saudi sense of strategic patience. How does that play out as we think about the next decade?
Bader Al-Saif: Saudi Arabia's foreign policy has been very stable if you subtract the first few years of the King Salman era. Since 2021, they've been going back to their original demeanor, and that includes strategic patience.
There is some merit to that strategic patience because as a rising power not only in the region, but in the world. They're among the G20 nations at the moment. They feel that they have a responsibility to the world, both on the economic side when it comes to maintaining the energy supply, but also as the spiritual head of Islam with housing Mecca and Medina.
You need to be calculating, you need to take risk very carefully, and you need to work behind closed doors. And that's what they've been doing, really. They've been sending a lot of messages. They work very hard, and I know you know that as well, because we go to Riyadh all the time, and we talk to many of those officials.
It doesn't look that way to the public. They may seem to some as reactive, lethargic, or slow, but there's a lot of action behind all of this, and that action is certainly coordinated across the Gulf states.
The centrality of Saudi Arabia should not be lost on observers of the region, and they tend to be underestimated, but they shouldn't be. I think that's where things should be gravitating toward, and they are moving forward.
Jon Alterman: In the 1960s and '70s, Kuwait was, in many ways, the engine of the region socially, economically, politically, etc., and it's not now. You've written an article in Al Majalla about the stagnation in Kuwait that's prevailed. Kuwait now has a new emir. It has a new prime minister. What does it take for Kuwait to succeed, and how do you move the system in the direction you think Kuwait wants to or needs to move?
Bader Al-Saif: Let me first start with something at the risk of sounding like a broken record, but this picture is the image of Kuwait in general. Kuwait, regardless of all the problems that it's going through, it goes unnoticed, underestimated as well, and underappreciated across the international arena when it comes to looking at the Middle East.
This is unfortunate because it's the only effective Arab constitutional monarchy. You don't get as much leeway to hit hard on everyone but the emir except in Kuwait. It's a system with a lot of flaws. We have gone through a trauma. I argue in that piece that you mentioned from Al Majalla that we haven't gone through closure yet. Many are still waiting for their remnants of their relatives to come back, and there hasn't been a national strategy to close the chapter. That needs to be done.
What needs to be done as well is to understand that those growing pains of the system should not stall development. We've had a parliament since the '60s. We're on our fourth constitution, Jon. We've had one in 1921, '38, '39, and this one came in '62.
Time is ripe for a fifth, really. Renewing the social contract is something that we can do. They come in various forms. In the United States there have been amendments to the Constitution. Other places have changed their constitutions altogether. We can benefit from looking back at our 60-plus years of this constitutional era. What went wrong? What went right? How can we develop the system further?
Again, it's not being fixated on the system as much as the practices. How do you envision the country moving forward? There is a heated debated, as always, in Kuwait on how to move the country forward.
There needs to be some form of coalescing, and that's why I've been calling for an actual national dialogue. We haven't had a real national dialogue since the occupation, and I'm reminding you and the listeners to the Jeddah Conference that we had in October 1990 under occupation when all Kuwaitis from all types came in to renew their pledge to Al-Sabah and to the constitutional democracy that they've put together.
The time is really ripe to move on with this. And we have a new set, a new crew, as you mentioned right now in Kuwait. We're starting the year off, new government, new emir.
It's not the choice of minister per se that makes or breaks the system. It's bigger than that. How do those ministers work together? What kind of process? What kind of vision do you have for the country? Can we allow that vision to then rule supreme instead of having it go through a lot of debating?
Jon Alterman: There's also the problem in Kuwait that I think you have in the United States, that part of the role of the government that people care about is distributing government resources. In the United States, you have this entitlement state that takes up more than half of the federal budget for welfare, for social security, for Medicare, which people are entitled to, and they see that as a role of the state.
In Kuwait, where the state has remarkable oil wealth, people have taken the role of the state to be to distribute the state's oil wealth in exchange for loyalty. The idea that people would have to be productive seems to be marginalized. In states without parliamentary democracy, the ruler says, ""These are going to be the rules. This is going to have to be how it is."" In Kuwait, the parliament says, ""Let's talk about forgiving everybody's debt.""
Part of the problem of democracy when there are central resources is that people say the role of the government is to give the resources to me and people like me and, in Kuwait, to my tribe. Rather than building resources and building a productive society, you have the state playing the role allocating resources to citizens.
Bader Al-Saif: This is ahistorical. This is not a reflection of Kuwait's history, by the way. This is only when the oil pumping started in the late '40s and the money rushed in in the '50s, and that's the beginnings of the welfare state.
If you look at Kuwait's very long history, and I say this to my students the whole time—look, we have a 300 plus year history. The exception is the oil era. The norm is being in a healthy society that provides to the government. There were a lot of taxes prior to oil, and people contributed to the wellbeing of society, and they were responsible.
When push comes to shove, Jon, they did act in that manner during the occupation. We had Kuwaitis piling up the garbage, cleaning up the streets, distributing food, baking. It takes social re-engineering, and I think the way that this current government started with the message. He said, ""My project is to develop the new economic identity of Kuwait.""
That's very important because you need to change perceptions. That is not only about switching from one welfare system to another, but it's about changing mindsets. It's about reclaiming Kuwaitiness, the Kuwaitiness of sacrifice, those people that perished in sea or in desert trying to make ways for their own people. That needs to move forward.
Only by doing that will you break the addictive cyclicality of the political system. The cyclicality of having people push for more welfare, the government being not strong enough to stop that interaction, and then you end up either with a resignation of the government or a dissolution of parliament and, fast-forward, you repeat again and again. We've been doing this for some time.
Kuwait has been developing in a different direction in the last two to three years. I've written about this in another piece with the Arab Gulf States Institute. I call it “Kuwait's New Doctrine.” In that new doctrine, the emir, then the crowned prince at the time, was trying consciously to break that cycle.
Everyone needs to agree, however, that we need to move forward, and that's where the national dialogue comes in handy. We need to agree on the next steps. We're not going to please everyone. It will be filled with a lot of debates again. There will be some sacrifices that need to be done, but we need to keep an eye on the Kuwait not only of today, but the Kuwait of tomorrow.
Jon Alterman: Let me ask a difficult question. Obviously, this takes a lot of things. It takes political leadership. It takes charisma. It takes maybe changing some of the rules, maybe some constitutional pieces. What's the most important element? Obviously, there are infinite numbers of elements. Is this a question of do you really need a charismatic leader, or do you need a stronger leader, or do you need to get consensus on a different set of rules that will create a different set of outcomes? What do you need to prioritize to get to the point that you're talking about?
Bader Al-Saif: It is a matter of shifting the mindset, and that takes a lot of messaging, cultural shifts, ingraining the history of their own grandpas and grandmoms that sacrificed for the country. I spoke about masked unemployment. That's what I called it, “البطالة المقنعة” because we have very low unemployment rates in Kuwait and arguably in the Gulf even. However, if you dig deep, many of them are just being paid for showing up and fingerprinting at the beginning.
Jon Alterman: You show up once.
Bader Al-Saif: You show once or maybe twice. If you end up going for coffee or running errands, and you need to exit when you leave. Let's not fool ourselves. That's a recipe for disaster. We've been doing that for decades. It might be a misconstrued form of understanding that there is a right to work. Some people think that this means that immediate employment by government, but it doesn't. It doesn't.
Change the mindset. Try to stop that crazy employment. Tell them that, ""I'm going to fund you. I'll still going to redistribute wealth, but I'll do it in a clever way. I'll have certain small to medium businesses pursued. I'll give you a fraction of the oil wealth if the prices are in a good shape. If they're not, you're not getting anything."" There are many ways to still endow people, but to have them maintain their own sanity by being functional citizens, which many of them are not today.
Jon Alterman: The region now looks very dark. When do you think we can start expecting some better news? How good do you think things will get, or do you think we're going to be on this cyclical up and down in the Middle East for many years to come?
Bader Al-Saif: It's a matter of perception, Jon. I ask myself this question every day. The way I look at it is, let's take care of the bad as we celebrate the good at the same time because there are some good stories out there. If you look at the amount of talent and innovation that some of the youth are doing in the region, it's something to keep an eye on. If you look at some of the achievements— such as Oman, for example, where the economy has turned around and they've shown a surplus — and now they're building their own local sovereign wealth fund. That's a story that doesn't get told as much.
Iraq is not in its best of cases. However, if you look at Iraq since 1920, they've never had four-year prime ministers and governments in their very long history as they do now.
So, let's not be too harsh on ourselves. Yes, there is a lot of blood, and it's very dark, and we do not deserve this. No one deserves this. Everyone needs to live in peace. Everyone needs to feel safe. Everyone needs to have a sense of dignity flying through. We shouldn't be arguing for basics. However, we also need to think of how to move the country forward, and I think the young ones might do a better job than many of us have in trying to bring the sanity that the Middle East urgently needs.
Jon Alterman: Bader Al-Saif, thank you very much for joining us on Babel.
Bader Al-Saif: Thank you, Jon.

I’m often asked, “what is the New Orleans sound?” It may seem like a simple question to answer, but it isn’t. Jazz was invented in New Orleans, and many believe it is the birthplace of American music with ingredient sounds from Africa, the Caribbean, and Europe. The music of New Orleans is the DNA of rock and roll, and it’s one of the places where the blues evolved. I could talk about the roux of roots music coming from New Orleans all day long. It’s a place where artists as diverse as Mahalia Jackson, Jimmy Buffet, Louis Armstrong, Fats Domino, Little Richard, Sidney Bechet, Dr. John, the Meters, the Neville Brothers, Bobby Charles (“See Ya Later Alligator”), and the Radiators have existed—many of them as contemporaries. And if I were to list all the artists the world over that have been inspired by New Orleans music, it would be almost endless.

So, when I’m asked about the Crescent City sound, I usually start by saying, “It’s a joyful noise.” The sound takes on many forms and one of the cool things New Orleans musicians often do is interpret other artists’ songs and rework them with their own lagniappe. This clip of Galactic featuring Anjelika “Jelly” Joseph performing last weekend in Brooklyn is a terrific example of a well-known New Orleans band taking a rock and roll classic and adding a bit of a Big Easy interpretation. By the way, the excellent bass player bouncing around is Bethesda, Maryland native Rob Mercurio who was my sister’s classmate at Tulane—super cool guy."
72,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-will-united-states-do-after-drone-strike-jordan,Jon B. Alterman,"January 29, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"Audio Brief
A short, spoken-word summary from CSIS’s Jon B. Alterman on his commentary, “What Will the United States Do after the Drone Strike in Jordan?” On January 28, a drone reportedly piloted by forces connected to Iran killed three U.S. troops at a base in northeast Jordan and wounded more than two dozen more. The strike is the highest casualty event the United States has had in the Middle East in more than a decade.
Q1: What prompted this strike?
A1: The strike did not come out of the blue. Iranian-linked forces have launched more than 150 attacks on U.S. forces since October 17, and U.S. officials considered it only a matter of time before service members died. Iran has funded, trained, and equipped an “axis of resistance” in the Middle East that includes Hamas, which has been seeking to capitalize on the Gaza war to increase pressure on the United States. The long-term goal of these efforts is to push the United States from the region. It seeks to do so partly by increasing regional hostility to the U.S. presence and partly by increasing the U.S. costs of that presence.
Q2: How will the United States respond?
A2: While the United States is likely to carry out military strikes, it is unlikely to change the military situation in the Middle East dramatically, or to change the calculus of Iran or its proxies.
After all, previous U.S. efforts to deter Iranian proxies have failed. Just last week, U.S. forces responded to attacks on the Al-Asad airbase in Iraq with strikes on three sites connected to Iranian-linked forces in the country, and it has conducted more than a week of strikes on Yemen’s Houthi rebels, whose attacks threaten Red Sea shipping lanes.
U.S. Defense Department statements after the U.S. strikes have referred to them as “necessary” and “proportionate,” which is a way of signaling that they comply with international law. Even so, international support for the U.S. use of force has been sparse, even from NATO members such as France and Italy.
Thus far, Biden has personally directed the deliberate strikes in Iraq and Yemen. This is because the strategic goal in the White House is preventing a spiral toward a wider war that would have no immediate goal or endpoint. Yet, that caution could undermine U.S. deterrence, as targets can calculate the risks of their actions with some precision. While the U.S. military has developed a long list of Iranian-aligned targets in Iraq and Syria (and even Iran) that it can choose from, it will refrain from hitting targets that it thinks risk eliciting a wide-scale response.
Q3: Will the United States stumble into a war anyway?
A3: While the odds of wider-scale violence have ticked up, a broad regional war remains unlikely. Instead, both sides are likely to probe to discover each other’s redlines, creating a steadier beat of reciprocal violence over the coming months rather than a sudden eruption.
While some sort of U.S. military action this week can be expected, the prospect of the United States brokering another temporary ceasefire in Gaza will remain the main focus of White House efforts. An agreement in Gaza would lower the regional temperature, rebuild cooperation with U.S. allies in the region, and put some wind in the sails of U.S. diplomacy. Even so, it won’t do much to leaven other bad national security news: Ukraine funding seems increasingly imperiled in Congress, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan’s meetings with a senior Chinese official seemed not to produce much cooperation on Middle East issues, and Iran seems emboldened because its strategy of not seeking accommodation with the United States and other Western powers is paying dividends.

73,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/can-regional-war-be-avoided-middle-east,Daniel Byman and Seth G. Jones,"January 17, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"The U.S. strikes on the Houthi rebels in Yemen show that the war that began after Hamas launched a brutal terrorist attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, is now a regional conflict. Regional actors, including Iran and the Houthis, want to demonstrate solidarity with Hamas and gain credibility with their constituencies for being part of the anti-Israel struggle. At the same time, however, Iran wants to avoid an all-out war with Israel and the United States. But the actions of both sides might accidentally spin out of control.
Deterring a regional war will be a challenge for the United States and require restraint on Israel’s part. Thomas Schelling, the U.S. foreign policy strategist and Nobel Prize-winning economist, argued that deterrence rests, in part, on the threat of inflicting more pain—what he called “latent violence.” This approach entails the United States using calibrated force against Iranian-backed groups in Yemen, Iraq, and Syria, signaling that it is prepared to use more force if necessary, and then following up if it is required.
The threat of latent violence is particularly important to send to Iran. Over the past decade, Iran and its paramilitary arm, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)-Quds Force, have strengthened their relationships with partner forces in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Gaza, the West Bank, and other areas in the region. Since October 7, the head of the Quds Force, Esmail Qaani, has promised to support Hamas in an “axis of resistance” and visited Iranian-backed groups in Syria and Iraq.
Israel’s deadliest foe is Lebanese Hezbollah. The risk of an all-out war with Hezbollah has loomed since October 7. Since that date, Hezbollah and various Palestinian groups it controls have attacked Israel more than 200 times, while Israel has struck over 1,200 targets in Lebanon. Twelve Israelis have died, and Hezbollah reports it has lost around 150 fighters from the attacks and Israeli strikes have killed 20 Lebanese civilians. Israel has also struck Hezbollah commanders and senior Hamas figures in Lebanon. A member of the country’s war cabinet warned that if there is no diplomatic solution soon, Israel’s military will act decisively.
Israel and Hezbollah clashed in 2006 in a 34-day war that left both sides reeling, with at least 157 Israeli dead, perhaps 500–700 Hezbollah fighters killed, and as many as 2,000 Lebanese civilians dead. The hostilities ended with UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which called for the Lebanese state, not Hezbollah, to assert control of the border area.
Since the war, however, Hezbollah has deployed its forces to the border, at times disguising its operatives as members of a fake NGO, Green Without Borders, to infiltrate the area. Hezbollah forces include several thousand elite “Radwan” fighters that have trained for cross-border attacks on Israel. Hezbollah has also built a massive rocket arsenal, estimated at 150,000, which includes some precision-guided systems. Although Iron Dome and other Israeli missile defense systems have proven effective against limited numbers of rockets, Hezbollah could overwhelm these systems with massive salvos.
Despite Hamas’s wishes, the October 7 attack did not signal the beginning of an all-out regional war against Israel. Hezbollah, unlike Hamas, cares about its constituents and fears a repeat of 2006. With its attacks, Hezbollah seeks to show solidarity with Hamas, not launch a broader conflict, and has carefully selected targets (and used Palestinian proxies for any cross-border infiltration). Israeli officials told us that they recognize Hezbollah has, for now, selected its targets with care to avoid escalation to all-out war.
Fearing a Hezbollah attack, Israel evacuated dozens of towns near the border, including over 80,000 Israelis. For now, Israel has bolstered its military forces in the north, but many of these are reservists, and Israel cannot mobilize them for long without tremendous harm to its economy. It must also eventually convince residents to return to their homes.
The potential for an expanding war includes Israel’s other northern neighbor, Syria. Iran and Hezbollah came to the regime’s rescue when it neared collapse after it descended into civil war in 2011, and now both have a greater presence on the Israel border. Israel at times launches strikes on Iranian Quds Force officers and other Iranian assets in Syria.
Iranian-backed groups have also used drones to attack U.S. forces based at al-Tanf, along the Jordanian border, and at the Conoco gas field in eastern Syria. These attacks have injured dozens of Americans, leading the United States to target Quds Force infrastructure in Syria. U.S. officials claim there is “very clear messaging through multiple channels. And the message is, to Iranian senior leaders, ‘We want you to direct your proxies and militia groups to stop attacking us.’” Yet the attacks continue.
One of the post-October 7 surprises is the emergence of a new player in the Israel-Palestinian dispute: the Houthis in Yemen. The Houthis, a rebel group, are the de facto government of much of Yemen. The Houthis have fought in a civil war for almost a decade, with almost 400,000 people dying and regional powers like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates trying, unsuccessfully, to counter them. Their unsubtle motto is “God is the Greatest, Death to America, Death to Israel, A Curse Upon the Jews, Victory to Islam.” They have limited support in Yemen and rule brutally there, but now they are basking in the admiration of many Yemenis and much of the Arab world for their anti-Israel actions. Iran backs the Houthis, providing them with weapons and training, but it does not control them.
Since October 7, the Houthis have attacked shipping in the Bab el-Mandab Strait as well as launched missiles at Israel, most of which U.S. forces intercepted. The attacks, however, have convinced major shipping companies to avoid the area, a blow to the economies of Egypt and Jordan as well as Israel, and increasing the overall costs of shipping throughout the world.
The United States has formed an international task force with Bahrain, Canada, France, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom, in addition to using U.S. Navy vessels to counter Houthi attacks. The recent U.S. attacks on Houthi targets, which struck drone and missile sites, radars, and weapons storage areas, were designed to send a message to the Houthis rather than initiate a larger struggle. But the Houthis still retain significant offense capabilities and will likely continue to fire missiles and drones at ships transiting the Red Sea.
While the attacks in Yemen, Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria since October 7 are concerning, they have largely been contained to low-level artillery, rocket, air, and drone strikes, with only limited infrastructure damage and casualties. But escalation to full-scale war is possible and would throw the region into turmoil.
The challenge for the United States will be to deter Iran and its partner forces from escalating the conflict into a regional war by adopting a calibrated use of force today and indicating that it has the capability and will to use additional force if necessary in the future. Of particular importance is signaling that the United States is prepared to strike—and continue to strike—targets of value to Iran and its partners in the region, such as military bases, weapons depots, arms production facilities, command and control centers, and training locations.
In Yemen, the United States should adopt a firmer response to the Houthis, including increased attacks against Houthi infrastructure, as long as Houthi attacks persist. The United States should also adopt a tougher approach to Iranian-backed groups in Syria and Iraq if attacks continue against the United States, Israel, and other international targets. In Lebanon, the United States should push for much more effective implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, especially near the Israel border.
The United States also needs to convince Israel to avoid escalating the war, particularly against Hezbollah. Another war in Lebanon would lead other Iranian proxies to increase attacks on U.S. forces, making it hard for the United States to avoid being sucked into a far more massive conflict. So far, the Biden administration has successfully convinced Israel not to escalate, and stronger U.S. actions against various Iranian proxies like the Houthis will help convince Israelis that the United States stands behind them.
Washington should also convince Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza and reduce the intensity of operations to lower the death toll among Palestinian civilians. Both of these will reduce (though hardly end) the anti-Israel outrage that feeds militant groups in the Middle East.
Adopting this approach will require deft diplomacy and the continuing deployment of some U.S. military assets in the Middle East, including at least one carrier strike group. A U.S. carrier strike group has significant capabilities that can be used across the Middle East, such as missiles for long-range strike, air defense, fighter aircraft, and intelligence collection.
Deterrence rests, in part, on the credible threat of more pain. These actions will not guarantee that a regional war will be averted. But they should impact the cost-benefit calculations of Iran and its partners and make it clear that a regional war will be devastating—and that is a big step forward in effective deterrence.

75,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/ground-israel-expert-perspectives,Unknown,"January 17, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"This transcript is from a CSIS event hosted on January 17, 2024. Watch the full video here.
Seth G. Jones: Welcome to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. I wanted to begin by noting that this is a discussion from an on-the-ground trip that several of my colleagues that I’m going to be discussing today made to Israel in December of 2023, including to the area right around Gaza, several kibbutzim – Be’eri you can see on the map, and Nir Oz.
And I’m joined in the studio here by Dr. Eliot Cohen. Eliot is the Arleigh Burke chair in strategy at CSIS and former counselor at the State Department. And then Mara Rudman is former deputy assistant to the president for national security affairs in the Clinton and Obama administrations, and an expert on the Middle East. Welcome to both of you.
Eliot A. Cohen: Well, thank you.
Mara Rudman: Thank you.
Dr. Jones: Eliot, let me start with you. Can you tell us a little bit about the trip, its purpose, the places you visited? Then we’ll get into more details about – for both of you – about what your key takeaways were, and then, you know, we’ve got a lot of stuff to cover – Iran, West Bank, the northern borders.
Dr. Cohen: Sure. So in the context of an exchange with some senior Israeli official in their Foreign Ministry, he asked if I’d be willing to bring a delegation of military and national security experts to Israel. We began the discussion in the fall, probably about – a few weeks after the October 7th attack. We raised the funding independently, so we were not funded in any way by the Israeli government, and I put together a small group. Core of it was CSIS, so you were with us. I was there; my friend Dan Byman, Mara Rudman of course, a couple of other experts. And we had about eight days on the ground in both Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, meeting with a lot of military/intelligence officials, journalists, one very senior politician in the Knesset. And then we had two field trips – two long field trips – one, as you pointed out in your introduction, to Kibbutz Be’eri and Kibbutz Nir Oz. These are two kibbutzim which were overrun on October 7th. Nir Oz lost about a hundred of its 400 inhabitants. And we also went to a weapons display and things like that. And then we had another day where we went along the northern border with Lebanon and went all the way up to the corner of the Golan Heights, so we got a view there. So we were both out in the field and engaged in really intensive conversations.
Dr. Jones: And also spoke to U.S. officials, too, while there.
Dr. Cohen: And we spoke with the – absolutely. We spoke with Ambassador Jack Lew. And so it was – it was a very, very intense trip.
Dr. Jones: Anything else on the purpose or the specifics of the trip, Mara?
Ms. Rudman: Sure. I guess what I would look at was the opportunity to see the magnitude of the challenge that Israelis and Palestinians are facing and the extent to which and I would say – and I would put this in the security context that the ability to pursue the Hamas attack and not dehumanize an entire population being Palestinians and on the Palestinian side recognizing why Israeli security demands going after Hamas without equating all Israelis with trying to do in all Palestinians, and to get to secure outcomes in the region it’s going to be pretty critical to get through that kind of psychological passage for both peoples.
Dr. Jones: Yeah. You know, interesting in talking to individuals to understand their psychology and there was a level of trauma that we certainly saw on the ground.
So let’s start first with you, Eliot, and then we’ll go to Mara. What were the primary takeaways from the trip?
Dr. Cohen: So, yeah. The first top line really is what you just alluded to. This is a traumatized society. I mean, you could see it from the moment you arrived at Ben Gurion Airport where there are pictures of the hostages everywhere and when you check in at the hotel. There’s a different level of trauma, I felt, for the military and intelligence leaders, many of whom I’ve known for a long time, who are really wracked by a sense of guilt and shame and rage at their own system.
I mean, they – I think they – there’s a feeling of having broken the contract with the people of Israel. I also think, you know, the level of trauma is something that’s really palpable when you’re over there. I’ve suggested to people that if you want to get a sense of what this was like imagine it happening in the United States and multiply every number by 30. So it would be the equivalent of having had a dozen, maybe 15, 9/11s in a single day.
It would be the equivalent of having 36(,000), maybe 40,000 people massacred in a single day, 6,000 of them soldiers. It would be the equivalent of having 7,000 people taken hostage, several thousand women raped.
I mean, it is a monumental trauma and it’s been reinforced, I think, by the visuals that many Israelis have seen although many of us have not seen. Most of us sat through a video that the Israelis have put together. No commentary on it, just subtitles translating various remarks of – from body cams and dash cams and closed circuit TV and then personal mobile phones of both perpetrators and victims, and one of the things that’s particularly horrifying is the extent to which Hamas operatives were very deliberately photographing some of the most brutal things imaginable and doing that very deliberately.
So that was a – just watching that film was traumatic. Of course, very different from experiencing it. So I think that’s really the – sort of the first takeaway.
The second takeaway I would offer is I think we all learned about the systematic nature of the Hamas attack, how carefully planned, how ambitious, even more ambitious than I think most of us had realized before we went over, how well thought out, how good their intelligence was about various weak points in the Israeli security system and how deliberate it all was. This wasn’t a, you know, that they got lucky in some sense. This was a massacre which could have been, extraordinarily enough, even worse.
Dr. Jones: One issue before we go to Mara, just because you mentioned it, is if we can pull up some of the comparative data just to understand where this attack sits in Israeli history – the five deadliest terrorist attacks in Israeli history this is by far the largest, and also when we look at the eight deadliest terrorist attacks by number of fatalities per capita it’s actually striking that as we pulled up attacks in Iraq, Somalia, Lebanon, Central African Republic, and then Iraq again the number of individuals killed on a per capita basis was actually quite large.
So turning to you, Mara, what – I mean, what were the primary takeaways that you had over the course of the trip?
Ms. Rudman: I think that the, certainly, scope and scale of what happened. My footnote or two-finger on Eliot’s point about kind of multiplying numbers from 9/11, I don’t think this was your intention, Eliot, but I actually think the ways in which it was, it hit on a different, and much closer, and more personal level than 9/11. And I say that with huge awareness of the trauma that 9/11 was for the country as a whole and for people who were related to those who were killed and suffered there. But I say this because it was absolutely up close. It was not just having cameras, but it was very personal, and it was meant to be very personal, to go into people’s homes, to rape and kill and mutilate, and to show that you have the capacity to do that. And I’ll use, again, a word I used, and the lack of humanity to do that. And then, take that and multiply those numbers out.
I think all those are – go to some of the depth of trauma, the sense of an invasion in all possible ways, and a way in which what had been something of a myth of Israel’s might and kind of all-seeing ability to protect – you talked about contract with its people. I would say it went even beyond that, because throughout the region, and I’d say in the world, there is a perception of Israeli intelligence, of Israeli security, which this, you know, band of militia – what you call militia, military – but a nonstate actor that could come together over a period of years and put together this kind of attack obviously requires not just soul searching in Israel but figuring out how things went wrong, and the people who are responsible for both figuring that out, and assessing, and figuring out how to correct, are the same people who are trying to fight the conflict now. And that, in itself, poses huge challenges.
I don’t think we can underscore the extent to which, as Eliot said, Hamas was methodical, was strategic, put in a lot of time and energy and effort in this planning. And it meant that Israel had a lot of time to understand what was going on and to see. And whether they relied on technology and not human intelligence, whether they – I would say, some of the top Israeli leaders, political and military, lost the ability to know their adversary, which is a huge component of being able to defeat or manage or anything else a conflict. And their adversary knew them a lot better than they knew their adversary.
Dr. Cohen: Actually, if I could just jump in on that. You’re completely right about all those things, including the point about 9/11. This is really personal for every Israeli. One way or another, everybody has been touched by this. The one thing I just might qualify a little bit in my turn would be Hamas is – it may not be formally a state, but they have state-like capabilities. So this is – you know, it’s a military that’s organized, five brigades, you know, 24 battalions.
Watching that video, which includes particularly the lead Nukhba forces, which were the first wave. Seth, you should speak to this too, because you’ve actually had a lot of – a lot more time than I’ve had on the ground in Afghanistan and places like that. They moved very professionally. They exercised good fire discipline. They were extremely well equipped. They were – they were acting as a somewhat state-like military, backed by – then by a less-disciplined kind of infantry, and then by mobs that came out of Gaza to, you know, further plunder, and rape, and kill.
And I think that there’s a large lesson for us in this because, you know, one of the themes I think we talked about together on the trip is the issue is not just – the issue goes well beyond the Middle East. I mean, you’ve had in this case, as you had in Russia-Ukraine, a military that is pretty formally organized and kind of looks like a military which is very deliberately using terrorizing a civilian population, to include sexual violence. And I think that’s something we –you know, we have to talk about. You know, it rose to the surface during the Bosnian war, but people don’t talk enough about it. As a – it is a deliberate tool of war. And it’s hideous, but it’s entirely calculated.
Ms. Rudman: As is locating your forces under hospitals and mosques and schools. So one side is obligated to follow the laws of armed conflict and the other side not only doesn’t use them, but flouts them quite strategically.
Dr. Cohen: Very deliberately, yes.
Dr. Jones: You know, it was – there were a couple of things that were interesting to me along these lines. One is I think I had a – I had understood to some degree the intelligence failures in identifying what was going on, and there were a range of reasons for that. What I had not fully appreciated is the failure of the Israeli Defense Forces to respond once the attack started. And there was one moment as we were walking around Nir Oz by someone who had survived the attack, and when he talked through the initial breaches of the kibbutz at several gates, and seven-and-a-half hours later the IDF shows up to a kibbutz that lost a quarter of its population. And we had just driven there. I mean, I had been down to that area before. But it was about an hour drive or so. And the reality is it took the Israeli Defense Forces a long time to respond to that. So it was more than just a general intelligence failure.
Ms. Rudman: And you could hear, by the way, in his voice the broken contract.
Dr. Jones: And you could hear in his voice.
Ms. Rudman: The point that you made.
Dr. Cohen: Yeah. Yeah.
Dr. Jones: Yeah. And they were – people from the kibbutz that we spoke to in front of IDF soldiers taking us around were clear that their military failed them.
Dr. Cohen: You know, I think the thing is that the context in some ways is not previous terror attacks; the context in some ways, for a lot of Israelis, is 1973. But this is much worse than 1973. This was an attack on the civilian population, where ’73 wasn’t. It was an attack on, you know, pre-’67 Israel, which 1973 wasn’t. You know, 1973 got turned around within a couple of weeks. This is not really turned around. And it is a multilevel failure. And you know, we could go on for great length. It was a political failure. There’s a strategic failure. There’s an operational failure. There’s an organizational failure. There are tactical failures. And so I think this is – I really do believe this is probably the most traumatic event in Israeli history. It’s transforming the country.
Now, the one thing I would say that I think we – at least I felt, and I’d be curious what the two of you felt, I mean, you also saw a lot of resilience and kind of a very – and this is very typical of Israeli military history, of kind of a quick – very quick recovery, you know, civil society mobilizes, you know, people adapt to the new circumstances and are creative and innovative and all the rest. But there’s also behind that a deeper societal resilience, so that has to be pointed out as well. But it is a comprehensive failure, and the Israelis will be processing this for a long time.
Ms. Rudman: I think it’s worth, though, digging further. I agree with you on the resilience point, but I also think some of the challenges and lack of readiness on the military side to deal with this implicate the, yes, resilient, but also having to adapt on the fly, and concerned me some in how the war is being pursued against Hamas and the ability to make those judgments.
So I think it’s worth unpacking a little bit, Seth. I mean, to me it was striking that, for example, clearly West Bank was prioritized over Gaza for a period of years – that major numbers of forces were moved to West Bank from Gaza, and then, for budgetary reasons, that, you know, three separate components of the Gaza command were all stationed together in the same place. So just kind of some basic stuff that made it incredibly difficult. And no prior planning, no wargaming on a potential invasion of Israel.
Dr. Cohen: I mean, there are a number of just amazing lapses. Like, so the Israelis shut down their open-source intelligence operation that was focused on Gaza; in other words, looking at television and things like that. Well, there had been a television series which – I think it was called “Fist of Fury” or something like that, which was basically a – you know, not docu-drama, but something like that of an attack like this. And Yahya Sinwar – so the guy who’s in charge for Hamas in Gaza – gave the director of this thing a big award; said, yes, this is exactly what we’re going to do. You know? And nobody really particularly paid attention to that.
Dr. Jones: Yeah. When I was in Israel in August, the focus was both in the West Bank – the Israelis were conducting operations including against Hamas in Jenin, as well as deep concern about Hezbollah crossing the border up north. Not on Gaza, where – this does raise broader questions about to what degree the Israelis also overstated their abilities to deter Hamas in –
Ms. Rudman: I don’t think there are questions. I think they did, hugely, because they didn’t know their adversary.
Dr. Jones: Yeah.
Dr. Cohen: And I think that they felt that they – I think at political level, they felt they had the solution. The solution was Qatari money flowing into the Gaza Strip which, remember, the Israelis wanted –
Ms. Rudman: And facilitated.
Dr. Cohen: And facilitated. Having, I think, was it, 19,000 workers from Gaza, and they were increasing the number of permits. Now, a lot of those people were actually working in some of these settlements on the border of the Gaza Strip. And the Israelis, at least, were convinced that they were providing very fine-grained intelligence about security systems, and who was in what house, and that sort of thing. But I think the main thing is that they felt that they had kind of a political strategic solution to include, you know, periodically punitive strikes when somebody fired missiles from the Gaza Strip.
Dr. Jones: Yeah.
Ms. Rudman: But can I – just on one of those points, though, I agree with you, Eliot, but I also think it shows the degree of lack of understanding. That, I mean, from my kind of pretty basic knowledge of Palestinian – knowing Palestinians who have lived in Gaza, are still living there in the current circumstances, if you give Hamas however many work permits, and they have the ability to control – and they will, whether or not the PA is nominally in charge – who gets those, they’re going to demand something for it.
So it should have been factored in that there was intel being provided, and not because it means that all the people – and this, I think, is an important point for people to understand. Not because all the workers coming in are Hamas people. But to be able to provide food for their families, to be able to go back and forth, there’s a price to pay under a ruling authority like Hamas.
Dr. Cohen: Of course. Absolutely.
Dr. Jones: So before we leave Gaza, I do want to turn actually to Gaza itself in a second. But I also want to pull up some of the images that came from the visits to the Gaza border on the Israeli side.
Ms. Rudman: Those are all Nir Oz.
Dr. Jones: Yeah. What struck you as you look – as you look at these? So we’ve got a – I think it was a kindergarten in the upper left corner, some of the destruction lower left. This was a dining facility. And then, Mara, what struck you about the – this is – these are mailboxes in the upper right?
Ms. Rudman: So the dining facility – and it was the community grounds on which the mailboxes also existed – was itself attacked. There were bullet holes in the door. The kitchen, I think, had been burned. No one had been inside the facility at the time. But then what the kibbutz has done, some of the kibbutzniks who survived, basically made this display. So the tables that you see in this picture are set for dinner with – and I get chills literally now just looking at the photo – it took up about 25 percent of the dining area. And those are tables of people who were killed or hostages.
Dr. Cohen: Yeah, by family.
Ms. Rudman: By family, exactly. And so that – we had kind of walked around to look at those. The mailboxes have marks of – so it’s the total universe of mailboxes for the kibbutz. And the red are people who were killed. And you can’t really see in this picture, but there’s both black and another dark color, that the black are people who are current – were at the time, mid-December, currently hostages. And the other slightly different color were people who were returned hostages. One of whom we saw while we were there. An older woman who had just come back a few days before and has since written quite an eloquent piece in The New York Times, that I’d commend to people for her view.
Dr. Jones: So, first to Eliot on Gaza, your sense of the military operation so far, what the Israelis have accomplished, what they haven’t. And then, Mara, your perspective too on the Palestinian side. Because, you know, the numbers are pretty significant right now also of Palestinians that have been killed or wounded. So where are the Israelis at right now, and?
Dr. Cohen: Yeah. So I think we may have somewhat different perspectives on this. You know, I look at this from the perspective of military history, which is where I start from. The Israelis are going into a very densely urbanized area, which is even more thoroughly fortified than they had realized. There was just a piece in The New York Times about this, that it turned out the tunnels systems were – we’re now talking, like, 350 miles of tunnels. But they’re not just tunnels. They’re bunkers. And, I think, 5,000 shafts to exit them. It’s quite extraordinary.
And, you know, they’ve been going in. And this is kind of a grinding, attritional battle. I think from a military, technical point of view – and, you know, you also should give your judgement on this, I think – they’ve actually done pretty well. I mean, they – you know, urban warfare is notoriously the most costly, both for the soldiers fighting in it, but also for the civilians. Like one marker I would just put down for everybody to think about, in February of 1945, we liberated Manilla, which was a friendly city, from the Japanese. And 100,000 Filipino civilians died in that. And, you know, you can talk about other urban battles of World War II. That’s not out of line.
The one other thing I’ll say, just on the Palestinian casualty issue, the Palestinians – let’s assume that their numbers are correct. The Palestinian numbers don’t distinguish between fighters and civilians. And the Israeli estimate – and I have no idea if this is accurate or not – is that they’ve killed about 9,000 Hamas combatants. Maybe. I don’t know. But my guess is some proportion of those are that. But there’s no question that I think Palestinian civilians have been suffering a lot during this.
I guess my feeling is I don’t know any other way that it could have been done. I don’t think the Israelis – I think the Israeli rules of engagement are probably laxer. I’m sure they are more lax than they were in previous operations. But I also, from everything I’d read, I think they’re within the law of armed conflict, which is actually pretty permissive about what you can do. And I think the Israelis are showing their usual kind of innovativeness, technologically as well as tactically. The question is, where does it lead? I mean, that’s the old strategic question.
Ms. Rudman: Because for law of armed conflict, you need means to meet ends.
Dr. Cohen: Yeah. So I think where they’re going to end up, if I had to guess, I think they have really severely damaged Hamas. I don’t think there’s any doubt about that. I think they will eventually get the Hamas leadership. I think that’s only a matter of time, because one of the things that happens is armed forces come into contact, you generate more information, as they have because they’re capturing people who talk, and they’re capturing computers, and phones, and things of that – of that kind. But will they be able to completely eliminate Hamas as a movement? I don’t really – I don’t really think so.
Dr. Jones: No. I’ll jump in categorically. They will not.
Dr. Cohen: Right. But I think that – what I think will happen – and I’m very cautious about this, so all kinds of caveats. I think they will eventually get Sinwar and his key deputies – Marwan Issa, Mohammed Deif – and that will allow them, in a way, to kind of declare victory and pull back. But I think the future of Gaza is going to look something like this: First, the Israelis will fortify that border. You know, it’ll be minefields and it’ll be kind of like the DMZ in North Korea. I think they will – they may have a pause in the fighting with Hamas, if there’s a prisoner exchange, but there will be no ceasefire. So if they get what they think is a legitimate shot at Hamas operatives training, or certainly at leaders, they will take it going forward. And this is, I think, now going to be war to the death. It’s not – they’re not going back to anything previous.
And the problem is going to be, what do you do about the administration of the Gaza – of the Gaza Strip? And I think that’s a – I’d be curious to know how the two of you think that that can play out. I just don’t – I don’t see any good solution. I don’t think the UAE is going to want to run it, or Saudi Arabia, or Egypt, or Sweden, Finland, the EU. The U.N. certainly can’t do it. The Israelis don’t want to do it. If I had to guess what the Israelis will end up doing quietly, with the help of some of the Arab states who have not broken relations with them – which is quite interesting, actually, I think – they will cut deals with local clans to the extent they still exist. There will be kind of a Palestinian Authority fig leaf of some kind. The Egyptians and Emiratis will be there in the background. But it’s going to be a messy, messy situation.
Dr. Jones: All right, Mara, over to you.
Ms. Rudman: So that’s not a sustainable outcome, at all. And so I share your view and sense, without, obviously, the depth that you have on military history and on how brutal this kind of conflict is for civilians, and that what is happening now is not unlike what has happened historically in situations where I would say, as with here, the country going in and the country taking the action is well justified in the action it’s taking. I think what’s hard is for both the country going in – in this case, Israel – and the international community to figure out what the objectives are and what their interests actually are, and not have the immediate – the immediate blind them to the – to the longer term. And that’s what I fear right now, Eliot. And I fear it, frankly, in some of what your response is, because it’s 2 million people who are living in Gaza. And if the goal is to eliminate Hamas and you execute in this fashion the conflict going forward for an indeterminable period of time, you are not going to achieve your objective. You –
Dr. Cohen: I didn’t – I didn’t say they would. All I was trying to say, what is – you know, Seth, you asked me what do you think is going to happen. That’s what I think is going to happen, because I don’t hear a plausible alternative story that I can imagine the Israelis or anybody else buying into.
Ms. Rudman: So I actually think that the alternative approach does involve moving towards bringing the West Bank and Gaza together, having a whatever you call it, the structure that was the Palestinian Authority significantly revamped. I do not think you’re going to get the kind of investment from countries in the region without doing that and without having a trajectory to doing that.
I fully appreciate that that is not possible, as I see it, with the current coalition in charge in Israel. And I think that that coalition will change. I think the question is when. And I think it’s important to discuss there’s a direct internal conflict for Prime Minister Netanyahu in his own personal political gains, and which, frankly, includes having this conflict go on for an extended period, and finding a way to pivot to another phase, which I actually thought was beginning with the targeted killing in Beirut of the West Bank commander, who had been a nexus point between Iran and the Gaza military leadership. But I believe that the conflict, while I agree that there should not be a ceasefire per se, needs to move to a much more strategic and targeted approach. There needs to be conscious effort – whether Israel wants responsibility for Gaza or not, they have that responsibility. It’s not an option for them to walk away from the 2 million Palestinians that are living in Gaza, just in the same way they share responsibility for what’s happening in the West Bank. And so part of that is how – what’s the most effective way to execute on that, and that is working with others who may not share the exact same viewpoint you have but that gets to some kind of approach that is more effective, ultimately, in guaranteeing the security of Israel than the path that they’re on.
Dr. Cohen: Again, I want to be very clear. I’m talking about what I think is likely. You know, what would be desirable, there are all kinds of things that would be desirable. And I guess, you know, part of my deep skepticism is a deep skepticism about the Palestinian Authority and the legitimacy of the Palestinian Authority in the Palestinian world. You know, in the West Bank, Hamas is actually very popular right now, you know? I don’t know what an alternative to the PA would be, but I’m not sure that PA is going to reform itself. And I don’t think, I mean, given how badly they’ve done in the West Bank, the idea that they would be able to effectively run Gaza, I just don’t see it. I mean, I wish I could agree with you.
Ms. Rudman: But my problem, Eliot, with how you’re talking is that it’s as if all of this is occurring in a vacuum, that the PA on its own managed to be so horrendous, that the Palestinian people are not movable in the same way, frankly, a major portion of the Israeli people – we’ve seen over years that populations in the middle – it’s true in this country, too – can wildly swing back and forth depending on what options are given them and how they move forward. So no one is an island in this context, and I think it’s a mistake to talk and think about it as an island.
Dr. Jones: So one question along these lines, Mara, for you first is what’s the role the United States should play in all this including actually more broadly kind of the – a two-state solution discussion? What’s the role of the U.S. in this and what should the U.S. play?
Ms. Rudman: I’m of the view that here as in many other places the United States’ role is as an indispensable partner and that’s an ability to bring people together. I would say, first of all, it’s a mistake to start any kind of discussions, negotiations, about two states now but it is in helping to figure out how you align the parties to get on a pathway towards that as being in everyone’s security interest.
You know, you can talk about values down the road. I think to me this is about immediate security, addressing what’s sustainable in the region, and for the United States it’s in the United States’ interest to do that because we clearly need a stable and secure Middle East and we need to not have room for China and Russia to play the roles that they’re already starting – they have been playing for some time and to have that grow further.
And so for the United States it is clearly worth the investment of our time and energy and resources to move things in that direction.
Dr. Jones: So I want to take one of the issues you just raised, kind of the broader Middle East, and move us to the north. One of the areas visited during the trip was of the Israeli border with Lebanon. So if we can pull up the slides. We’ve got a range of outposts here and then I do want to start, Eliot, with you with a photograph from the trip. So what are we looking at here?
And then for both of you, you know, there certainly is a lot of concern. We do see skirmishes already at that border. What is your concern about sort of the broader spread of violence? But let’s start with what we’re looking at first.
Dr. Cohen: So what we’re looking at here is this is Israel. That’s basically the forested part, and the more barren part that’s Lebanon. So this is the one section of the border where the Lebanese have the high ground and the Israelis are on somewhat lower ground. If you go further west the Israelis are on the high ground.
What you’ve been seeing this – you know, Hezbollah initiated this immediately after October 7th so it’s not they were provoked into this – is, you know, continual exchanges of fire. On the whole, both sides have been – tried to be restrained about not going after civilian targets for the most part, although civilians on both sides have been killed, but it’s – we went up there. It is – I doubt actually we’d be able to go to some of the places we went now.
There’s shooting that’s going on to a depth of, like, five kilometers or seven. In fact, the Israelis have evacuated their northern border to get a depth of about five to seven kilometers, same as in the Gaza Strip. So, you know, another dimension of this to remember is the Israelis now have an internally displaced persons population of about 200,000.
Again, apply the rule of 30. That’d be like having 6 million displaced Americans. The thing that is, I think, really striking actually is the previous map, if I could – if you could just pull that back up.
Dr. Jones: Yeah, if we go back to that.
Dr. Cohen: You know, all those outposts. When we talk to Israeli military planners their basic point is, look, if you look at the structure of Hezbollah forces it’s like Hamas only better. They’re better armed. They have this – instead of the Nukhba, which were the kind of elite light infantry, you have the Radwan, who probably helped train them, by the way.
They’re better equipped and they are all along the border, and the concept of operations is essentially the same. That is to say, at some point you have a simultaneous attack on the border kibbutzim and you take hostages and you pull back, and the tunnel networks and so on are even deeper and more extensive and harder to get at because they’re in rock rather than the softer soil of Gaza.
And, of course, this is in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701. Hezbollah is supposed to be behind the Litani River. What does all this mean?
Ms. Rudman: Which is the faint blue line that’s there.
Dr. Cohen: Yeah. So what does all that – there you go. There’s the Litani River. So they – Hezbollah is supposed to be behind that. So what does all that mean?
First, there is a continual low-level – this would be headline news if it wasn’t for what’s going on in Gaza. There is continual fighting that’s going on up there. It sort of escalates around the edges.
But I think the main thing to understand is, from the Israeli point of view, one of the lessons that they’ve learned is they cannot count on strategic early warning. You know, that was a critical part of their defense concept for a very long time. Well, that’s gone away and they no longer believe in it. So I think the chances of them – and I think they just think they’re not going to go through that again or anything remotely like it. So I think the chances of a serious war in Lebanon are quite high. Whether it's likely or not I don’t know, but there – enough Israelis that we talked to were thinking quite seriously about that. That’s, by the way, another reason why I’m more pessimistic than you are, Mara, about the possibilities, because I think we could be walking into an extended war on Israel’s borders if they end up doing this, and some Israeli leaders are talking about it.
By the way, I’ll – just as long as I have the floor I’ll say one other thing, which is I completely agree with you about the problems of this Israeli government. And I think it is – I mean, they’re in a terribly difficult situation, but I think this government in particular finds it almost impossible to think strategically. And you know, I very much agree that if you had a different cast of characters – none of whom would be softies, let me say –
Ms. Rudman: Well, if you had the War Cabinet and not –
Dr. Cohen: You’d have a – if you had a real War Cabinet, you know, they’d be able to wrestle with these problems, I think, better than what you got – then what you got now. But that, I think, is the –
Dr. Jones: Well, one of the things – before I go to Mara, what is interesting – at least what I heard repeatedly on the Iranians, because the Iranians haven’t come up – was, one, the Iranians were likely surprised by the timelines of the Hamas attack. They were not involved in the operational/tactical level. They provided assistance to Hamas. And second of all, Hezbollah was likely surprised, too, in ways that forced Hezbollah’s hands to react. So, I mean, that’s interesting for those who have wondered to what degree Iran was involved in the actual event of October 7th.
But I’m curious, your thoughts on what you took away from the northern border.
Ms. Rudman: Deep concern. It’s the visual knowledge of just how on the edge things are, people are. And the extent – I guess I would quickly scope out to the region because we haven’t talked about the Houthis and what the United States has been involved in, how it affects shipping; the number – even since mid-December, the number of companies who have said they are no longer shipping through the Red Sea, which also has an Iran factor to it. But I would also – the reasons – and I think it’s incredibly difficult for this administration to navigate this because they know it is –
Dr. Jones: This U.S. administration.
Ms. Rudman: The U.S. administration.
Dr. Jones: Yeah.
Ms. Rudman: They know it is in no one’s interest for the conflict to expand in Lebanon, for Iran to get any more involved than they already are. And though arguable, I think you can look at various signs of Nasrallah, of Hezbollah modulating – I’m not going to use the word “moderate” with him, but modulating – the response to keep it from fully escalating with Hezbollah. I think there are signs in Iran, too, that they recognize it’s not in their interest. That doesn’t mean it won’t still happen, and that’s also part of what I’m concerned about on the Israeli side, because all of this will end up being on the United States with some extraordinarily difficult decisions. We already supply a huge amount of what Israel needs now and what they will need if they – if things up on the border with Lebanon. We know the challenge and the importance of getting stuff to Ukraine. We need to keep reserves ourselves, as well. And we have – and we know that our industrial strategy is such that the mobilization within the United States to deliver what folks need for these kinds of things is going to take more time.
And so there is a lot of interest in maximizing us ending up on the side of the equation, Eliot, where this doesn’t happen. And I appreciate that’s – I think I appreciate your talking about what you think is likely. I’m looking at how we can get ahead of that, lead the United States government, which none of us are –
Dr. Jones: Yeah. By the way, on the – on the regional dimension, I mean, what has been interesting to watch since October is the strikes against U.S. bases in Syria. These are Syria militia. These are Conoco oilfields as well as the U.S. base in Al-Tanf. In Iraq, these are largely Hashd al-Sha’bi, the popular mobilize forces, also relationship with the Islamic Revolution Guard’s Quds Force. And then the Houthis, that you mentioned.
And even, frankly, after the initial U.S. strikes, we’ve now seen a response by the Houthis to target U.S. shipping and other shipping in the Red Sea. So, you know, the one broader issue – and I’m going to ask you both to provide some sort of final thoughts on where you would like to – you know, if you were advising the U.S. president right now, what you would like to see happen to – I mean, I think a full-blown regional war, whatever that looks like, would probably be in no one’s interest. So how do you – how do you manage this, Eliot? And then I’ll turn to Mara too.
Dr. Cohen: So, you know, I’ll begin by saying I’m not the greatest admirer of this administration, though I was a bigger critic of its predecessor. But I do give them a lot of credit for moving those two aircraft carriers off the coast of Lebanon at the very beginning of this, because the dangerous moment – you’re right, Hezbollah didn’t know about this. Iran didn’t know about the day. But they had been deeply involved in training Hamas. I mean, when we went to the weapons display, you know, you saw the IEDs. These were Iranian IEDs.
Dr. Jones: Explosively formed penetrators. These were –
Dr. Cohen: Right. These were the very sophisticated kinds of things that they used on us in Iraq. You look at where the weapons came from. So their fingerprints are all over this. If – there was a fraught moment I think where they may have been surprised, but they may also have been thinking, well, maybe this is the moment. Because let’s be very clear, I mean, the ultimate objective of Hamas and Hezbollah and Iran is to destroy Israel. I mean, that is the bottom line. And I think we have to understand that that is what they’re aiming for. And I do think the administration helped deter it.
Now, quick in terms of how you deal with it now, my view with the Houthis is those people do not manufacture radars. They do not manufacture missiles. They do not have targeting information. They get all this from the Iranians. And they are – and there are IRGC people – Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps – operatives on the ground training them. The IRGC is in Syria. They are absolutely in Lebanon. My view is, if you want to prevent the outbreak of a war, you make it very clear to the Iranians that if their proxies cause war like that, they are going to be the ones who pay. And so actually I’ve felt for some time that we’ve been all too hesitant in responding to the Houthis, and not just in terms of going after Houthis who are shooting off these missiles, but going after Iranians.
Dr. Jones: So there’s a term in one of Thoms Schelling’s books called “latent violence” that this sounds a little bit like. So, Mara, you get the last word.
Ms. Rudman: So I’m with Eliot on going after the Houthis. And we’re now on the third round of that. I think it’s probably a delicate balance in terms of the Iranians, because what we talked about before – the broader tinderbox and what we’re ready for or not. I think the single most important action right now is not with the administration. It’s with Congress to actually supply the funding that the administration has been asking for, for both Ukraine and Israel. Because ultimately that’s funding for the United States, for our national security interests, and, frankly, for our defense manufacturers to be able to produce what is needed for those two places. And so it is critical that that go forward to allow the administration to make the kind of careful and strategic decisions that support what is needed in Israel, and in Ukraine, and in the region.
Dr. Jones: Well, Mara, Eliot, thank you for joining us today, and thank you, those on the viewer side, for viewing this. Really appreciate you coming in to talk about your time on the ground in Israel. I mean, it is – you know, it is one thing to read about this, talk about it. It is a very different – it gives one a very different perspective to go on the ground and actually talk to people and see things.
Dr. Cohen: Well, and I want to thank the two of you and the others who have joined me. This was – we all had to pull it together somewhat at the last moment. It was stressful. It was – it wasn’t easy. And it was – but it was a collective effort. And I’m really grateful to you and other colleagues for being part of it.
Ms. Rudman: I appreciate the experience.
Dr. Jones: Well, thank you very much.
Ms. Rudman: Thank you.

76,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/why-did-united-states-just-bomb-yemen,Jon B. Alterman,"January 12, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"In the overnight hours of January 11–12, U.S. and British forces used air-, ship-, and submarine-launched weapons against about 60 targets in Yemen.
Q1: Why did U.S. and British forces attack Yemen?
A1: In response to more than 25 attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels in Yemen in the last two months, the U.S. and British militaries attacked around 60 Houthi targets with more than 100 precision-guided missiles. They had support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, and the Netherlands. The countries acted about 24 hours after the UN Security Council condemned the Houthi attacks. About 12 percent of all international trade passes through the Red Sea. While the Houthis said their attacks were in support of the Palestinians and only targeted shipping that involved Israel in some way, shipping costs shot up and many shipowners have been avoiding the Red Sea entirely.
Q2: Will this turn into another Middle Eastern war?
A2: Probably not. Neither side is looking to have an all-out war, and they are badly mismatched. But that is not to say that the Houthis will stop attacking shipping, or that the United States will stop attacking the Houthis.
Q3: What is the dynamic? What does “winning” look like for to either side?
A3: The Houthis derive prestige from being in a battle with the United States, as they present themselves as bravely standing up to U.S. and Israeli attacks on Palestinian civilians. Because their only option is asymmetrical warfare, they keep doing cheap things to get attention. They have few valuable assets that the United States can hold at risk, so the United States has a hard time designing target sets that will change Houthi calculations. For the United States, leading an international coalition that can restore security is the clear goal, but that leadership has proven hard. Saudi Arabia has reportedly cautioned against military strikes on the Houthis, and France and Italy have declined to join a U.S.-led naval force.
Q4: If Houthis are supposedly Iranian proxies, shouldn’t the United States be pushing back at Iran?
A4: The Iranians have been supporting the Houthis for more than a decade, probably at a pace of about $100 million per year. They give them some weapons, training, and technology, but the two sides have always found that keeping each other at arm’s length serves both their interests. The Iranians certainly have influence over the Houthis, but it is probably a mistake to think they are directing them in these attacks. That being said, the Iranian leadership must be delighted that forces attributed to them are gaining global attention, that the U.S. military is struggling to build an international force to fight the Houthi threat, and that an underdog is willing to stand up for Palestinians against Western hegemony. One of the Iranian government’s innovations in recent years has been to support regional forces that they do not actually control. Their efforts are attributable but deniable, and the Iranians feel they enjoy benefits without paying the costs.
Q5: What does the attack on the Houthis mean for Yemeni peace talks?
A5: The Houthi insurgency has been going on for more than two decades, but before Gaza erupted in October, it had seemed headed toward a better place. Yemenis aligned with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were in constructive talks with the Houthis, supported by U.S. and UN mediators. While the ceasefire between the Yemeni antagonists has largely held, the Houthi attacks on shipping have made the mediation more difficult. It is possible that this gets unstuck as part of a broader regional peace push as Gaza violence winds down. For the most part, the Houthis have concluded that time is on their side, and they are willing to go through short-term pain to advance their long-term goals.

77,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/siege-gazas-water,"Natasha Hall, Anita Kirschenbaum, and David Michel","January 12, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"On October 9, in response to the October 7 assault by Hamas militants, Israel’s defense minister ordered a “complete siege” on the Gaza Strip, including the halting of electricity, food, water, and fuel sent to Gaza from Israel. Clean water is unavailable for most living in Gaza, and Israeli airstrikes are destroying water infrastructure and wells—in potential violation of international humanitarian law—in addition to taking thousands of lives and displacing almost two million Gazans. Even more lives are at risk as the threat of disease increases. Improving water access in Gaza is essential to preventing further loss of life and livelihoods and to rebuilding a secure and sustainable future when the present conflict ceases.
A Water Crisis Worsened by War
Gazans struggled to access adequate safe water even before the current crisis. About 90 percent of Gaza’s water supply comes from the Coastal Aquifer Basin, which runs along the eastern Mediterranean coast from Egypt through Gaza and into Israel. However, the water is brackish and contaminated due to seawater intrusion, overextraction, and sewage and chemical infiltration. Consequently, Gazans rely on small-scale desalination units and unregulated private water tankers, which can be costly and pose additional health risks. The remaining 10 percent of water not pumped from the Coastal Aquifer comes primarily from three Israeli pipelines and from small-scale seawater desalination plants.
As a result of Israel’s siege, Gazans’ access to water from all sources, including desalination and external Israeli sources, quickly dropped by 95 percent after October 9. The United Nations estimates that the average Gazan is living on only 3 liters of water per day for all needs—well below the United Nation’s emergency standard of 15 liters. Without energy, all five of Gaza’s wastewater treatment plants and most of its 65 sewage pumping stations were forced to shut down by mid-November. Some small desalination plants in southern Gaza may be operating at a much reduced capacity, but plants in northern Gaza are not functional. As many as 70 percent of Gazans now resort to drinking salty and contaminated water straight from wells.
The ongoing violence after October 7 further exacerbates the crisis. The Applied Research Institute in Jerusalem estimated that of 581 key water and sanitation facilities, 37 were destroyed and 226 had suspected damage by November 14. Daily bombardments restrict civilians’ ability to collect water, render farming impossible, endanger staff operating water plants, and limit circulation of water tankers.
Airstrikes and Israeli evacuation orders have driven much of the population from their homes seeking safety. Some 1.9 million Gazans—nearly 93 percent of Gaza’s population—have been displaced since Israel’s invasion. The staggering number of internally displaced people (IDPs) increases water stress in Southern Gaza, with water systems in the south ill-equipped to meet the rising demand. Constantly moving populations complicate delivery of water supplies, and the crowding in southern Gaza has led to the spread of waterborne illness and disease stemming from lack of hygiene. By November 9, humanitarian organizations warned that outbreaks of cholera and typhoid were imminent. 
Israel’s control over Gaza’s borders has inhibited aid agencies’ ability to fill the gaps. When aid trucks were finally allowed to enter Gaza through the Rafah crossing on October 21, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) delivered over 44,000 bottles of drinking water as part of the 20-truck convoy—only one day’s supply of water for 22,000. The November 24 truce temporarily allowed for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees and UNICEF to supply fuel to Gaza’s main water utility, which in turn distributed it to water and sanitation facilities in the south, but aid agencies remained unable to improve access to water in the north.
The Resulting Public Health Disaster
A long-expected health crisis has now surged. Inadequate water quality and quantity can lead to decreased water consumption and associated unsafe hygiene practices related to contaminated food, hands, and utensils. By November 29, the World Health Organization reported more than 75,000 documented cases of diarrhea since mid-October with children under age five accounting for around half the cases. By comparison, in 2021 and 2022, Gaza averaged 2,000 diarrhea cases a month among young children. Without access to clean water, doctors are resorting to chemical disinfectants to sterilize instruments. Coupled with the unavailability of iodine to clean wounds, hospitals struggle to provide sufficient care. Medical experts also fear the collapse of water and wastewater treatment services, together with overcrowding in hospitals, makeshift camps, and shelters, could fuel the spread of infections resistant to antimicrobial treatment.
The breakdown of Gaza’s water systems risks prolonging a deepening social and public health disaster even after the conflict ends. Before October 7, 26 percent of diseases observed in Gaza were water-related, stemming from reliance on the contaminated and brackish Coastal Aquifer Basin in conjunction with inadequate and under-resourced water services. Now, damage to sanitation infrastructure is causing untreated wastewater and sewage to overflow into the streets and the sea. Over time, wastes can leach into the groundwater supplies, polluting wells and nearby agricultural areas. Common diseases caused by contaminated water include diarrhea, viral hepatitis, liver and kidney diseases, methemoglobinemia (blue baby syndrome), and anemia. The wars in Syria, Yemen, Ukraine, and Iraq For example, the conflict in Yemen that began in 2015 damaged or destroyed critical water infrastructure. In 2016 and 2017, two devastating cholera outbreaks flared after heavy rainfalls overwhelmed compromised sewage and stormwater systems, resulting in over two million recorded cases and 3,500 related deaths. In some cases, damage to water infrastructure in conflict zones can pose greater health risks than the violence itself. UNICEF reports that during protracted conflicts, children under five are over 20 times more likely to die from diarrheal diseases linked to unsafe water and sanitation than from violence.
These health concerns do not just endanger Gaza but can travel across borders through sewage and water systems. Without functioning treatment plants in Gaza, tens of millions of gallons of raw sewage are discharged daily into the Mediterranean Sea, renewing pollution threats to the intake of desalination plants in Israel. And while prior to the current siege Gaza’s health clinics were able to detect waterborne diseases, Gaza’s overwhelmed health practitioners have limited capacity for disease containment. Were an epidemic to arise, disruption and mass displacement could spread diseases to neighboring countries, as it did in 2015, when a cholera outbreak exacerbated by instability in Iraq widened to Syria, Kuwait, and Bahrain.
Gaza’s Collapsing Water Systems and Infrastructure
Even more destructive than previous conflicts in Gaza, the current violence impairs an already brittle water sector. Years of clashes between Hamas and Israel have severely deteriorated Gaza’s water and sanitation services. The 2014 war alone caused $34 million in damage to these systems. During the May 2021 escalation, 290 water infrastructure “objects” were damaged, inflicting $10–15 million in damages. At the same time, the denial of humanitarian access and the blockade on Gaza significantly slowed repairs and restoration of water services, leaving them vulnerable to further degradation. Following the 2021 conflict, untreated sewage flowed into the streets, lakes, and sea from damaged wastewater infrastructure. With the destruction still incompletely repaired months later, severe storms in 2022 led to flash flooding worsened by damaged pipes and stormwater drains clogged with untreated waste.
Israel, worried that piping could be used to make weapons, has restricted the equipment needed to enhance Gaza’s water services. These restrictions, combined with frequent bouts of conflict and repeated destruction of critical infrastructure, have made donors wary of investing in Gaza’s water sector. By 2016, around 79 percent of the desalination plants were unlicensed, and 38 percent of the water they produced was contaminated. Such challenges forced the authorities into a reactive cycle of rebuilding damaged water infrastructure and abandoning more forward-looking plans for resilient systems, such as artificial aquifer recharge. Instead, donors and aid agencies have invested in decentralized wastewater and desalination plants, solar panels, and other dispersed facilities to mitigate the consequences of the blockade and recurrent violence.
However, according to a recent study, many of these installations have been destroyed. Humanitarian aid organizations reported to CSIS that NICEF and EU-funded desalination plant in northern Gaza that provided 10,000 cubic meters of drinkable water per day, which makes up 14 percent of Gaza’s potable water, has been damaged, as well as the beach well where the plant extracted water. The Gaza Central Wastewater Plant was also severely damaged. Opened in April 2021 with an additional solar panel field providing electricity, the facility treated the sewage of over half of Gaza’s population. The solar field, meant to increase the resilience of a blockaded Gaza, has been destroyed.
While the violence continues, many uncertainties will remain as to the conflict’s scope and long-term impact. Yet the damage to Gaza’s infrastructure will eventually need to be assessed in hopes of reconstruction and water systems will need to be restored, raising several important considerations.
Barriers to Reconstruction
Many challenges have hindered past post-conflict reconstruction efforts, including inadequate financing, import restrictions, lengthy approval processes, and difficulties ensuring that Hamas will not benefit from the aid provided. This has rendered previous recovery efforts far too slow and limited Gaza’s ability both to establish more resilient water systems and prevent the impending collapse of the Coastal Aquifer. Reconstruction efforts after Israel’s May 2021 offensive only began four months after the ceasefire, with rebuilding estimated to cost up to $485 million over the first two years. In comparison, UNICEF now calculates immediate costs of $53.4 million to meet urgent water and sanitation needs. The ultimate price of reconstruction will be colossal. One analysis estimates the cost of rebuilding decimated housing stocks alone at $3.5 billion.
Past reconstruction has primarily focused on the immediate requirements of the region, not long-term solutions. Given the persistent threat of conflict in the region, it is imperative to support resilient water systems and infrastructure that can meet the needs of civilians in times of crisis. This requires much faster and greater levels of funding, agreements enabling imports of critical supplies for essential infrastructure, and an increased focus on improving the delivery of safe water services to conflict-affected and displaced communities.
Protecting Water in Times of Conflict
The near complete blockade on water in Gaza is unprecedented. During times of conflict, international humanitarian law prohibits attacking or destroying “objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population,” such as water infrastructure and drinking water installations. International law also forbids depriving civilians of access to water and requires parties to conflict to allow safe passage for humanitarian relief. In Gaza, water infrastructure has been destroyed and the delivery of clean water and fuel to operate water treatment plants has also been impeded. The protection of water under international humanitarian law needs to be strengthened and upheld, and greater allowances made for the importation of critical supplies, in addition to the prioritization of long-term and resilient solutions.
Yet no solution can be achieved by Gaza or Israel in isolation. All the region’s water and wastewater sources cross into Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza alike. Both populations have an interest in tackling the crisis before it further undermines environmental and public health.
Some have argued that the United States and the international community should support development of a multiyear cooperative agreement for the importation of bulk water into Gaza from Israel. In the wake of so much violence, it will be difficult to achieve the trust needed for such collaboration. Assistance constructing much-needed water infrastructure in Gaza is another necessary step, but Israel’s political calculations on the future of Gaza may overwhelm such efforts.
This latter issue points to a more fundamental need. International and regional actors will have a larger role to play than financing in the aftermath of hostilities. Donor states and influential stakeholders will need to help mobilize substantial resources and apply pressure to the parties to this conflict to move toward a more sustainable, equitable, and secure future. While many issues remain uncertain and contentious, ensuring Gazans clean water availability in the near term could avoid full-blown environmental and health catastrophes. Plans to deliver aid and water by ships, for instance, which can transport 500 times more supplies than trucks, should be considered. Over the longer term, using a mixture of aid and careful diplomacy, countries with Israel’s trust, such as the United States, can start to push this process while providing security guarantees during this conflict.

78,title,https://www.csis.org/analysis/gazas-human-crisis-demands-rethink,Leonard Rubenstein and J. Stephen Morrison,"January 12, 2024",CSIS,Washington D.C.,analysis,"A Cataclysm Is Born
Hamas’s October 7, 2023, massacre of 1,200 Israelis, sexual violence, and seizure of around 240 hostages shocked Israel politically and psychologically. At the same time, Hamas cynically plunged its own Palestinian population into infinite peril. Soon, over a quarter of a million Israelis were displaced from around Gaza and the Lebanon border. Israel’s ferocious response to the Hamas attacks, now entering its fourth month, turned into a sustained aerial and ground campaign, accompanied by a brutal siege that continues to severely limit fuel, electricity, water, food, and medicine to Gazans.
Both sides see the war in existential terms and demonstrate little regard for civilian lives. Israel, thus far only modestly successful in its fight to destroy Hamas’ vast underground structures, has laid waste to much of what is aboveground. The war—including its vast human toll—has in turn spurred a volatile geopolitical crisis that, as recent events in Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, and the Bab al-Mandab Strait have suggested, may spark a wider regional conflagration.
Israel’s assaults have damaged or destroyed 70 percent of Gaza’s housing and nearly half of its infrastructure, and according to the Gaza Ministry of Health, killed more than 23,000 people—more than two-thirds of them women and children—and injured another 59,000. That accounts for more than 3.5 percent of Gaza’s 2.3 million citizens. Almost two million people have been displaced to areas that remain acutely unsafe. They remain unprotected from the elements and face severe shortages of potable water, fuel, and food. The result is a human catastrophe that threatens to generate deaths and impairment that exceed the extreme harm caused by bombardment. In the meantime, Israeli leadership has denied responsibility while Hamas leadership remains underground and out of sight, or overseas, unaccountable for what it has provoked through its atrocities. Thus far, international pressure has largely failed to change the conduct of the war. A much tougher, more aggressive U.S. leadership is now urgently needed to press for changes by Israel and Hamas and mobilize others around a common strategy, if Gaza’s population is to stabilize, see some early signs of hope of recovery, and escape the apocalyptic situation they now inhabit.
Healthcare Erased
On January 3, the United Nations reported more than 400,000 cases of infectious disease since October 7, including 180,000 cases of upper respiratory infections, along with increases in meningitis, skin rashes, scabies, lice, and chicken pox. As of December 21, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported more than 100,000 cases of diarrhea, half among children under five, a 25-fold increase since the war began. More than 90 percent of families are experiencing crisis levels of hunger and malnutrition that significantly lower resistance to further disease. The World Food Program’s chief economist claims that more than 80 percent of the people in the world suffering famine and catastrophic levels of hunger reside in Gaza.
Gaza’s entire health system has been decimated, with only a third of hospitals even partially functioning. As of December 29, the WHO reported 294 attacks on healthcare—including hospitals, clinics, ambulances, health workers, and patients since October 7—that have killed 600 people, including patients within hospitals. Not since the incendiary and high explosive bombing seen in the Korean War 70 years ago has such a high percentage of hospitals in a war zone been so severely damaged or destroyed. 
Those hospitals still open remain severely overcrowded, without the means to provide baseline support to patients. Dr. Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO emergency director for the Gaza, said that in many hospitals, parents of very sick children are now instructed to remove them from hospitals and care for them by whatever means at home. Specialty services such as cancer centers, including those for children, have been shuttered. There are no care options to address Gaza’s severe mental health needs, given the closure of the only psychiatric hospital and all six community mental health centers, as well as the collapse of teletherapy due to blackouts in internet and telecommunications.
No One to the Rescue
UN agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and a small number of international NGOs, most notably Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)/Doctors without Borders, struggle to transcend operational barriers and worsening insecurity. Supply blockades, road and infrastructure damage, and attacks on health care facilities and professionals have utterly stymied health and humanitarian workers in carrying out their mission. They are able to provide at best a minor fraction of what they are capable of delivering and what is urgently needed—at great risk. UNRWA, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East, the main provider of health and education in Gaza, has lost over 146 staff members as of January 10, the highest loss of staff ever by a UN agency in a conflict. 
Quite conspicuous and disturbing is the indifference of Israeli forces to the severely wounded and sick patients they encounter in hospital assaults. International humanitarian law obligates combatants to respect and protect patients, including ensuring care for them, as well as to minimize harm to civilians in military operations. These duties apply even if a hospital is used by Hamas for tunnel access or other military purposes. 
Israeli forces have taken almost no steps to minimize harm to patients during hospital sieges and assaults, by, for example, providing essential medical supplies, medication, sufficient fuel for sustained electricity, and food. A month after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) assaulted al-Shifa Hospital, a joint UN mission led by the WHO found that the hospital, while still trying to care for desperately wounded and ill patients, lacked fuel, oxygen, blood for transfusion, staff, food, safe water, and supplies. The team saw patients with traumatic injuries being sutured on the floor, with little to no pain medication.
The IDF has exacerbated the harm by detaining, interrogating, and abusing members of medical staffs. As of December 14, it had detained at least 41 health workers (and another 45 in the West Bank). Palestinian Red Crescent Society medics were even detained while participating in WHO supply and evacuation convoys. Some, detained in mid-November, were still held a month later. A medic who was released told WHO colleagues that he had been beaten, stripped, blindfolded, subjected to degrading and humiliating abuse, and “left to walk towards the south with his hands still tied behind his back, and without clothes or shoes.” 
In many cases, the IDF impeded safe evacuation of seriously ill or wounded patients, even as it demanded that they leave hospitals. Israeli troops shot at WHO convoys seeking to resupply hospitals. Two people were killed, likely by the IDF, in clearly marked MSF cars, and on multiple occasions MSF ambulances were destroyed.
The UN Security Council has been largely impotent in addressing the Gaza crisis, in large part because the United States has used its veto power to block otherwise broadly supported resolutions that would have pressed for a ceasefire. (The December 22 Security Council resolution on Gaza, which the United States abstained from voting on, contained no reference to a ceasefire.) The Biden administration has repeatedly called on Israel to protect civilians in the conduct of the war, including a direct call by President Biden to end indiscriminate bombing of civilians. Nonetheless, Israel has refused to change its battlefield tactics significantly even as Israel fails to achieve its strategic goal not just of defeating Hamas but eliminating it, while winning release of the remaining hostages. The Biden administration’s only major success to date, supported by U.S. allies, has been to successfully press for a one-week pause in late November that led to modest temporary increases in humanitarian aid and the release of 100 hostages. 
When the pause ended on December 1, Israel renewed its massive assaults, including in the south, where it instructed Gazans to flee. The Netanyahu government has also rejected proposals for a reformed Palestinian Authority to play a significant role in the governance of Gaza, while doing little if anything to curb settler violence in the West Bank and moving forward with annexation there. Far-right ministers continue to call for expelling Palestinians from Gaza. Although Israel opened a new access point for humanitarian aid at Kerem Shalom, the gains thus far in humanitarian flows have been inconsequential. International organizations have faced continuing challenges delivering aid, particularly in the north, where the United Nations says only a quarter of planned aid missions were successful from January 1 to 11, compared to a 70 percent success rate in December.
 The Gazan Trap
The stark reality is that in 2024 Gazans are likely to be forced to live for an indefinite period trapped in conditions of unspeakable suffering, without anything approaching minimal housing, nutrition, health services, mental health support, water, a functioning economy of any description, and hope. A higher and higher percentage of Gaza’s population is likely to experience premature death, extreme injury, and life-threatening illness. Gaza is steadily becoming the site of thousands of tents occupied by a sick, grieving, and burgeoning population, where the death toll from preventable and treatable disease increasingly competes with that from bombardment. 
At present, there is no visible pathway out for Gazans to avoid becoming ruined for a generation or more. This scenario is entirely plausible, given the continuation of the Israeli war effort, compounded by no apparent change in Hamas’s calculations, continued confusion and uncertainty over what governing arrangements might eventually be possible in postwar Gaza, the ever-present threat of regional escalation, and the continued inability of UN agencies and other international groups to operate inside Gaza.
What to Do Right Now?
The United States is the only country that can exercise significant leverage over Israeli conduct in the war, but thus far it has not used that influence effectively, while respecting Israel’s legitimate security interests. In the meantime, the United States has stimulated intense anger and resentment among its allies, while its reputation has been seriously damaged, as credible organizations now accuse the administration of complicity in war crimes. A case alleging Israeli genocide against Palestinians is pending in the International Court of Justice.
It makes no sense for the Biden administration to continue hoping that persuasion alone will be sufficient to restrain Israel’s military tactics and increase aid access and delivery. That approach has failed with few exceptions. Israel has announced plans to reduce the number of IDF troops in Gaza next month, but intense assaults continue in the meantime. Likewise, it makes no sense to simply look beyond the burgeoning catastrophe and focus entirely on “the day after” the war ends.
As 2024 opens, the Biden administration urgently needs to reset its strategy, focused on what needs to be accomplished now, to avoid the unthinkable outcomes that look entirely possible.
Beginning right away in the first quarter of 2024, the Biden administration should make clear that it is now a high U.S. policy priority to stabilize and protect the Gazan population and begin a process of recovery. That should include a statement that there will be no further U.S. military assistance until there is concrete proof that Israel is no longer imposing significant harm upon civilians in military operations, fully restores electricity and water, and actively expedites a major expansion of critical assistance, including crash efforts to stem the food crisis. To achieve these ends, the United States should also indicate that it is also prepared to forego the use of a veto in the UN Security Council to block a ceasefire resolution. The following steps, which do not impede Israel’s security, should be implemented rapidly:
Require concrete proof that the IDF is beginning to comply with international humanitarian law on protecting civilians and health care and implementing well-recognized “deconfliction” mechanisms to facilitate safe medical and humanitarian passage and access to care.
Quadruple the flow of food, fuel, medicines, and construction materials, while restoring electricity and water and speeding up inspections of goods and vehicles. In this period, the United States should refine what are accurate, truly sufficient targets for humanitarian aid flows over the long-term and establish mechanisms for tracking whether they are met.
Lead the establishment of an ad hoc coalition of Palestinians, UN agencies, international NGOs, and committed states to support an accelerated stabilization of Gaza and first phase of recovery. The WHO, UNRWA, the World Food Program, and UNICEF will play essential roles in restoring basic health and nutrition.
Expand U.S. technical support through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S. Agency for International Development to WHO and other UN agencies to strengthen Palestine laboratory capabilities, infectious disease data surveillance and monitoring, supply chains, and delivery of health services.
Engage Arab countries to press Hamas for a cessation of fighting, respect of the integrity and autonomy of humanitarian aid planning and distribution, an end to the use of civilians as shields, and the expedited release of hostages.

Courage to Face Reality
There has recently been much intense discussion on how to end the violence, establish effective governance free of Hamas in the near and longer term, and move toward a two-state solution, which is increasingly recognized as the only plausible way to end the larger Israeli-Palestinian conflict (even as the Netanyahu government rules out that option). That debate should and will no doubt continue. But in the meantime, the cataclysm for Palestinians in Gaza is no longer on the horizon. It is here and now, in front of all to see. The United States needs to recognize the global threat of Gaza becoming a permanent wasteland of suffering, become far tougher and more assertive toward Israel and Hamas, and initiate the urgent steps needed to stabilize the Gazan population and restore some early hope that an eventual recovery is within reach. A wasteland outcome will damage U.S. national interests and, arguably, Israeli interests as well, if it results in unfathomable suffering that defies any ethical explanation, sparks higher regional instability, and creates a long-term barrier to a political resolution. The proposed U.S. strategy is certainly not guaranteed of success and carries risks, yet the alternative—the current status quo—is far worse. In essence, the approach is a call for boldness, courage, humility, sustained commitment, and intensified engagement.
