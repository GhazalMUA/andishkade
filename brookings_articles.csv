2,USAID can’t go it alone on localization,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/usaid-cant-go-it-alone-on-localization/,Patrick Fine,"February 5, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Localization, the current shorthand for how to make development work more locally led, is one of the most enduring policy objectives for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).  Espoused by both Republican and Democratic administrations, it traces back at least to the Clinton administration’s endorsement of the principle of country ownership in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000 and continued with the Bush administration’s signing the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. While terms have changed over the years—USAID has called for “local solution,” a “journey to self-reliance,” and now, “locally led development”—the objective has remained the same: to channel more foreign assistance directly to homegrown institutions in developing countries.
It is striking just how resilient—and illusive—this policy objective is. At a time when there is little consensus about anything, localization continues to enjoy bipartisan support. Some on the left see it as essential to sustainable development and a way to decolonize aid, while some on the right see it as a step toward dismantling the foreign aid industry, increasing cost-effectiveness, and reducing aid handouts. So, if everyone agrees localization is the way to go, why, in the words of USAID’s Administrator Samantha Power, is it so hard to meet even modest localization targets?
It is not for lack of trying. Just in the last three years, USAID has articulated a localization vision, updated its risk appetite statement, issued new guidance on local capacity strengthening, clarified who counts as local, revised procurement procedures to make it easier to fund local organizations, started tracking a set of 14 good practices that elevate local leadership, and implored its staff to go local. Yet, despite these efforts, between 2021 and 2022 local awards increased only from 7.4% of “eligible funding” to 10.2%. Using a different methodology, the independent organization Publish What You Fund puts funding to local organizations at 5.7%. Whichever methodology is used, USAID will be far from achieving its 25% target when the clock runs out on this administration at the end of the year.
What should be clear by now is that USAID simply is not built to work with local organizations. In trying to do so it faces three issues it has yet to resolve. First, USAID has mostly focused on internal challenges of how to fund local organizations when the major obstacle is external pressure around what USAID funds. Second, the way Congress structures USAID’s appropriations leads it to rely on U.S. intermediaries to provide accountability for taxpayer dollars and results. And third is the comfort of working with longtime partner organizations.
Since USAID is a bilateral agency, its principal counterpart—and the legitimate representative of its partner countries—is the national government (except in special cases, such as Myanmar and Afghanistan, where the United States government does not recognize the legitimacy of the government in power and USAID works only with nonstate actors). And for the most part, partner governments want to address big national needs like building infrastructure, strengthening health and education systems, supporting business development, and fostering a policy environment to sustain and grow a modern economy. Large-scale programs to strengthen systems require organizations, or in USAID-speak, implementing partners (IPs), with sophisticated business systems, specialized expertise, access to working capital, and the know-how to deliver on-time results (regardless of whether the funding instrument is a grant, cooperative agreement, or contract). Part of what makes localization so hard is that few local organizations are equipped to do what partner governments want and what USAID is built and funded to deliver. Moreover, while local organizations are hungry for USAID funding, most do not aspire to be de facto U.S. government contractors. For them, localization means foreign aid grants to pursue their mission, not USAID’s.
Until USAID reconciles what it finances—which generally seeks to align with partner countries’ national development plans and congressional and administration directives—with what local organizations do, changing how it gives out money will not produce the results localization advocates are looking for.
The second problem is the structure of USAID’s operating model. Over 50 years a symbiotic relationship has evolved between USAID and its mostly U.S. implementing partners. This “aid-industrial complex” took root during the Cold War when USAID justified its budget both by the need to project American soft power in the developing world and by claiming that most foreign assistance dollars stayed in the U.S., creating jobs and strengthening American businesses (an old take on the “doing well by doing good” argument). Although this justification fell out of favor in the 2000s as the development community embraced localization, judging by the growth of the aid industry, USAID’s dependence on U.S. implementing partners has only deepened in the 21st century.
USAID outsources program implementation because of the way Congress divides its appropriations between a small pot for operating expenses to run the agency and a much larger allocation to finance programs. Add in congressional and administrative directives and compliance requirements—to guard against misconduct, support a plethora of priorities, and measure and report on results that respond to domestic advocacy groups—and you have an operating model that has come to rely on purpose-built IPs who understand and can manage the complex and risky business of working with the U.S. government.
A feature of the symbiotic relationship between USAID and its U.S. IPs is the way portfolio risk management is outsourced. USAID works in inherently high-risk environments where managing risk is both difficult and costly. By including the costs of risk management in its implementing partners’ negotiated indirect cost rates (NICRAs), USAID is able to use program funds to purchase a kind of “first loss risk insurance” that makes its IPS the first line of defense. This reduces USAID’s exposure to financial losses and provides some insulation from reputational and other types of risk. But this arrangement only works with established IPs who are able to devote substantial expertise and resources to an arduous yearslong process of negotiating and maintaining a NICRA. Over decades, this has enabled USAID’s established IPs to build strong risk management systems customized to USAID’s needs (and paid for by USAID) that provide the agency with significant protection. In contrast, few local organizations qualify for a NICRA and the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) allows awardees who do not have a NICRA to charge only 10% in indirect costs—far below what would be required to build and operate effective risk management systems.
This means as a mission’s portfolio becomes more local, it has less “risk insurance,” leaving it more exposed to adverse incidents—not due to local partners being inherently riskier than international organizations, but because they are less equipped and resourced to mitigate adverse incidents when they arise. Losing the “risk insurance” international IPs provide places far more operational demands for monitoring compliance, identifying misconduct, and enforcing corrective actions directly on USAID staff who often do not have the expertise or the bandwidth to take on work that was previously outsourced."

6,From ‘cat ladies’ to ‘brat’—How cultural currency builds political movements,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/from-cat-ladies-to-brat-how-cultural-currency-builds-political-movements/,Linda Peek Schacht,"July 30, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"For many years now Apple, Nike, Coca-Cola and many other top American companies have been building iconic brands into cultural icons by giving consumers experiences that create cultural capital. To do this, they use the unique music, video, and language of each generation. Nike created the Air Jordan culture; the announcement of a new Apple product is a much-anticipated international experience; and on a hilltop in Italy, Coca-Cola brought together young people from around the globe to “teach the world to sing.” In the past two weeks, America’s two major political parties gave master classes in this convergence of culture and experience. We witnessed the maturing of one movement and the birth of another. Both movements center on a cultural icon, creating a new cultural currency for their brand and telling very different stories of the American Dream. Donald Trump has had nine years to build the MAGA movement. Kamala Harris and the Democrats jumpstarted one in nine days following President Biden’s passing of the torch.
The MAGA brand
Donald Trump rallies have always been day-long marketing experiences around him as a cultural icon. The emotional capital of a failed assassination attempt created new cultural currency for the brand. The “millimeter miracle” was portrayed as divine intervention. It appeared in visuals of Jesus stopping the bullet and of Trump’s bloodied head and raised fist on t-shirts and mugs just hours after the shooting. His defiant shout, “fight!” became a new rally chant and bandaged ears reflecting Trump’s wound became a new look in the MAGA experience. A branded Trump assassination attempt trading card carried the call to arms: “First they tried to jail him. Now they tried to kill him. Stand strong.” Celebrity strong men like Hulk Hogan proclaimed Trumpamania for the wrestling world. The phrase “he literally took a bullet for America” is included in Trump introductions. James Brown’s “It’s a Man’s World” now alternates with Lee Greenwood’s “I’m Proud to be An American” as Trump’s walk-on song.
MAGA’s patriotism brand is built on the flag, nationalism, and nostalgia. It found a new face and words in J.D. Vance, who urges crowds to celebrate “what America once was, and with God’s grace, what it will soon be again.” His walk-on song is Merle Haggard’s anti-Iraq war song “Let’s Rebuild America First.” The story of his working-class family entered popular culture through the movie of his memoir “Hillbilly Elegy”; it moved into the top 10 most watched movies on Netflix the week after the convention. Chants for his late gun-loving grandmother “MaMaw” and cheers for his mother’s 10-year sobriety are now part of the MAGA rally experience. That’s powerful, brand-building cultural currency for many Americans whose families have endured the pain of addiction.
The campaign and convention may have been designed for Joe Biden as the opponent, but Kamala Harris as the embodiment of America’s changing culture fits the movement’s idea of the enemy just as well, if not better, than Joe Biden did. Republicans began trying ways to burnish their own brand while undermining the Democrats’ efforts to create their own cultural icon. Efforts that ring true and tap Americans’ concerns like “border czar” may be more effective than “DEI hire” if the first week of the battle of the brands is any indication.
Biden passes the torch to Kamala and ignites a movement
With 100 days to go, the compressed timeframe accelerated Democratic efforts to unite the party and jumpstart a movement. Having already made history as the first woman and the first Black and South Asian person to be vice president, Kamala Harris literally embodies a changing America. She represents not only a growing multicultural America but also the trend toward women in leadership, the trend toward higher education attainments for women, and the trend toward blended families and interfaith and interracial marriages. 
In the first week, we saw examples of how that representation yields powerful cultural capital for her brand. The generational change at the top of the ticket unleashed music, language, and images to appeal not only to young people but also other generations eager to rejoin the fight. The chant “We’re not going back” and Beyonce’s “Freedom” as the campaign anthem counter the Republican’s nostalgia brand. The Obama “Yes We Can” poster has been recast as “Yes We Kam.” It’s the title of a video from the bipartisan women’s organization Seneca Project featuring influential women like Melinda French Gates.
Democrats are tapping the powerful cultural capital of movements born from America’s collective experiences including the George Floyd murder, January 6 insurrection, and Supreme Court Dobbs decision. These movements are rich in history and symbolism, now updated for the Kamala 2024 movement, best seen in the first video of the campaign.
Kamala as Rosie the Riveter embodied the candidate’s challenge: “Let’s Get to Work.” The prevailing symbol of the first week of work was Zoom. Two-hundred thousand people on a series of Zoom calls rallied Black, Latina, and white women and Black men, raising $200 million. According to participants, these calls didn’t just raise money; they were about strategy and how to get the job done.
Many of the women on these Zoom calls represented the trend Pew found on women in leadership and higher educational attainment. The latest attacks on their candidate for having a “low IQ”, being a “failure,” or a “DEI hire” may be great cultural currency for MAGA, but it infuriates these women. An army of social media warriors produced a backlash to J.D. Vance’s “childless cat lady” comment invoking Kamala’s name. Swifties flooded social media with Taylor Swift’s Time magazine cover with her cat and the tagline “Cat ladies stand back and stand by,” mimicking when Donald Trump in his 2020 debate with Joe Biden called on the Proud Boys, whose leaders would later be convicted for January 6, “to stand back and stand by.” The 2020 TikTok of Kristin Chenoweth’s Kamala take on her Wicked song “Popular” found a new audience. So did Keb’ Mo’s “Put a Woman in Charge” and the refrain “We demand to be heard; we demand to be seen,” from the Broadway musical “Suffs” about the fight for women’s suffrage.
The Democrats have a fight story just as the Republicans do, and Trump is at the center of both. The “prosecutor vs. the perpetrator” claims to “know Donald Trump’s type.” She says it with a smile, and for now, she seems more “happy warrior” than the “angry Black woman” portrayed by MAGA.  
She exudes optimism and seems to be genuinely having fun, at her own expense, owning her signature belly laugh and embracing video collages with her story about a coconut tree. The latter may have older politicians scratching their heads even as they use coconut tree emojis to endorse her online.
The rest of that coconut tree story shows up on TikTok with a lime-green filter and the word “brat”—the cover art and name of Charli XCX’s new album. Suddenly a generation of young voters think Kamala is “brat.” And for those wondering what that is, you are not the target audience.
That’s the beauty of movements built on cultural currency—there’s something for everyone, from J.D. Vance’s gun-loving grandma to Swiftie cat ladies to a pop star’s blessing of “brat.”
The Democrats had an impressive first week of stories and symbols marketing a new cultural icon Kamala Harris. The challenge is to leverage that cultural currency into a four-day brand-building extravaganza that matches what the Republicans did in Milwaukee.  "
7,Instrument of order,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/instrument-of-order/,Bruce Jones,"June 3, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"The topic of the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council—its performance, and its membership—is once again on the international agenda. High visibility debates, vetoes, and failures over Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Gaza crisis have drawn international attention back to the body, and to the U.N. Charter itself. The early days of the Ukraine war were met with a torrent of commentary about how the U.N. had failed at its founding purpose—preventing wars of aggression—and calls for Russia to be removed from its permanent seat. With accidental but fortuitous timing, India used its much-anticipated 2022 presidency of the G20 mechanism to place renewed focus on the case for Security Council reform (among other global governance topics), and Brazil is following up under its term, in both cases with a focus on adding new permanent members (notably including themselves.) Council reform is the most symbolically powerful part of a wider, growing chorus of demands from the more influential countries of the Global South for real reform to the core institutions of global order.  
Partially in response to Global South concerns, U.S. President Joe Biden also chose to make the case for Security Council reform during not just his 2022 but also his 2023 annual address to the U.N. General Assembly, and to follow that up with sustained U.S. diplomacy with members of the G4 (a coalition of aspiring permanent members: Brazil, India, Germany, and Japan) and other aspirants from Africa and Latin America, and various other reform groupings, to explore pathways to implementation. The hope is that permanent seats on the Security Council would give countries like India and Brazil and South Africa a stake in continuation of the established order, against what is seen by the United States as a sustained attack on that order by Russia and China.  
This hope—and it is only a hope, or at best an assessment—seems faint, especially when viewed against recent foreign policy decisions and positions of these three aspirant states. More credible is to recall and revive an older purpose and function of the council: as a body wherein opposing great powers could meet and chart pathways to de-escalation. Reviving this function of the council, as a tool for de-escalation, is more important than membership reform."
8,The danger of calling the Houthis an Iranian proxy,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-danger-of-calling-the-houthis-an-iranian-proxy/,Allison Minor,"September 3, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Since the Houthis began attacking international shipping, media coverage and official statements have defined them as an Iranian proxy, but this downplays the Houthis’ threat and obscures the solution to it. In truth, the Houthis are not an Iranian proxy, even though they benefit from Iranian support. Rigorous definitions of the term “proxy” require that the sponsor has some means of controlling the proxy, as this is what differentiates a proxy from a partner/ally. But Iran lacks control over Houthi behavior and the Houthis are not acting primarily on behalf of Iran. This is important because the Houthis have demonstrated that they are often a more unpredictable and aggressive actor than their Iranian supporters.
Rather than being part of a centralized proxy system, the Houthis are an independent part of an increasingly complex network that allows them to work directly with over a dozen other groups to share expertise, coordinate activities, and even collaborate on joint attacks. This web enables a proliferation of chaos far beyond what Iran could orchestrate by itself, and beyond what it can effectively control. For this reason, attempts to address the Houthis’ threat by putting pressure on or engaging with Iran are doomed to fail.
The Houthis are an independent actor
After a Houthi drone killed an Israeli citizen and wounded several others in Tel Aviv on July 19, the Houthis quickly announced that Iran only learned of the attack after the fact in an attempt to assert their own independence. The Houthis have consistently demonstrated that they retain sole authority over decisionmaking. At times, this has included taking actions that run counter to Iranian interests, as they did by declaring a unilateral cease-fire with Saudi Arabia in 2019, even as Iran sought to use the Houthis to escalate tensions in the region.
The Houthis have also tried to mitigate their dependence on Iranian weapons flows, securing critical weapons parts from China, developing independent financing schemes for weapons procurement, and now pursuing military support from Russia. While still dependent on external parts, the Houthis have improved their ability to manufacture weapons inside of Yemen and have honed their independent expertise with new weapons, leveraging the fact that they are battle-tested in a way Iran is not. Over the past several months alone, they have rapidly improved their use of unmanned surface vessels, allowing them to sink a Greek coal ship in June.
The Houthis’ independence from Iran is important because the Houthis are currently more likely than Iran to escalate. The Houthis are less vulnerable than Iran to U.S. and international pressure, meaning they can afford to take greater risks. After several years of a Saudi-led coalition air campaign, the Houthis have grown accustomed to shielding their weapons supply from airstrikes, which is why recent U.S. and U.K. strikes have failed to significantly erode the Houthis’ attack capabilities.
The Houthis are also less vulnerable to international sanctions, as they operate largely outside of the international financial system. Iran has been forced to cope with domestic unrest and the economic impact of financial sanctions. Yemenis, on the other hand, have been facing one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises for a decade, making them unfortunately more accustomed to the economic deprivation and violence that the Houthi approach has perpetuated in the country.
In Yemen, conflict has become the norm in a way that is not the case in Iran, and the Houthis have presented themselves as the sole defenders of Yemen against external aggression—a narrative that depends on continued conflict. For years, that “aggression” came from the Saudi-led coalition, but this year, the narrative expanded to include the United States. And after January 20, Israel, arguably the most compelling foe for the Houthis and their supporters, joined the fray. In this way, Israel’s retaliatory strikes on Yemen in July will serve to greatly embolden the Houthis and incentivize them to pursue continued and even greater conflict with Israel, potentially even after a Gaza cease-fire is in place. While the Houthis have framed their maritime and regional attacks in the context of the Gaza war, Yemen analysts widely agree that the Houthi’s attacks are largely driven by their own domestic imperatives and regional ambitions, such that the threat will likely persist even after a Gaza cease-fire is in place.
The Houthis as a new model of Iranian support
The tendency to consider all Iranian-backed groups as proxies may be due to the fact that Lebanese Hezbollah, the most powerful Iranian-backed group in the region, is in fact a proxy that has served as a model for Iran’s support to other groups. But this is an oversimplification: The level and nature of Iran’s support to groups like the Houthis and Hamas never came close to what it provided Hezbollah (the U.S. government assesses Iran still provides $700 million annually to Hezbollah), and they never shared Iran and Hezbollah’s level of ideological alignment. Replicating the decades-long, major investment Iran made in Hezbollah would be impractical at scale.
Iranian support for the Houthis instead represents a different model: limited initial investments in a group that shares some ideological alignment but comes from a distinct religious background (the Houthis ascribe to the Zaydi branch of Shia Islam, which varies significantly from the Twelver branch dominant in Iran). That investment then expands over time as the group demonstrates its strength, while Iran cedes control over the group’s decisionmaking but seeks to strengthen their ideological alignment. Because this model requires much fewer resources and works with groups that do not adhere to Iran’s Twelver Shia branch of Islam, Iran can effectively deploy this model across the Middle East and beyond.
The Houthis’ role in a larger network
When analysts and officials center Iran in the Houthi’s attacks, they misconstrue the nature of the network that has developed between the Houthis and other Iranian-backed groups. Because the Houthis work directly with many of the groups in this network, it creates a greater, more diffuse threat that may or may not involve Iran.
In June, the Houthis claimed a joint attack with the Islamic Resistance of Iraq on Israel’s Haifa port. Such coordinated attacks from multiple directions could become more regular and complicate defensive efforts. The Houthis’ cooperation could extend beyond the Middle East as well. U.S. officials recently reported that the Houthis are providing weapons to Somali militant group al-Shabab; coordinated attacks between the Houthis and al-Shabab against ships in the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea could further raise the costs of maritime shipping and frustrate U.S. attempts to combat the attacks. While only a fraction of Houthi attacks have resulted in serious damage to ships, they have stopped major shippers from sailing through the Red Sea, forcing a diversion to longer and costlier routes with cascading consequences for the industry. According to the Drewery World Container Index, container shipping costs have increased almost four-fold since the Houthi attacks began.1
This interconnected network also yields a faster proliferation of weapons and expertise. The Houthis have used years of war to hone their expertise and experiment with modifications to Iranian weapons—allowing them to successfully send drones over 1,600 miles and sink ships using unmanned boats. The Houthis’ direct engagement with groups like Hezbollah, who has similarly battled with its more powerful neighbors, was important to their development, and now the Houthis may share their expertise with other groups in the Middle East and Africa, exponentially increasing the regional threat.
Iran is not the solution to the Houthi threat
For too long, countries have sought to solve the Houthi threat via pressure on or engagement with Iran. This approach assumes that Iran either controls the Houthis, or that it has sufficient leverage to convince them to fundamentally change their behavior. Even if Iran were willing to cut off its support to the Houthis—which appears unlikely—the Houthis’ attempts to minimize their dependence on Iran and the diffuse nature of the network of Iranian-supported groups means the Houthis would endure.
Saudi Arabia’s détente agreement with Iran in March 2023 is perhaps the clearest example of why this approach is flawed. Many analysts hoped the agreement could help resolve the conflict in Yemen and promote regional stability. But that did not occur. By the time China helped broker that agreement, Yemen was a year into a U.N.-mediated truce that continues to prevent major Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia. It was not the agreement with Iran that allowed Saudi Arabia to de-escalate with the Houthis, it was the Yemen agreement that created the space for the Saudis to de-escalate with Iran. The Saudis realized that the solution to their Houthi problem did not run through Tehran but Sanaa. Israel and others who have focused on the Houthis as part of an Iranian threat, and countries like China that seek to appeal to Tehran to change Houthi behavior in the Red Sea, have not yet learned this lesson.
There is no easy solution to the Houthi threat. Addressing this threat requires either eliminating the Houthi’s capability to conduct disruptive attacks—which both a major Saudi-led coalition and more limited U.S. and U.K. strikes have failed to do—or changing the Houthis’ intent. A U.N.-led peace process in Yemen has sought to achieve the latter by shifting the Houthis’ incentives. However, the war in Gaza and a profound power imbalance between the Houthis and other Yemeni parties have complicated these efforts. Still, the April 2022 truce is evidence that the Houthis’ incentives can be shifted away from continued war. The challenge will be striking a careful balance that does not simply appease the Houthis and embolden them to launch a new round of violence."
9,"Echoes of 2006: Israel, Hezbollah, and the potential for regional war",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/echoes-of-2006-israel-hezbollah-and-the-potential-for-regional-war/,Jeffrey Feltman,"August 9, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"A momentous guessing game of three questions has entered its second week. When and how will Hezbollah and Iran retaliate for the assassinations of Hezbollah military leader Fuad Shukr in Beirut on July 30 and Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31? How will Israel respond to what will presumably be a coordinated Hezbollah-Iranian attack? Most alarming, will these actions tip the Middle East into the full-scale regional war feared ever since Hamas’s October 7 attack and the start of the massive Israeli military campaign in Gaza?
The post-October 7 escalatory cycle of violence between Israel and Hezbollah inevitably provokes comparisons to the 34-day Israel-Hezbollah war of 2006, when I served as U.S. ambassador to Lebanon. But the 2006 example, while devastating (with widespread destruction and displacement, and about 1,200 Lebanese and 165 Israelis killed), is grossly inadequate to describe the current peril. Both the Israelis and Hezbollah have studied and learned from the 2006 war, on the assumption that another war is inevitable and that each side must be better prepared. Unlike the situation with Hamas before October 7, Israel has fully understood the potential lethality of Hezbollah’s weaponry and methods and has for years focused on disrupting and countering the weapons flows from Iran via Syria to Hezbollah.
Hezbollah is also stronger militarily and politically than in 2006. As has been widely reported, its tunnel network has expanded, and its arsenals, dispersed across Lebanon, are exponentially larger, with more numerous and more advanced weaponry that can reach virtually all of Israel. Syria’s civil war has, since 2012, provided on-the-ground training for Hezbollah fighters, who, battled-experienced, now resemble a regular army.
Politically, in July 2006, many Lebanese reacted in outrage to Hezbollah’s unprovoked infiltration into Israel and the abduction of two Israeli soldiers, actions that triggered an instantaneous war that destroyed Lebanese hopes for a peaceful, tourist-filled, lucrative summer. Whether sincere or a postwar attempt at public relations, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah sensed the imperative to apologize for initiating the war. Now, given Israel’s 10-month unrelenting military campaign in Gaza, the ongoing low-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah, and the assassination of Hezbollah and Iranian leaders, even those Lebanese who hope that a full-scale war never materializes may not blame Hezbollah to the same degree as they did in 2006, if war does break out. In addition, Hezbollah’s grip on Lebanese political life is tighter than ever.
Unlike today, July 2006 offered no waiting time for civilians to relocate. With Beirut’s airport bombed and its air and maritime space blockaded from the war’s first day, approximately 15,000 American citizens were evacuated in what was then one of the largest U.S. government non-combatant evacuations in history. This year, with increasing urgency, foreign embassies in Beirut have advocated that their citizens depart Lebanon by commercial means while still available.
Most seriously, the broader context has changed since 2006. The conditions that inhibited the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war from escalating into a regional conflagration have evaporated as Iran’s “axis of resistance” has solidified. While Hamas’s and Hezbollah’s tactics in 2006 might have been similar, they did not claim to be pursuing coordinated agendas. In January 2006, Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections in Gaza and dragged the territory to war with its June 25, 2006, kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. But this was not linked to Hezbollah’s abductions that triggered the July 2006 war in Lebanon. Israel’s military response to these separate kidnappings did not have the deadly reinforcing logic and spiraling of today’s violence.
As for Iran, while Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad barked out a steady drumbeat of vile statements about Israel and Jews in 2006, Iran’s anti-Israel bite was exercised through proxies that did not have the same sophistication, lethality, and geographic scope of Iran’s proxies today. Yemen’s Houthis had been engaged in a series of military conflicts with Yemen’s government under then-President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who in the spring of 2006 offered amnesty to some Houthi fighters before skirmishes resumed the following year. Any relationship between Iran and the Houthis in 2006 threatened neither global shipping nor Tel Aviv. In Iraq, 2006 was a particularly bloody year between Shia and Sunni militias, with both focused on domestic slaughter, not drone attacks on Israel. In Damascus, Bashar al-Assad was licking his wounds from Syria’s humiliating expulsion from Lebanon the previous year after being blamed for the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, limiting Assad’s appetite for adventures that could further damage Syrian prestige.
In 2006, solidarity with the Palestinians from any of these groups was confined mostly to rhetorical support. Today, any or all could participate in turning the current situation into a full-scale war. For their own reasons, Hezbollah, Iran, and Israel each probably hopes to calibrate its military actions to avoid a full-scale war. But escalatory cycles are hard to control in situations such as today’s, where no precedents exist and previous unwritten rules of the game—such as tit-for-tat geographically limited and low-casualty strikes between Hezbollah and Israel—have been discarded. Miscalculations that accelerate escalatory violence can occur: the July 27 strike on Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights was presumably intended for a military target, not a Druze soccer field where 12 children and teenagers were slaughtered.
The United States, however, is far better prepared to defend its interests than in 2006. The Hezbollah abductions that provoked the 2006 war caught the U.S. government by surprise, and it took over a week before military assets were available to assist in the evacuation and to protect U.S. personnel. As we witnessed in April, the United States has deployed its military and its diplomacy to build an effective coalition to help reduce the impact of attacks from Iran and its allies, partners, and proxies.
Compared to 2006, the entire region is in dangerous, uncharted territory. A cease-fire/hostage release/humanitarian surge agreement for the Gaza Strip would facilitate urgent diplomacy from the Biden administration and others to de-escalate current tensions. But the clock to war and the clock to a cease-fire do not seem to be synchronized."
10,Syria normalization: The failure of defensive diplomacy,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/syria-normalization-the-failure-of-defensive-diplomacy/,Steven Heydemann,"August 2, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"In late May, Saudi Arabia appointed its first ambassador to Syria since it closed its embassy in Damascus 12 years ago. The Saudi ambassador’s return was only the latest step by the Arab states to normalize relations with the Assad regime. In 2018, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) became the first to reestablish ties with Damascus (though it only sent an ambassador to Syria in January 2024). The UAE’s move launched the rehabilitation of a regime that has been treated as a regional pariah since 2011 due to its brutal repression of mass protests. Other regional actors followed in its footsteps, including Jordan and Bahrain, but normalization only acquired real momentum in the wake of a devastating earthquake that hit southern Turkey and northern Syria in February 2023. Just months later, in May, the Arab League voted to restore Syria’s membership, ending a suspension dating back to 2011. In addition, several Arab states, including Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Lebanon, and Egypt established an Arab Liaison Committee on Syria to negotiate Syria’s further return to the Arab fold, including, potentially, providing Syria with badly needed financial support. Since then, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has again routinely participated in regional forums, including a November 2023 emergency summit on Gaza where he decried Israeli violence toward Palestinians—never mind his direct complicity in the brutal murder of hundreds of thousands of Syrian civilians.
Syria’s neighbors began normalizing their relations with Damascus after years of isolation and punitive sanctions failed to bring about a change in the Assad regime’s behavior, and as their concerns mounted about the spillover effects of Syria’s economic crisis for regional stability. Perhaps carrots, they argued, in the form of a step-for-step approach that would offer Assad incentives, might achieve what a policy heavy on sticks had not. Three issues loomed especially large on the Arab agenda: the need to create conditions that would permit the safe return of refugees; ending or at least curtailing the production and smuggling of Captagon, a narcotic that was flooding into Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries; and the possibility that a return to the Arab fold, along with Gulf money, might temper Iran’s influence in Syria.
A year later, what has normalization wrought? It has extended recognition and legitimacy to a murderous regime but in every other respect has been a failure. Arab regimes have taken unilateral steps with no reciprocal moves from Assad. Normalization led to no discernable progress toward the objectives sought by members of the Arab Liaison Committee. Refugees forced back into Syria from Lebanon are subject to detention and torture. The vast majority are unwilling to risk voluntary return. Huge quantities of Captagon continue to flow across Syria’s borders, with the direct support and involvement of leading regime figures including the president’s brother, Maher al-Assad. In the absence of any serious attempt by the regime to crack down on smuggling, Jordan has attacked production facilities inside Syria, shot down drug-carrying drones, and deployed its military to confront armed smuggling gangs that attempt to break through the border. Nor has a step-for-step strategy been any more effective in diluting Iranian influence in Damascus. In the face of Assad’s intransigence, last year’s cautious optimism has given way to a grim recognition of the limits of normalization and the depth of the Assad regime’s obstinacy. On May 7, 2024, one year to the day of the Arab League’s restoration of Syria’s membership, the Arab Liaison Committee on Syria suspended its meetings. While a future meeting in Baghdad has been announced, no date has been set.
Its failures notwithstanding, all indications are that Arab regimes are not yet prepared to rethink their engagement with the Assad regime. Instead, they have normalized normalization as a form of politics as usual. Not only did Saudi Arabia return a diplomatic delegation to Damascus in late May, but it also flouted U.S. sanctions to send Syria the spare parts it needed to keep its severely degraded fleet of civilian planes in the air. Flights between Damascus and Riyadh have also resumed. Indeed, as collective negotiations floundered, Arab regimes have shifted course, focusing instead on the development of bilateral ties to advance their particular interests. Even prior to Syria’s reinstatement to the Arab League, Oman and Syria established an Oman-Syria Joint Committee. Iraq’s prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, visited Damascus in mid-2023—the first such visit in over 10 years—while Syria’s foreign minister, Faisal Mikdad, has more recently held discussions on strengthening bilateral ties with counterparts from Egypt, Bahrain, and the UAE.
While Syria continues to participate in regional summits, including the most recent Arab League meeting in Manama, there is little question that Assad prefers dealing with neighboring states on a bilateral rather than a multilateral basis. Not least, this approach enables Assad to prioritize his diplomatic outreach. Signaling his relative disregard for Jordan’s priorities—Amman has been an especially vocal critic of the Assad regime’s involvement with the Captagon trade and is said to have led efforts to suspend the work of the Arab Liaison Committee—Jordanian-Syrian ties have been cooler than those between the regime and the Arab states in the Gulf. None of this implies that neighboring regimes have set aside their deep distrust of Assad. Indeed, the Gulf regimes prefer to define their approach to Syria as engagement or non-isolation rather than normalization. For their part, Syrian officials quietly complain about the Gulf regimes’ refusal to provide substantial financial support to Damascus.
For those who view the isolation and sanctioning of the Assad regime as a necessary response to its conduct—its documented role in mass violence and crimes against humanity that include over 300 known uses of chemical weapons, its continued refusal to provide information on the fate of more than 125,000 detainees held in a prison system that Human Rights Watch has described as a “torture archipelago,” its systematic theft of property from the forcibly displaced, its role in the Captagon trade—normalization has shown itself to be a lose-lose outcome. It rewards the regime’s criminality, erodes prospects for accountability, and facilitates sanctions avoidance. If there is a long game lurking behind this “something for nothing” strategy, it has proven exceptionally elusive.
Moreover, persisting with normalization has pernicious consequences for regional and international actors. Neighboring governments working to reduce illicit narcotics flows will be stymied by the Assad regime’s refusal to crack down on the drug trade. Similarly, there is no reason to believe that the incentives held out in exchange for normalization will persuade the Assad regime to change course and create conditions conducive to the voluntary return of refugees. In both respects, Arab governments will pay a steep price for indulging in a normalization process that has been permissive to a fault in its courtship of the Assad regime. Beyond Syria’s neighbors, the rhetoric of normalization has given license for right-wing nativist leaders in Europe to press for the return of Syrian refugees and to reject Syrians’ asylum claims. In early June, officials from seven European countries—Austria, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Malta, and Poland—asserted that conditions in the country had “evolved” sufficiently to reconsider the status of Syrian refugees. More recently, a German court ruled that Syria is now safe for refugee return, a finding that flies in the face of realities on the ground. 
The obvious antidote to a strategy that bestows generous benefits on the Assad regime while gaining nothing in return is to stop it. It is time for regional governments to acknowledge the futility of normalization and change course. Along with the United States and its European partners, Syria’s neighbors need to reaffirm that the Assad regime will itself, directly, pay a steep price for its continued refusal to engage, whether on refugees, Captagon, or the larger issue of a pathway out of conflict consistent with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254. The Assad regime is not normal. Its neighbors are poorly served by pretending that it is.
For its part, the United States would be well served by more assertive efforts to reverse normalization and affirm the Assad regime’s pariah status. The administration should move now, before a transition in January, to deploy the full range of diplomatic tools at its disposal—including more robust economic diplomacy through third-party sanctions—to more firmly signal its intent actively to throw sand in the gears of a deeply flawed normalization process. To date, the administration has instead largely conceded even the limited leverage that Congress gave it through the Caesar Syrian Civilian Protection Act. It has done little more than express skepticism about normalization while making clear it would do nothing to oppose it. In March 2023, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Barbara Leaf said that the administration’s message has been “If you’re going to engage with the regime, get something for that.” With the evidence of normalization’s failure, it is past time for the administration to get off the sidelines, recover whatever leverage it can muster, push back on Senate obstruction of the Assad Regime Anti-Normalization Act, and make much wider use of the sanctions that President Donald Trump signed into law through the Caesar Act to deter third-parties from engaging with the Assad regime. The alternative is a continued slow-drip restoration of the Assad regime’s standing that exposes forcibly repatriated refugees to the regime’s violence, even as it enables the continued flow of Captagon out of Syria and ensures the continued suffering of ordinary Syrians."

During my decade at Brookings, Martin was director of the Saban Center for Middle East Policy, vice president for Foreign Policy, and then (after I became a Nonresident Senior Fellow) he became Brookings’s executive vice president. Over those years, and beyond, he was a terrific friend, mentor, and colleague to so many of us, and especially to me.
Martin was a passionate believer, advocate, and gifted practitioner in our craft. He believed in mentoring the next generation, in investing in young scholars and giving them the tools to carry forward our tradition of applied scholarship.
He taught us all so much about our world. He taught us how to capture big ideas; how to present the essence of peace-making and self-governance; and how to embrace opportunities with energy, optimism, intelligence, and grace.
Martin was a master in cultivating and sustaining relationships. That includes learning how to have frank conversations that inspire people to find solutions. It also included extending kindness to people in moments of need.

The months prior to the study group session had seen a dramatic escalation of hostilities in the Middle East. American soldiers and diplomats had come under increased attack by Iran-backed militias in Iraq, Syria, and most recently Jordan, while Houthi rebels in Yemen were threatening maritime traffic through the Red Sea. The United States responded with military force in both cases. But there remained confusion regarding the exact legal basis for its actions and how far the president could act before he needed to seek authorization from Congress.
The study group was joined by two outside experts for the session:
Tess Bridgeman, a senior fellow at NYU Law School’s Reiss Center on Law and Security, co-editor in chief of Just Security, and former Deputy Legal Adviser to the National Security Council during the Obama administration; and

The event’s purpose was to generate a discussion on the role of international expertise and international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) in a localization frame, a topic mostly absent in considerations of locally led development.
An initial essay by Brookings scholar George Ingram, serving as background for the roundtable, poses three framing questions:
Is there a role for international expertise and entities in the localization frame, and if so, what is that role?
Can USAID, other donors, and intermediary organizations create structures and operating dynamics that provide global experience and expertise in ways that respect and support local actors being in control of priority setting, design, and execution?
In what ways can USAID modify its procurement processes to facilitate participation of local and national Southern organizations?
Because no one observer can represent the diversity of views on locally led development, and in order to broaden the conversation and audience beyond those at the April session, participants in the roundtable were invited to write follow-on commentaries on the topic.

The golden rule of international politics is for nations not to speak openly about each other’s elections, but it is no secret that in Europe, where democracies have thrived for decades, Europeans prefer Biden’s reelection. This decision is strategic and based on values.

South Korea’s National Intelligence Service has since confirmed Hamas’s possession and use of North Korean-made weapons against Israel. Although there is no firm evidence linking direct weapons sales between North Korea and Hamas, recent accounts of North Korean arms in the hands of nonstate armed actors (NSAAs) such as Hamas and the Russian-based Wagner Group have drawn renewed attention to North Korea’s long-standing involvement in the global illicit arms trade.
North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs have attracted far greater attention than its complicity in arms trafficking, but the two issues remain linked. To raise funds for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs while averting sanctions, North Korea must rely on its illicit trade and financial networks. The Workers’ Party of North Korea’s Central Committee Bureau 39 (also known as Office 39) is tasked with raising funds for the regime. This includes illicit trade involving drugs, counterfeit money, cryptocurrency, and wildlife (ivory in particular) in addition to weapons sales.
Escalating conflict in the Middle East and Russia’s prolonged war in Ukraine will only increase demand from both state and nonstate actors for low-cost weapons which North Korea can provide as the regime circumnavigates sanctions. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s incentive is to ramp up weapons production and raise revenue for his own military, and he exhibits no qualms in directly or indirectly proliferating weapons to NSAAs. The international community may not be able to completely halt North Korean weapons production, but it must take measures to better track and monitor North Korean illicit arms trafficking and better enforce U.N. sanctions that prohibit United Nations member states from procuring North Korean weapons.
Ties to nonstate armed actors in the Middle East
North Korea’s connections to NSAAs date back to the Cold War when North Korea itself was engaged in a strategy of what scholar Benjamin Young refers to as “guerilla internationalism.” As a revolutionary state, Young argues that North Korea was “committed to the ethos of guerilla fighting and assisting non-state actors in their own struggles for sovereignty and independence.” The regime provided communist insurgents and anti-colonial liberation movements with training and weapons.
In the post-Cold War period, this support expanded to Islamist militant groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas. North Korea also provided weapons to state actors such as Iran, Syria, Yemen, and Lebanon. For instance, during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, North Korea provided Iran with Scud B missiles, antitank weapons, anti-aircraft systems, rocket launchers, and other small arms. In the mid-2000s, North Korea supplied weapons and parts to Hezbollah by routing them through Iran and then assembling them in Syria before they were finally shipped to Lebanon.
In another example from 2015, Houthi militants fired 20 Scud-C missiles into Saudi Arabia that were identical to North Korea’s Hwasong-6 missile. As Samuel Ramani of the Royal United Services Institute argues, the Houthis likely captured the Scuds during battle against the Yemeni Armed Forces, which had purchased them from North Korea in 2002. Although there is no confirmation of North Korean weapons deliveries to the Houthis, a 2019 United Nations Panel of Experts report cites North Korean attempts to supply small arms and military equipment to the Houthis through arms traffickers in Syria.
North Korea and the Wagner Group
Resurging Russia-North Korea military ties, including reported arms shipments to the Wagner Group during the early phases of the war in Ukraine in 2022, have drawn greater scrutiny on North Korean illicit weapons. In December 2022, U.S. officials stated that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) had delivered missiles to the Wagner Group. Although North Korean weapons were unlikely to affect battlefield dynamics in Ukraine, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield expressed concern that such arms deals could fund North Korea’s ballistic missile and nuclear programs: “Wagner’s purchase of weapons from the DPRK to wreak destruction in Ukraine also contributes to instability on the Korean peninsula by giving the DPRK funds it can use to further develop its prohibited weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.”
The death of former Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, and the warming of North Korea-Russia ties since September 2023, has lessened the need for either country to go through the Wagner Group to procure weapons for Russia. In recent months, several reports have emerged indicating an uptick in artillery shells and up to 2.5 million rounds of ammunition traversing from North Korea into Russia.
That said, both Russia and North Korea may still find it convenient to retain Wagner as a weapons transfer node. The new commander of the Wagner Group, Anton Yelizarov, recently suggested that Wagner might merge with the Russian National Guard or Russia’s Africa Corps. Likewise, British intelligence officials stated that Wagner troops would be used to “reinforce Russia’s war effort in Ukraine and expand Russian influence in Africa.” If so, African countries, such as Libya and Sudan where both North Korea and Wagner have operated, might offer an easy point of entry for North Koreans to smuggle arms to Russia. In various African countries, sanctions enforcement tends to be lax. In turn, an increase in North Korean-made weapons circulating across Asia, Africa, and the Middle East will likely result in more of these weapons falling into the hands of NSAAs such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis.
Measures to curb North Korean weapons trade
Curbing North Korea’s illicit arms trade is imperative for two reasons. First, North Korean missiles and munitions are tied to bad actors who want to harm the United States and/or its allies which in turn fuels violence and regional instability. Although most NSAAs such as the Wagner Group, Hamas, Hezbollah, or the Houthis procure weapons through their respective patrons, Russia and Iran, North Korean-made weapons are also proliferating to NSAAs. Blocking North Korea’s weapons trade will help reduce the supply of weapons reaching NSAAs.
Second, North Korea’s boost in illicit arms deals provides a lifeline for the cash-strapped Kim regime. As argued by University of Sydney Professor Justin Hastings, North Korea is a “most enterprising country.” The Kim regime will capitalize on both state and nonstate actors’ growing demand for ballistic missiles, small arms, and other weapons rising from the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. In addition to crypto cybertheft, crystal meth production, and other illicit activities, arms sales will help the regime generate revenue and fund its own growing missile, space, cyber, and nuclear programs. Bloomberg News reported that artillery shell sales to Russia alone could generate $1 billion in revenue for the Kim regime.
Despite numerous sanctions levied against North Korea that prohibit and penalize foreign assistance to North Korea’s missile and nuclear program (e.g., U.N. Security Council Resolution 1718, U.S. Executive Order 13382, the Arms Export Control Act, and the Export Administration Act), sanctions are no longer effectively enforced due to Russian and Chinese political support for North Korea.
Nevertheless, the United States and the international community must push harder to monitor and disrupt North Korea’s illicit trade and financial networks and enforce sanctions that are already in place. New advances in satellite and artificial intelligence technology might be explored to better track North Korean shipments and financial transactions. For example, some experts have suggested moving away from “list-checking” sanctioned entities and relying more on big data using sophisticated algorithmic methods and machine learning to track patterns of illicit North Korean activity.
Additionally, more work needs to be done to track North Korean individuals and companies linked to Office 39 to staunch the flow of money back to the regime. Although the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control remains vigilant in investigating illicit North Korean financial networks, a U.N. Panel of Experts (POE) found that front companies such as Glocom, based out of Malaysia, “used an extensive network of individuals, companies and offshore bank accounts to procure, market and sell arms and related materiel” for North Korea. The POE recommended sanctioning Glocom in 2016, yet it continues to conduct business selling communications technology to militaries in Africa and Asia.
North Korean small and light weapons exports to countries “striving for human security and political stability” also deserve greater scrutiny. As one 2022 study found, despite the decrease in North Korean arms imported by U.N. member states from 2009-2011, weapons sales have begun climbing again since 2015. Between 2015-2021, Trinidad and Tobago, El Salvador, Niger, and Fiji all imported over $10,000 in North Korean small arms. The international community can pressure, discourage, and/or shame countries that knowingly procure North Korean weapons that contribute to violence and crime.
Lastly, increased knowledge and transparency regarding North Korea’s illicit arms networks may help pressure North Korea by helping global actors interdict North Korean arms shipments headed toward conflict areas. Initiatives such as the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) which focus more narrowly on weapons of mass destruction (WMD) had brought some success in blocking the transport of WMD-related materials to North Korea in the 2000s. Reviving the PSI and encouraging the 106 signatory countries to renew their efforts at preventing the circulation of WMD-related materials, including ballistic missiles, should also be considered."
19,Biden's unspectacular but solid national security record,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/bidens-unspectacular-but-solid-national-security-record/,Michael E. O’Hanlon,"January 30, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Three years into his presidency, U.S. President Joe Biden’s hopes that his lifetime of foreign policy experience would make national security a natural political strength continue to encounter rough seas. After a reasonably good start in early 2021, the botched Afghanistan withdrawal and unseemly unveiling of the AUKUS deal with the U.K. and Australia (at France’s expense) took the sheen off his young presidency. The war in Ukraine and more recently the Middle East conflict have since taken further tolls. The latter tragedies may not have been his fault, but an incumbent is rewarded or penalized for what happens on their watch, fairly or not.
However, despite the mistakes and blemishes, Biden’s national security track record is better than widely perceived. (Fewer than 40 percent of Americans give him good grades in foreign policy in most recent polls, while nearly 60 percent typically give him an unfavorable assessment.) The key reason is this: The country is still reasonably safe, and great-power relations, while surely fraught, do not have the United States on the brink of war. As I argued in 2022, unlike his predecessor and likely 2024 challenger, Donald Trump, who took the nation closer to war against North Korea in 2017 than is commonly appreciated, and unlike certain prominent Republicans who have suggested the United States consider recognizing Taiwan independence even at heightened risk of war with China, Biden has been calm and de-escalatory, yet resolute on core matters of national interest."

The findings are potentially consequential for shifting public perceptions of President Joe Biden and his administration.
Three takeaways
First, Americans strongly support defending human rights globally. When asked whether defending human rights globally should be a goal of American foreign policy, 65% of respondents said yes, including 60% of Republicans and 78% of Democrats. In addition, 65% of both young respondents and respondents ages 35 years and older said defending human rights globally should be a goal."
21,"Bridging the gaps: Allison Minor on US foreign policy, conflict prevention, and fragility",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/bridging-the-gaps-allison-minor-on-us-foreign-policy-conflict-prevention-and-fragility/,"Allison Minor, Junjie Ren","October 18, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Junjie Ren: You’ve worked across multiple U.S. government agencies and international organizations. What were some key experiences that motivated you and shaped your approach to conflict prevention?
Allison Minor: I joined the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in January 2015 and was assigned to work on Yemen. It just so happened that this was right as the conflict in the country was breaking out, and I had a front-row seat to witness how the U.S. bureaucracy was adapting to that emerging conflict, both operationally and strategically. It pushed me to think more rigorously about what a better approach might look like, both specifically in the Yemen case and more broadly.
Since then, I’ve worked on Yemen from different parts of the U.S. government on and off for the past decade. It has been difficult to watch how, over time, resolving the conflict became harder and more costly. And, of course, this kind of dynamic is not limited to Yemen—I believe we’re seeing a similar dynamic unfolding in Sudan now. My interest in conflict prevention stems very much from this personal experience and a genuine desire to find more effective approaches.
The existing conflict prevention literature contains rich discussions of the best technical approaches to conflict prevention globally, but I felt there was not sufficient discussion of the practical constraints to implementing those approaches in large bureaucracies like the U.S. government.
Another motivation was the growing gulf I sensed between the international development community and the U.S. foreign policy community around conflict and fragility. Within the international development community, there’s a broad recognition of the importance of addressing conflict and fragility. The world’s poor increasingly live in fragile states, and violent conflict now poses one of the greatest threats to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Meanwhile, in the U.S. foreign policy community, we’re seeing a pivot away from focusing on fragile states like Iraq and Afghanistan in favor of addressing major power competition and global challenges like climate change. I worry that this will create a divide between the development and U.S. foreign policy communities, which will make it much harder to promote effective conflict prevention.
Junjie Ren: You’ve described conflict prevention as an ambiguous term. How do you approach the concept of conflict prevention in the context of global governance?
Allison Minor: I believe, first and foremost, that we need to be much more precise and modest when we talk about the United States’ ability to prevent conflict in other countries. When we exaggerate the influence of foreign actors like the U.S., we often underestimate the importance and agency of local actors. Of course, a major power like the U.S. can shape the trajectory of conflict in other countries, and that can be for better or for worse. But I would argue that the United States’ ability to do so is grounded in its foreign policy posture and major policy decisions made at pivotal moments, not in individual foreign policy tools like an economic assistance program.
In a Yemen case study I conducted while at Brookings, I examined the opportunities the U.S. had to prevent the Yemen war between 2011 and 2015, and it underscored this conclusion. In another paper called “Implementing Prevention,” I argue that an effective U.S. conflict prevention initiative must focus on changing U.S. policymaking processes. Specifically, these processes must be more adaptive and responsive, and officials need to prioritize conflict prevention over short-term policy imperatives.
It is particularly important that countries like the United States improve their approach to conflict prevention in the current geopolitical environment, because we are seeing increasing impediments to the U.N. mechanisms that have played an important role in conflict prevention and resolution in the past. For example, gridlock in the U.N. Security Council can impede the effectiveness of special envoys, who typically depend on the Council for their mandates."

O’Hanlon,"February 15, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent “invitation” to Russian President Vladimir Putin to have his way militarily against NATO allies falling short of their burden-sharing goals was not only mean-spirited—it was downright dangerous. Not only for them but for us as well.
It is entirely possible that Putin could interpret Trump’s comments literally and, should Trump win reelection this fall, attempt an attack on an American ally next year. Perhaps he would test Norway’s northern border with a probing attack. Or he could fire missiles at Belgium or the Netherlands, two more countries that fall well short of the NATO minimum standard of spending 2 percent of GDP on their militaries—and thus qualifying for Trump’s wrath. Or in an echo of an earlier confrontation almost a decade ago, but this time with roles reversed, maybe he would authorize a shootdown of a Turkish aircraft patrolling near Russian airspace. Or maybe Putin would attack a neighboring Baltic state even though Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania all do meet the 2 percent threshold, concluding that Trump’s contempt for NATO is so profound that he wouldn’t respond there either."
23,Networked authoritarianism and economic resilience in Syria,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/networked-authoritarianism-and-economic-resilience-in-syria/,"Karam Shaar, Steven Heydemann","August 26, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",RESEARCH,"For the Biden administration, Syria’s ongoing conflict is a minor irritant that occasionally forces itself onto the agenda but for the most part can be ignored. Containing the conflict’s spill-over effects—whether in the form of refugees, narcotics smuggling, friction with Turkey over U.S. support for Kurdish actors and the presence of U.S. forces, or the humanitarian effects of economic collapse—defines the limits of the administration’s interest in Syria. The Islamic State’s resurgence is largely outsourced to Kurdish partners. The diplomatic commitment that would be needed for progress toward the comprehensive political solution set out in U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254—now almost a decade old—is no longer seen as a priority. Even the administration’s opposition to the normalization of the Assad regime has become pro forma.
As Syria slips from official and public view, however, less and less attention is directed toward the Assad regime, how it keeps itself afloat, and how recent shifts in the tactics it uses to insulate itself from both economic sanctions and an increasingly restive society are likely to fuel the effects that the United States and its allies view as most threatening. These include further increases in refugee flows, a worsening humanitarian crisis, and renewed waves of radicalization. Out of public view, and even as Syria continues to be plagued by many different vectors of crisis, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his innermost circles are reorganizing how they intervene in and manage the country’s economy.
In recent years, Assad has deepened his grip over crucial economic sectors, using networks of frontmen and women to position himself as a powerful economic actor and give himself and his regime the space to resist the use of economic pressure as an instrument of coercive diplomacy. This shift, intentionally obscured by the regime and overlooked by its adversaries, is evident from a close analysis of the economic networks that Assad has constructed around himself. Unpacking these networks and their implications is essential for the United States and its allies to ensure the effectiveness of policies intended to isolate and hold accountable a regime that is directly complicit in some of the worst war crimes and crimes against humanity of the 21st century.
Economic networks have long been central to the regime’s survival strategy. Since the start of the conflict, however, the Assad regime has placed increasing weight on those economic networks. Business cronies closely tied to Assad have played crucial roles in sanctions avoidance, securing essential goods, concealing assets, and enabling the elite to maintain its privileged lifestyle in the face of economic collapse. Over time, Assad and his inner circle have become adept in managing crony networks to keep the regime afloat, adjusting who’s in and who’s out to ensure that the money continues to flow.
As Assad discovered in 2019, however, when his cousin and once-trusted bag man Rami Makhlouf resisted turning over assets accumulated in part on Bashar’s behalf, cronies have minds of their own. To recover what was reported to be billions in assets, Assad oversaw the systematic dismantling of Makhlouf’s economic holdings. In the aftermath of his confrontation with Makhlouf, Assad has moved to secure direct control over the former’s economic empire, dramatically restructuring the informal networked ecosystem he depends on. These changes, visible for the first time through our analysis of firm-level micro-data and open-source research, offer important insights into the inner workings of the upper reaches of the Assad regime and how conflict has transformed Syria’s political economy. This restructuring helps to explain Assad’s economic resilience in the midst of the economic crisis, why he has rejected step-for-step diplomacy despite its promised economic payoffs, and how the regime has been able to navigate a vast web of sanctions that directly target regime networks—networks that countries imposing sanctions and struggling to reach a political settlement fail to understand.
Understanding how Assad is changing Syria’s political economy is not a small matter. The benefits that accrue to Assad as a result of his new economic roles influence his strategic calculus. Feeling more confident about his own economic prospects affects how the regime engages with regional and international actors. It has a bearing on what the regime might be prepared to offer, or withhold, at the negotiating table. It also matters in determining who wins and who loses in Syria’s wartime economy and any potential reconstruction, issues of enormous relevance for the future of the Syrian business community. For the United States and other countries that continue to reject the path of normalization, exposing these networks sheds light on the architecture of corruption in Assad’s Syria and the policies needed to counteract it.
Background: Intransigence and resilience amid crisis
More than 13 years after the onset of Syria’s conflict, the country’s economy remains mired in crisis. Since 2011, the lira has lost more than 99% of its prewar value. In an assessment published in May 2024, the World Bank found that household welfare has collapsed, along with trade, agriculture, and manufacturing. More than 90% of Syrians now live in poverty. In its desperation to reduce spending, the Assad regime has added to ordinary Syrians’ hardships by cutting subsidies and tightening its grip over the economy, provoking sporadic protests across the country, even in areas that have remained quiet for a long time, including Damascus. In 2020, economic grievances ignited protests in southern Syria that have since morphed into a localized insurgency. Just as ominous from the regime’s perspective is a parallel decline in humanitarian assistance. At the same time, the support from key patrons continues to wane, with Iran’s oil exports to Syria at their lowest levels since 2020.
How is the Assad regime coping with economic collapse? In the face of withering conditions, it has turned its back on arguably its best prospect for economic relief and a start to economic recovery. Just over a year ago, Syria was reinstated as a full member of the Arab League, a significant step in its return to the Arab fold. In extending recognition and legitimacy to the regime, Arab states hoped to jump-start a “step-for-step” process of normalization that would include the provision of sorely needed financial support in exchange for the regime’s cooperation on issues of vital importance to its neighbors, notably stemming a flood of narcotics flowing out of Syria into the region, and concrete steps to facilitate the safe return of refugees. To advance negotiations about the steps Syria must take and what it would get in exchange, the Arab League established a Liaison Committee, including representatives from Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Egypt.
As it turned out, the hopes of Syria’s neighbors were ill-founded. On May 7, 2024, exactly one year after Syria’s readmission to the Arab League, the Arab Liaison Committee suspended its meetings. Until now, despite the prospect of financial support, the Assad regime has refused to offer meaningful steps to address regional concerns. Its recalcitrance underscored the failure of the step-for-step approach and the limits of normalization to incentivize change in the regime’s conduct. It also made clear that the suffering of Syrians is a price the regime is willing to pay to avoid compromise.
The question raised by the regime’s rejectionist stance is why. What explains its refusal to accept even token shifts in policy if doing so would bring badly needed economic relief? Many factors play a role. Assad and his inner circle have long viewed any form of concession as signaling weakness. His regime, like his father’s, has mastered the art of foot-dragging to outlast adversaries at the bargaining table. Moreover, the willingness of Arab regimes to keep normalization alive despite its failure to deliver has persuaded Assad that he can get something for nothing. All these factors matter, but there’s more happening beneath the surface: Assad is reorganizing economic networks to bring key sectors of the economy under his direct control.
Assad’s economic networks
Through close analysis of micro-data on company formation in Syria and publicly available government statements and news articles compiled by the Observatory of Political and Economic Networks (OPEN),1 it is now clear that Assad is engineering changes in the informal economic networks that have long underpinned the country’s political economy. Since 2020, Assad has moved to reduce the unpredictability associated with his reliance on the cronies who own firms that were among the regime’s leading sources of revenue—alongside narcotics smuggling and aid diversion. To all outward appearances, what Assad seems to have learned from the Makhlouf episode of 2019-2021 was that only by centralizing and simplifying network structures and taking a leading, albeit hidden, role in the firms that underpin networks can he guarantee a reliable stream of revenues that flow directly into the president’s personal coffers. The peak cronies that rose to positions of influence since 2011, businessmen like Samer Foz, Muhammad Hamsho, and Hussam Qatarji, continue to occupy central roles in crony networks. Yet they increasingly operate alongside the networks controlled by Assad himself and his handpicked fronts and cut-outs. Assad seems convinced that instead of relying on cronies, he is better served by carving out a direct role as Syria’s dominant economic, as well as political, actor.
Assad’s newly minted networks and their reliance on business fronts are distinctly different from the economic networks that developed around traditional cronies. While cronies have physical offices, work addresses, and public profiles that they care about and promote, fronts have none. Despite the business empires that documents suggest the fronts control, they are ghosts to the public at large. In fact, among the five fronts identified here, only one, Yasar Ibrahim, has a publicly available photo, in contrast to cronies who often go to great lengths to cultivate public brands. Furthermore, while cronies provide political and economic support in exchange for the preferential treatment they receive from state institutions, enriching themselves in the process, business fronts have nothing to offer in exchange for the privileged positions they occupy. Their mere existence as “businessmen” rests on one factor alone: Assad’s approval. In fact, one of the five business fronts mentioned here is a state employee. Yasar Ibrahim is an adviser to Assad and head of the economic and financial office of the presidency. Further, the cronies’ scope of economic activities is not limited to those they undertake on the regime’s behalf, whereas fronts occupy more limited positions that more directly serve Assad’s economic interests.
The emergence and rapid growth of these new economic networks are only visible through close analysis of firm-level and investor-level data that sheds light on the formation of businesses by individuals with little to no prior business presence but with close ties to Assad. These ties are displayed in the following interactive figure. The subset of OPEN’s database presented in the illustrative tool is sourced from the Syrian Gazette, official government announcements, the Damascus Stock Exchange, and open-source news articles. Further information about OPEN’s data model and sources can be found here."
24,What's in Biden's $850-billion defense budget proposal?,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/whats-in-bidens-850-billion-defense-budget-proposal/,"Michael E. O’Hanlon, Alejandra Rocha","March 15, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"President Joe Biden submitted his fiscal year (FY) 2025 budget proposal on March 11, including a request for $850 billion in discretionary budget authority for the Department of Defense. The new request represents a 4.1 percent increase from the FY 2023 enacted level—or a $34 billion increase.1 Once inflation is taken into account, however, that projected two-year growth totaling 4.1 percent turns into negative growth, given that aggregate inflation over the last two years totaled about 7 percent.
The Biden administration did not have much choice in the matter since Biden’s deal with then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in spring 2023 capped defense spending for FY 2025 at the requested level. The FY 2025 total grows to $895 billion if the National Nuclear Security Administration’s nuclear weapons activities (and a few other, smaller things) are also included; indeed, formally speaking, the “National Defense Budget” of the United States (called the 050 budget function by the Office of Management and Budget) includes those funds as well.
By any measure—but particularly in this election year and in this era of competing budget priorities—that is an enormous amount of money that will surely raise many eyebrows. The sum prompts questions about how it compares internationally and historically. And most importantly, it begs an exploration of its purpose. What is the money for? Why does the military cost this much? Why is it of its current size? And what is it intended to do?"
25,Will the vice presidential debate matter? A review of the modern debates,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/will-the-vice-presidential-debate-matter-a-review-of-the-modern-debates/,Elaine Kamarck,"September 30, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"The first televised presidential debate occurred in 1960 between Senators John Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Richard Nixon (R-Calif.). But the first vice presidential debate didn’t occur until 16 years later in 1976. In those 16 years, two vice presidents became presidents: the first, Lyndon B. Johnson, as the result of the assassination of President Kennedy and the second, Gerald Ford, as the result of the resignation of Richard Nixon. Suddenly, people wanted to know more about the vice presidential candidates, and today, the VP debate is a fixture of the presidential year.
Whether this year’s debate between Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz will matter is a question we will soon find out. But a review of the history of these debates finds that it’s hard to assess whether they matter or not.
The first vice presidential debate was between Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) and Sen. Walter Mondale (D-Minn.). Dole attacked the Democrats on crime— “If we added up the killed and wounded in Democrat wars in this century, it would be…enough to fill the city of Detroit.” In response, Mondale said Dole lived up to his reputation as a “hatchet man” for implying that major wars such as World War II (in which ironically Dole was a hero) were fought only at the whim of Democratic politicians. Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale won that election, but no one really thinks the VP debate made much difference.
The next vice presidential debate was in 1984, and it attracted a huge viewership since it involved the first woman vice presidential candidate, Rep. Geraldine Ferraro (D-N.Y.) versus Vice President George H.W. Bush. Bush referred to Ferraro as “Mrs.” instead of “congresswoman” and later added “This is serious business, but let me help you, Mrs. Ferraro…” Ferraro shot back with: “Let me just say, first of all, that I almost resent, Vice President Bush, your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy.” The audience erupted in spontaneous applause. “I have been a member of Congress for six years,” Ferraro continued, “I was there when the embassy was held hostage in Iran. I have been there, and I have seen what has happened in the past several months, 17 months with your administration.” The debate sensitized male politicians to the dangers of debating a woman and seeming to talk down to her. Nonetheless Reagan and Bush won the election in a landslide.
In 1988, curious voters tuned into the debate between Sen. Dan Quayle (R-Ind.) and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas). From the moment he bounded onto the stage at the Republican convention in New Orleans, Dan Quayle’s qualifications for office and his intelligence had been questioned. Quayle, trying to counter his image as a lightweight, invoked his youth, comparing himself to President Kennedy who had served the same amount of time in Congress as Quayle. But Bentsen was ready with a killer line: “Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you’re no Jack Kennedy.” Polls and pundits alike declared Bentsen the winner, but nonetheless, in November, the Bush-Quayle ticket won a solid victory over the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket.
The 1992 presidential race featured Gov. Bill Clinton (D-Ark.) versus President George H.W. Bush and a strong third-party candidate, the billionaire Ross Perot. That vice presidential debate is remembered not for the performance of Senator Al Gore (D-Tenn.) or for the performance of Vice President Dan Quayle but for the poor performance of Perot’s running mate, Admiral James Stockdale. Stockdale, who had had an impressive career in the military and in academia turned in one of the poorest performances ever in a debate. His opening line—“Who am I, why am I here?” became the butt of many jokes due to Stockdale’s weak and often confused demeanor on the debate stage. But it didn’t keep Perot from earning 19% of the vote, making him the most successful third-party candidate in U.S. history.
In 1996, Al Gore was the sitting vice president and he was running against former Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.), the Republican vice presidential nominee on Bob Dole’s ticket. The debate was regarded by all as very civil; Kemp did not use it to comment on President Clinton’s character, and Gore put in a strong performance. The Clinton-Gore ticket won.
The 2000 presidential election featured no sitting vice president. The Republican vice presidential candidate, former Rep. Dick Cheney (R-Wyo.), George Bush’s running mate, debated Al Gore’s running mate Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.). It too was a civilized and respectful debate. No one quotes any zingers from that debate, and it seemed to not have an influence on the overall race which ended up in a tie going all the way to the Supreme Court—and essentially made George W. Bush the winner.
By the time of the 2004 debate between sitting Vice President Dick Cheney and Democratic Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.), the civil tone of the previous two debates had disappeared. In front of a large audience of voters focused on the Iraq invasion, the economy, and the new issue of gay marriage, Cheney sought to highlight how inexperienced Edwards was—saying: “The first time I met you was when you walked on the stage tonight.” Edwards asked Cheney if he was “… willing to talk about the fact that [Cheney and his wife Lynne] have a gay daughter?” All in all, the VP debate didn’t seem to matter much—Bush and Cheney won reelection.
The 2008 presidential election featured the second woman to be nominated for vice president—Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska who ran with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) on the Republican ticket. She faced Senator Joe Biden (D-Del.) who was Sen. Barack Obama’s (D-Ill.) running mate. Nielsen Media Research stated it was watched by 70 million viewers—making it the most watched VP debate in history. By the time of the debate (October 2, 2008), Palin’s star had started to fade. On September 24 and 25, she had sat for in depth interviews with NBC anchor Katie Couric. Her inability to answer questions showed a stunning shallowness of her knowledge of things a would-be president should know and became fodder to late night television jokes. Biden, for his part, avoided talking down to Palin (as Bush before him had done to Ferraro) and showed great policy depth; in a-CNN Poll: 46% of watchers said Palin was qualified to be president, compared to 87% who said Biden was qualified. Palin’s vice presidential candidacy may be the one that contradicts the conventional wisdom. Political scientists found that her negative effect on the vote choice “was the largest of any vice presidential candidate in elections examined dating back to 1980.” The Obama-Biden ticket won a solid victory in November.
By the 2012 vice presidential debate, Barack Obama was president, Joe Biden was vice president, and they were running against former Utah Gov. Mitt Romney and his running mate, Rep, Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). This debate followed the first presidential debate in which Romney performed better than President Obama. The Obama campaign needed a boost and Joe Biden’s aggressive performance gave it that. While there were no famous one-liners, Biden attacked in his familiar folksy way— “With all due respect, that’s a bunch of malarkey. Not a single thing he said is accurate,” which helped put new energy into the Obama campaign.
In 2016, Hillary Clinton ran against Donald Trump, setting up a VP debate between Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) versus Gov. Mike Pence (R-Ind.). Gone were the days of civil debates. In fact, Kaine and Pence constantly interrupted each other, frustrating viewers and leading MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow to declare the debate was “incomprehensible” due to the number of times the candidates interrupted each other. But it didn’t seem to make any difference in the outcome—Trump won an electoral college victory and became president.
The 2020 VP debate was held in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pence and Harris stood 12 feet apart with a plexiglass wall in between them. In a preview of the issue that would become paramount three years later, both candidates were asked if they had discussed procedures about “presidential disability” with their running mates, given that Biden and Trump were both old. Neither answered the question directly. A CNN poll found that 59% of viewers thought Harris had won, while 39% said Pence did. And Ipso’s KnowledgePanel found that while the debate didn’t really change how people were planning to vote, Harris did improve her favorability ratings.
As we can see—it’s hard to judge the impact of vice presidential debates. They tend to blend into the overall narrative of the race. Dole came off as a “hatchet man,” and Quayle and Palin came off as not quite ready for prime time. Overall, with the exception (perhaps) of Sarah Palin, political scientists have concluded that vice presidential debates in general don’t have much of an effect on presidential elections.
But the debate between Vance and Walz is occurring in a race that is razor thin. With very few votes deciding the outcome, anything—including the vice presidential debate—could matter, which is why we will be watching."
26,"Artificial intelligence, international security, and the risk of war",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/artificial-intelligence-international-security-and-the-risk-of-war/,Michael E. O’Hanlon,"November 19, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Artificial intelligence (AI) will affect human society in countless ways, including in the realm of international security. However, I would like to focus on one specific matter: the possibility that AI may increase the risks of war breaking out. Specifically, I would like to offer a caution or warning to leaders in the United States, the People’s Republic of China, and everywhere around the world, in fact.
The caution that I offer is based on my reading of history. Specifically, wars often occur when the aggressor develops a theory of rapid and relatively easy victory. Often, such a theory is based in part on a new technology or set of technologies that the aggressor has developed and incorporated into its armed forces as well as its war plans. Believing it has acquired such a capability sooner than its adversary, the aggressor then attacks with an expectation of an easy victory. That could happen in the future with AI. Since AI can accelerate the pace of war, as well as attacks on command-and-control systems, it may be particularly prone to this danger; it could, for example, offer the perception of a possible path to quick decapitation of adversary leadership.
Take for example World War I. Benefiting from a marvelous railroad system and a world-class industrial base that had pumped out lots of weaponry, Germany became overconfident. Its infamous Schlieffen Plan for rapidly defeating France, then repurposing forces to fight Russia, was the result of this overconfidence. Political and military leaders convinced themselves that they had figured out a formula for rapid conquest of the enemy. Four years and 10 million fatalities later, Germany lost the war—and its country nearly collapsed.
Of course, some wars start without any expectation of quick success on the part of the initiator. Some causes are just and worth the sacrifice. Some pathological leaders like Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany in the 1930s are willing to fight hard and long because they lack ethics, compassion, and decency. But after his success with the blitzkrieg against France, even Hitler developed an unrealistic expectation of rapid success before attacking the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941 (that’s why he sent German troops deep into Russia without winter coats). By that point in World War II, he had developed such pride in German technology and martial prowess that he thought he could defeat virtually anyone.
Hitler wasn’t the only one who was wrong about the possibility of rapid conquest during World War II. Theorists of airpower like the Italian Giulio Douhet and the American Billy Mitchell believed that strategic bombing (with conventional or nuclear weapons) would quickly terrorize a population into submission. That did not happen when Germany bombed Britain in “the blitz” or when the United States and its allies bombed first Germany and then Japan.
Or consider the Korean War. First, the North Koreans were overconfident, and then so were the Americans. Maybe then the Chinese were too; I’m not sure. And it happened again in Vietnam, where the United States expected its high-technology edge, with helicopter mobility and strategic bombardment, to defeat the Viet Cong. We were wrong.
The same kind of thing happened again when the United States invaded Iraq in 2003 to overthrow Saddam Hussein: the Bush administration hoped that “shock and awe” from precision strike technologies foreshadowed a “cakewalk.” There did not occur, of course—even if the first part of the war, overthrowing Saddam, went fast.
Vladimir Putin made a similar mistake when invading Ukraine in 2022—perhaps based on the false expectation that it would go almost as easily as his clever seizure of Crimea with quickness, boldness, and “little green men” in 2014.
Yes, rapid victories do sometimes happen. But often they don’t—and then it’s too late to undo the war or pretend it never happened. Usually, in such cases, the resulting wars wind up dragging on for a long time. The great Chinese strategist Sun Tzu may have been right to argue that winning without fighting, or with only minimal fighting, is the best kind of victory. But most nations are not able to achieve such happy outcomes in war.
We need to remind ourselves that some partial advantage in AI in the future—whoever may believe they attain it—will not make future war easy or rapid victory predictable. That is not usually the nature of war."
27,Where US conflict prevention falls short and how to fix it,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/where-us-conflict-prevention-falls-short-and-how-to-fix-it/,Allison Minor,"September 18, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Policymakers have long called for stronger U.S. crisis prevention structures that can avert a conflict before it escalates, and the current global environment, in which states are scrambling to expand their influence while international norms and institutions intended to prevent conflict are faltering, is only increasing this imperative. Unsurprisingly, we are witnessing a surge in violent conflict globally. The United States lacks the ability to stabilize all violent conflicts, and it is not necessarily in its interests to do so. But some of these conflicts—whether in Gaza, Ukraine, or the Sahel—are exhausting U.S. resources, emboldening revisionist actors, and threatening U.S. national security interests, even if they don’t present an imminent threat to the homeland. The United States must be better at managing these threats.  
Research has demonstrated that preventative action is an efficient way to mitigate the risk of U.S. strategic overstretch and reduce violent conflict, especially when compared to costly and often ineffective efforts to stabilize a conflict that has already escalated. But implementing conflict prevention is extremely difficult. Preventative action faces inherent obstacles: individuals and organizations must overcome the natural tendency to focus their attention and resources on immediate threats and tame a bureaucratic bias against proactive action. These obstacles help explain why preventative action is often missing, too little, or too late.
In a recent paper—“Implementing prevention”—I propose a blueprint for a more practical, calibrated approach to implementing prevention within the U.S. government that is rooted in lessons learned from recent U.S. efforts and the realities of the U.S. bureaucracy. I examine the challenges facing the most ambitious U.S. conflict prevention initiative in recent years, the 2019 Global Fragility Act (GFA), and other prevention-oriented initiatives. I also use a case study of the U.S. failures to seize windows of opportunity to prevent the 2015 Yemen war to better understand how the United States’ ability to prevent conflict manifests in practice.
There are three elements that, in combination, are critical to an effective and practical conflict prevention approach, and which are lacking from existing conflict prevention initiatives:
1) Support for more adaptive, responsive U.S. foreign policymaking processes
The United States’ ability to mitigate the risk of conflict in other countries is typically rooted in significant policy decisions it makes at pivotal moments. In these cases, the United States must be able to quickly adapt its assumptions in the face of rapidly changing dynamics on the ground, weigh the medium-term costs of its decisions against immediate policy imperatives, elevate prevention as a priority, and mobilize the kind of senior-level attention necessary to enable decisive policy action. In my Yemen case study, I describe how the United States failed to weigh the significant medium-term consequences of the highly advantageous terms it supported for outgoing dictator Ali Abdullah Saleh in 2011, grasp the country’s collapsing political transition process in 2014 and the growing Houthi threat, and assess the consequences of its unqualified support for the Saudi-led coalition campaign in 2015 on Yemeni stability.
Standard U.S. policymaking processes—which were designed for the stable portfolios that make up the majority of U.S. bilateral relationships—instead tend to be slow and rigid, with a bias toward maintaining the status quo. Further, the United States often prioritizes global objectives like trade and counterterrorism (as was the case in Yemen) that may unintentionally exacerbate the risk of conflict. An effective conflict prevention initiative must provide the tools and authorities necessary to make policymaking processes more adaptive, responsive, and capable of challenging entrenched positions in the targeted countries. Doing so also requires strong support from policymakers across the foreign policy apparatus, which will only be possible if an initiative is actively helping advance top U.S. national security priorities.
Unfortunately, initiatives like the GFA often lack the necessary authorities and policymaker buy-in to influence U.S. foreign policy in the targeted countries. The decision to house the GFA in technical offices that lack authority over policymaking or all relevant foreign policy tools—particularly diplomatic engagement and security cooperation—and the relatively weak national security rationale for GFA efforts in the pilot countries all contribute to the constraints the GFA faces. Instead, the GFA is focused on foreign assistance projects that—in isolation—are incapable of shaping the trajectory of conflict at a national level. Experience from the U.S. atrocity prevention process and Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI), which were both hampered by weak policymaker buy-in, further underscores that a weak national security rationale will undermine the initiative’s impact, regardless of where it is institutionalized and how much initial support it has from senior U.S. officials or Congress. The State Department’s recently launched Policy Risk and Opportunity Planning group, which ties its planning exercises to countries with a defined, near-term national security imperative, provides a useful model for demonstrating a stronger strategic rationale and secure leadership support for preventative planning. However, it is not structured to alter existing policymaking processes in the targeted countries; instead, it provides a single point in a time planning exercise.
A more effective conflict prevention approach should be narrowly targeted toward conflicts that would explicitly threaten U.S. national security goals and where the United States has the influence and resources to positively shape the conflict’s trajectory. It should be overseen by a secretariat that coordinates staff from a series of offices across the U.S. government that have both formal authority over policymaking and technical expertise, with support from senior-level champions. Offices like the State Department’s Policy Planning Staff and the National Security Council’s Strategic Planning Directorate, which have global mandates for strategic planning and strong access to leadership, could play leading roles in such a secretariat. Finally, the initiative should establish practices that enable a critical assessment of existing U.S. policy in the targeted portfolios; integrate strategic foresight tools; develop a streamlined, whole-of-government strategic approach that elevates prevention and addresses trade-offs; and create regular opportunities for staff to challenge assumptions and identify new risks and opportunities.
2) A prevention pyramid: Balancing just-in-time and longer-term prevention with systemic reforms
The GFA and most other conflict prevention initiatives focus on long-term efforts that seek to address the underlying conditions that drive conflict, what experts call structural prevention. Such long-term efforts are most vulnerable to the inherent obstacles to preventative action noted above, however, and are practically difficult to maintain given U.S. political and bureaucratic timelines. Further, structural prevention typically demands transformative change in a country’s governance, economy, and social structures. U.S. failures in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past two decades have demonstrated that the United States cannot independently transform other countries, no matter how much time and effort it invests. Medium- to long-term prevention efforts are important, but they should only be part of a prevention initiative and restricted to countries where strong local leadership—including within the host-country government—already exists that U.S. efforts can reinforce.
Instead, “just-in-time” prevention efforts should serve as the initiative’s most targeted and visible element, the tip of the prevention pyramid. Just-in-time prevention efforts seek to change conflict actors’ behavior once a situation has already begun to escalate, what experts call operational prevention, using incentives, consequences, mediation, or even the threat of force. Such nearer-term efforts will have a more acute national security imperative and—if grounded in realistic, specific objectives—are more likely to demonstrate results in the near term, helping build policymaker buy-in. Research has also underscored operational prevention’s effectiveness.
Just-in-time and longer-term prevention efforts in select countries should be complemented by systemic bureaucratic reforms that mitigate impediments to preventative action—such as a highly restrictive diplomatic security posture and poor staffing structures in conflict-prone countries—and strengthen praxis around conflict prevention. These reforms could build on the State Department modernization agenda and should serve as the base of the prevention pyramid, establishing a stronger foundation for preventative action.
3) Prioritize operational resources
Operational resources, particularly funding and authorities to quickly hire skilled staff, are the most important resource for crafting more adaptive, responsive U.S. policymaking processes. They also effectively incentivize bureaucratic support for the initiative, recognizing that qualified staff are one of the scarcest resources of the offices overseeing U.S. policy in conflict-affected countries. None of the initiatives I examined provide significant, dedicated operational resources, however. The GFA and MEPI instead surge foreign aid funding. While often a useful tool, no foreign aid project in isolation can prevent war; as illustrated in the Yemen case study, U.S. influence instead depends on major policy decisions at key moments, such as in Yemen during 2011, 2014, and 2015, and the degree to which policymaking processes are sufficiently responsive and adaptive during those moments. Surging aid without operational resources can fuel the problematic tendency to projectize prevention efforts.
Dedicated operational funding combined with temporary hiring authorities1 should be used to strengthen existing structures like the State Department’s desks and embassies, with an emphasis on quality over quantity. Doing so requires a fraction of the funding needed to launch new foreign assistance programs and, in some cases, may be cost neutral. This could include hiring country experts from outside of government, surging support from conflict experts within the U.S. government, and regularizing and incentivizing interagency detail assignments to create a taskforce-like structure capable of tightening the alignment of military, diplomatic, economic, and intelligence tools. When a country is graduated from the initiative, these staff should be disbanded to avoid the proliferation of irrelevant and inefficient legacy systems. Strong congressional support is essential to enabling operational resources and sustaining a conflict prevention initiative across changes in administration, as seen with both the GFA and atrocity prevention process."
28,Comments on “Lessons from history for successful disinflation” by Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/comments-on-lessons-from-history-for-successful-disinflation/,Donald Kohn,"July 25, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"The Romers have written another fascinating narrative exploring the connection of monetary policy decision making and economic outcomes—in this case, the policy attitudes and approaches that led to substantial and long-lasting reductions in high inflation. The subject is of particular interest right now, of course, because the Federal Reserve is in the midst of an attempt to lower inflation from several decade highs after the COVID pandemic to its announced target of 2 percent.
Their conclusions, drawn from analysis of policy deliberations and policymakers’ public statements, seem obvious once you see them—but weren’t so clear and backed by evidence before the authors’ extensive examination. Successful disinflations, aside from those reflecting price controls or favorable supply shocks, require sustained commitment from the central bank. That commitment has encompassed a clear eye on the goal of price stability, including in some cases a numerical target; acceptance of responsibility for achieving price stability, encouraging but not relying on the policy actions of others to help achieve the goal; and a willingness to impose short-term pain in lost output to achieve the long-run gains associated with price stability.
They reinforce these conclusions by examining episodes of deliberate disinflations where one or more of these criteria for commitment were not met and restrictive policy was ended prematurely; they classify these as medium- and low-commitment disinflations. In those cases, policymakers were unwilling to accept the responsibility or unwilling to force the output losses required for complete success. In low commitment cases inflation may have flattened out after rising, but it did not fall much if at all from high levels; medium-commitment disinflations were marked by some, but incomplete disinflations. And they run statistical tests to show that their classifications of commitment are indeed correlated with the degree of disinflationary success.
In my comments I will extend their analysis to the 1982-1995 period when the disinflation begun in 1979 and 1981 was completed. Over this span, core PCE inflation fell from around 6 percent in the second half of 1982 to 2 percent in 1996, and the economy enjoyed what has been dubbed “the great moderation” of low inflation and damped business cycles—there was only one modest recession.1 The period was marked by several episodes in which policymakers did not push restrictive policy all the way to price stability. In the fall of 1982, the Federal Reserve backed off the “highly committed” disinflationary push identified by the authors for 1981 even as inflation remained around 6 percent; in 1984, 1988, and 1994 they tightened to stop inflation from rising, but did not hold on in order to hit an implied target. (The authors characterize the 1988 episode as “moderately committed,” and don’t address the others.) Yet policy succeeded in achieving price stability over this period, while minimizing deviations from full employment. I believe an examination of these episodes reveals policymakers engaged in a careful, nuanced weighing of the costs and benefits of pushing to price stability that may not fit easily within the authors’ criteria for successful disinflation.
The fall of 1982: backing off. In October 1979, the Federal Reserve recognized that it needed to make a dramatic shift in its approach to policy if it were to be effective in reducing inflation, which had climbed to around 7-1/2 percent over the summer. It abandoned the incremental changes to its interest rate target in favor of focusing on reserve provision tied to the growth of transactions money, M1. That shift resulted in federal funds rates rising from 11 percent in September 1979 to nearly 18 percent by March and April 1980. But rates subsequently fell sharply, partly responding under the new operating procedures to weak M1 and demand resulting from a Carter administration attempt at credit controls in early 1980. As controls were relaxed, the economy and inflation rebounded, the Committee recognized it had backed off too soon, and in 1981 it redoubled its commitment to reducing inflation through restrained growth in the monetary aggregates.
By the middle of 1982, core inflation had fallen from over 9 percent in early 1981 to around 6 percent, with an unemployment rate of nearly 10 percent and a funds rate of 13 percent. In its deliberations, the FOMC began to focus on a need to lower rates as inflation came down and the economy remained weak.2 M1 growth slowed over the summer, pulling the funds rate down into the 9 percent range under the reserve-focused procedures, but rates then rose in September as M1 accelerated, partly responding to increased demands for precautionary balances amid heightened financial and economic uncertainty. Chairman Paul Volcker viewed rising rates as not appropriate under the circumstances and convened a conference call of the FOMC during which he declared that he “would not find a mechanical application of the reserve provision rules suitable.” 3
The discussion at the October 5 FOMC meeting centered on domestic and global economic weakness and its feedback on confidence in U.S. banks. The unemployment rate was creeping up to over 10 percent and the expected recovery was not yet evident; disarray was developing in financial markets. Inflation had come down and sharp declines in bond yields over the summer indicated that attitudes and expectations about inflation had shifted markedly in a constructive direction. Committee members expressed strong aversion to rising interest rates under these conditions. “This was not a time for business as usual.” Comparisons were made to 1929 (and 1931) when the Federal Reserve had not responded adequately to the growing financial and economic emergency. In addition, deregulation of deposit interest rates under a new Congressional mandate, along with the maturation of an earlier tranche of time deposits issued under a temporary lifting of deposit rate ceilings, promised to enhance the demand for the very liquid transaction deposits in M1, further distorting that aggregate’s relationship to economic activity. 4
It was this latter development that Chairman Volcker emphasized in a speech and press conference later in October in which he announced that the FOMC would no longer be tying reserve provision and money market conditions to movements in M1. But, as evident in the discussion at the October FOMC meeting, backing off even while inflation was still unacceptably elevated reflected a more complete weighing of costs and benefits. With unemployment likely to remain high, inflation was expected to recede further now that attitudes had changed; problems in the oil patch (the failure of Penn Square Bank) and in Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina threatened large U.S. banks that had made considerable loans and investments there. Sustained high interest rates put financial and economic stability at risk. In his speech and press conference, Chairman Volcker emphasized that the FOMC remained committed to bringing inflation down further, but over time.
Summer 1984: tapping the brakes. The economy was growing robustly in the first part of 1984. The unemployment rate was at 8 percent and falling, inflation had decreased to around 4 percent but was rising, and the funds rate was in the neighborhood of 9-1/2 percent. At the same time, the financial system was again under considerable stress. In May, Continental Illinois Bank experienced a run as depositors took stock of the volume of bad petroleum-related loans the bank had purchased from Penn Square bank. Continental was stabilized in a controlled failure by the regulators, but its problems raised questions about other banks that might be similarly situated. At the same time, problems in developing countries, especially in Latin America, deepened and fed back on large U.S. banks. Through this period, policymakers were balancing the need to keep policy tight to slow growth to a more sustainable pace with concerns about the fragility of the financial system—sometimes characterized as on a knife’s edge.5
Under Federal Reserve operating procedures at the time, the FOMC instructed the New York Fed to maintain a level of bank borrowing from the discount window as a proxy for the federal funds rate. That rate had drifted up to around 10-1/4 percent by May. After Continental Illinois failed, banks reduced their demand for discount window loans at every funds rate out of concern about the vulnerability that might be conveyed by such borrowing. The backward shift in the borrowing function raised the funds rate at the FOMC’s specified borrowing target to about 11-1/2 percent by July, where it remained over the balance of the summer.
Of course, the reserve targeting procedures could have been overridden, as they had been in 1982. But they weren’t and, in my view, the tightening of financial conditions even as financial stability was under threat was critical for assuring the continuation of the disinflationary path and reinforcing its credibility. The growth of real GDP moderated from 7-1/2 percent (SAAR) in H1 to 3-1/2 percent in H2, and the rise in inflation was choked off as core PCE inflation slowed from over 4-1/4 percent in the first half to just under 4 percent in the second half of the year. With the economy growing strongly and the unemployment rate down considerably, the FOMC could weigh the costs and benefits of tightening in the face of financial vulnerabilities much differently than they did in the fall of 1982.
1988: limiting an upsurge. When Alan Greenspan took office in August 1987, inflation was 3-1/2 percent, but rising—it had been 2-3/4 percent in the first quarter of the year. The funds rate was also increasing—from 6-1/4 in the first quarter to 6-3/4 in August. Greenspan was determined to consolidate and extend the gains against inflation made under Volcker. He defined price stability as inflation so low it didn’t figure in the decision making of households and businesses, and he, along with the rest of the FOMC, recognized that it wasn’t there yet.
Thus, the tightening continued, and the funds rate reached around 7-1/4 percent in September and October. On October 19, however, stock prices plummeted, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 22.6 percent in one day. The Federal Reserve responded with a promise to meet demands for liquidity and with some easing in the stance of policy, given the expected negative shock to demand from the destruction of wealth. Easing continued into early 1987, with the federal funds rate falling to around 6-1/2 percent in February.
By spring 1988, however, it had become clear that activity had considerable momentum in an economy already producing around estimates of full employment; policy needed to be tightened to head off a further acceleration of inflation, which had already picked up to a bit over 4 percent. Policy continued to be firmed into the spring of 1989, when the federal funds rate reached nearly 10 percent. Indicators available at that time suggested that economic growth was slowing and wage pressures were abating in response to earlier tightening. The FOMC eased policy slightly in a conference call at the beginning of June and followed that up with more easing at its early July meeting. By the end of the year, the funds rate was down to around 8-1/2 percent.
The authors cover this episode and characterize it as “medium commitment” in that the FOMC did not hold on to the tighter policy long enough to make inflation fall substantially; it did decline, but not until several years later. Part of the reason for easing off was a forecast that inflation would indeed move lower in coming years as the economy slowed; but, in addition, the Committee was not seeking an immediate and substantial decrease in price pressures. Rather, as Chairman Greenspan emphasized in his July 1989 Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, the FOMC was facing “a difficult balancing act”—the soft landing of continued growth but declining inflation because growth would be below potential. “We…recognize, however, that a degree of slack in labor and product markets will ease the inflationary pressures that have built up. So our policy, under current circumstances, is not oriented toward avoiding a slowdown in demand, for a slowing from the unsustainable rates of 1987 and 1988 is probably unavoidable. Rather what we seek to avoid is an unnecessary and destructive recession. The balance that we must strike is to support moderate growth of demand in the near term, while concurrently progressing toward our longer-run goal of a stable price level.”6 With inflation down to 4 percent, slow progress toward price stability was expected and acceptable, but rising inflation was inconsistent with achieving that goal and was not acceptable and had to be resisted.7
1994: pre-empting a rise in inflation and engineering a soft landing. In fact, growth did slow some in the second half of 1989 and first half of 1990. When Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 resulted in a sharp spike in oil prices and a hit to household and business confidence, the economy entered a recession, albeit one that turned out to be short (8 months) and mild (the unemployment rate rose from 5.5 to 6.8 over the recession). But the recovery was slow, the jobless rate continued to rise, and inflation fell further. Under the circumstances, the Federal Reserve took the unusual step of continuing to ease policy in the expansion. The federal funds rate was over 6 percent as the expansion began; one year later it was 4 percent and less than a year after that it had fallen to 3 percent, where it remained through 1993.
However, the economy grew very rapidly in late 1993, encouraged by the impetus from very accommodative monetary policy once borrower and lender balance sheets had been repaired from the effects of a real estate bust, and by greatly diminished margins of slack. Although inflation had not picked up—core PCE was at 2.5 per cent over the 12 months ending in December 1993—the FOMC saw the very accommodative stance of policy, characterized by a real funds rate around zero, as inconsistent with preventing an intensification of price pressures going forward given the momentum behind growth. At its February meeting it raised its target for the federal funds rate. The Committee saw some urgency to getting to a more neutral stance of policy, and rates rose steadily over the next year. By February 1995, the funds rate was at 6 percent, but inflation hadn’t increased, and the unemployment rate had fallen to around 5-1/2 percent.
The FOMC tightened policy slightly further in February, but the information coming in after that suggested that economic growth was slackening, reducing the risk of inflation intensifying, and policy went on hold for several months. By early July signs of softening in growth were accumulating, core PCE inflation had leveled out a little over 2 percent, and many members of the FOMC were predicting that inflation would fall further as below-trend growth opened up slack in labor and product markets. With the real funds rate seen as in at least slightly restrictive territory, the FOMC eased policy to avoid an unnecessary weakening in the economy.8
Although inflation had fallen to just over 2 percent on core PCE, many members did not consider this “price stability,” and the discussion at the July meeting and elsewhere acknowledged that further declines in inflation would be required to achieve that goal. This was a period in which several FOMC members backed a strategy called “opportunistic disinflation.” Under this strategy, once inflation had fallen to a fairly low level, the FOMC would not try to engineer economic slack to bring it all the way down, but would resist any increases and take advantage of favorable supply shocks or negative demand shocks that inadvertently opened up output gaps to get all the way to stability.9 Thus 1994-5 is another example, along with 1982, 1984, and 1988-89, of policymakers backing off disinflationary policy before they saw the way clear to price stability.10 By the late1990s core PCE inflation had fallen to just over one percent, with a helpful push from a favorable increase in productivity growth that damped labor costs.
Reflections. Arguably, the period of 1982 to the late 1990s is among the most successful of Federal Reserve monetary policymaking. Inflation fell from 6 percent to levels consistent with price stability, and that was accomplished with only one brief recession that importantly reflected elements outside of Federal Reserve causation or control. Yet this occurred while policymakers demonstrated only medium commitment to disinflation under the authors’ definition, as in the episodes just discussed, policy backed off from its restrictive stance before full price stability was clearly in sight; policymakers were unwilling to do “whatever it takes”.
The cost-benefit calculus behind imposing appreciable costs in lost output shifted once inflation had come off the very high rates of the 1970s and agents’ expectations and actions began to adjust to and anticipate lower rates. The Federal Reserve was not an “inflation nutter” ignoring output costs to achieve price stability; it was, in effect, a flexible inflation targeter, and the maximum employment leg of the dual mandate mattered. As inflation and its expectations declined, the FOMC saw itself as promoting public welfare by focusing more on keeping the economy near full employment—this was the logic behind opportunistic disinflation—provided inflation did not re-accelerate.
Several key characteristics of policymaking through this period contributed to its success. Critically, policymakers remained committed to reaching price stability over time. Monetary policy testimonies of Chairman Greenspan in the late 1980s and early 1990s regularly emphasized the importance of keeping inflation on a downward track. By eliminating the distortions of inflation, promoting price stability was how the Federal Reserve could best contribute to maximum employment and output for the US economy.11 And policymakers recognized that any output loss associated with getting to the price stability goal would be reduced by achieving public credibility for their intentions. Policy deliberations included frequent references to and concerns about inflation expectations, inferred in part from the movement of long-term interest rates. Chairman Greenspan’s February 1993 monetary policy testimony featured an extended discussion of the interactions among long-term rates, inflation expectations, and Federal Reserve credibility, pushing back against arguments that the FOMC should have eased more aggressively in 1992.12
Another important characteristic of policy was that it was forward looking, based on forecasts, however uncertain and subject to error they might have been. The FOMC tightened in anticipation of inflation picking up, leaning against building pressures in labor and product markets. Pre-emptive strategy was especially important to establish credibility for the Federal Reserve’s pursuit of its price stability objective after the high-inflation and premature policy reversals of the 1970s.
2021-24. The authors compare the recent words and actions of the Federal Reserve to the criteria they have identified for successful disinflations to judge the commitment of current policymakers to restoring price stability following the post-covid inflation. They find several reasons to be hopeful in this regard: There’s a strong commitment to the 2 percent target; policymakers are accepting responsibility for hitting the target; and they have evinced willingness to accept some weakness in labor markets to achieve it. Although the story isn’t over yet—as they write, inflation has come down a lot, but remains above target—they are optimistic about eventual success. I agree. The nearly unprecedented pace of policy tightening in 2022 and 2023 demonstrated the Fed’s commitment and backs the authors’ judgment.
The Federal Reserve, however, does have an opportunity to strengthen its commitment to price stability even further and the public’s understanding of it. The Fed is undertaking a five-year review of its “monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication” in 2024-25. This follows a review and adjustment of strategy in 2019-20 that aimed at adapting policy to the low-inflation, low-interest rate environment of 2009-19. This new strategy and its implementation took risks on the side of higher inflation, in part to offset the threat of policy rates being constrained by the effective lower bound on interest rates; arguably, this asymmetry contributed to a delayed response to the inflation surge of 2021-22.13
Several possible elements of the review would be key to capitalizing on the opportunity to bolster the price-stability commitment. It should:
Start with lessons learned from the past five years; what went right, what went wrong, and why.
Fully justify the chosen inflation target. In 2019, the Federal Reserve simply declared it wouldn’t change from the existing two percent target. Two may be the right number, but other targets have been suggested and commitment and understanding would be helped by explaining why a particular target had been chosen.
Define maximum employment as the highest level of employment consistent with price stability. That would assure that the two sides of the dual mandate were consistent.
Make sure the new framework is robust to a wide variety of economic circumstances. The framework should be able to address the low-rates, low-inflation situation of the 20 teens, but also other, more inflationary episodes.
Re-examine the asymmetric approach to labor market tightness embodied in the 2020 framework. In that framework policy takes account of shortfalls from maximum employment, but not actual or projected overshoots. However, judgments about emerging labor market pressures were critical to the successful pre-emptive tightenings of 1984, 1988, and 1994 that we have been discussing. The Federal Reserve should take a particularly hard look at the costs and benefits of retaining the labor market asymmetries in the 2020 framework."

30,Forecasting China’s strategy in the Middle East over the next four years,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/forecasting-chinas-strategy-in-the-middle-east-over-the-next-four-years/,Yun Sun,"December 19, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"In the past two decades, China has rapidly emerged as an increasingly consequential economic, political, and security actor in the Middle East. China is the largest consumer of Middle Eastern oil, Chinese trade with the region has more than tripled over the past 20 years, and China is playing an expanding role in regional peace, security, and diplomacy. Beijing’s strategy in the Middle East has emphasized a comprehensive plan to expand its influence in almost all key domains. The next four years will be essential to China’s acceleration of its political, economic, and diplomatic engagement in the Middle East, with a strong focus on diversifying economic ties, involvement in peace and mediation, and managing a regional power equilibrium that has shifted as the result of the war in Gaza.
Continued dependence on Middle Eastern oil
When China assesses the Middle East in its global strategy, its foremost national interest always lies in energy security. As China is heavily dependent on energy imports, the Middle East is an inevitable and indispensable partner for China. In 2022, about 53% of China’s crude oil imports came from the Middle East. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, China’s crude oil imports hit a record high of 11.3 million barrels per day in 2023, growing by 10% compared to the previous year. Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, and Iran (through Malaysia), occupy top positions in China’s energy import portfolio.
To ensure its energy security, China has worked carefully to avoid overdependence on a single country. According to conversations I had with Chinese experts in October 2024, the Chinese foreign policy community’s conventional wisdom is that China should not import more than 20% of its crude oil from any single country, regardless of whether it is Russia or Saudi Arabia. However, the deliberate avoidance of dependence on a single country does not remove China’s dependence on the Middle East as a region.
Despite China’s commitment to carbon neutrality and a green transition, the diversification of China’s energy portfolio is unlikely to affect China’s dependence on Middle Eastern oil for the next four years. China intends to peak carbon emissions by 2030, which means that it will still be expanding its carbon emissions in 2029. As China prioritizes reducing coal in its overall energy consumption, oil and gas are seen as “cleaner” alternatives. In other words, even if China intends to reduce carbon emissions, coal, rather than oil and gas, is the priority for reductions. This is why the percentage of coal in China’s overall energy consumption decreased from 68.5% to 55.3% from 2012 to 2021, while the percentage of oil increased from 17% to 18%.
China’s dependence on Middle Eastern hydrocarbons has two immediate implications: first, China has to protect stable energy production in the region, and second, China has to protect the safe transportation of energy from the region to China. These two priorities ensure that any conflict that affects or disrupts the production or transportation of China’s oil shipments will not be in China’s national interest. China’s strategy in the Middle East during the incoming Trump administration will be heavily vested in the maintenance of oil production and shipment.
Diversifying economic engagement
The final impact of the war in Gaza on the region’s future is unknown, but several trajectories of China’s strategy in the Middle East will accelerate regardless. First, China’s expansion and diversification of economic ties in the region will deepen in non-energy sectors. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that China’s economic relations with the Middle East completely hinge upon the energy trade, China’s exports to the region reached nearly $229 billion in 2022, while imports exceeded $278 billion. The top commodity China exports to the region is machinery and parts, while its imports primarily consist of natural resources. This signifies that the Middle East has become an important market for China, and that China will look to have the region absorb Chinese overcapacity by increasing its exports.
In addition, China is diving into the development of infrastructure, new and clean energy, the digital economy, and artificial intelligence (AI) in the Middle East while aligning China’s own strategies such as the Belt and Road Initiative with local Middle Eastern blueprints like Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030. In the next four years, China will further saturate the Middle East with its economic presence, including not only trade in goods but also in services. In recent years, Chinese AI companies have been actively building partnerships to expand their market access in the Middle East. Digital technology cooperation between China and regional countries is likely to be the most impactful.
Trajectory of relations with key countries
The Gaza crisis has put China’s traditional balancing diplomacy in the region to a serious stress test. Until 2023, China had been able to maintain relationships with all parties in the region, between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and between the Arab world and Israel relatively well. This strategic flexibility was made possible by China’s relatively detached position and lack of entanglement with regional powers. However, the Gaza crisis has demonstrated the limitation of China’s balancing diplomacy. With the shifts and uncertainty associated with the regional power equilibrium, China’s balancing diplomacy will have to adapt.
First, many in China see the Gaza crisis as a temporary setback for the reconciliation process between Israel and the Arab countries, and that eventually, normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia will occur. China does not necessarily see itself as a benefactor of such normalization because a security pact between the United States and Saudi Arabia, a precondition for Israel-Saudi normalization, will undermine China’s efforts to shape a new regional security architecture with less U.S. involvement and influence. China does not yet have critical influence over Saudi Arabia’s strategic alignment choice. Nevertheless, China is likely to use its energy, economic, and political engagement to neutralize the impact of the Saudi-U.S. defense agreement, particularly if such a pact includes clauses that hinder security and technological cooperation between China and Saudi Arabia. It means China will prioritize building leverage and enhancing ties with Saudi Arabia (as well as other key Arab states) to balance their deepened security ties with the United States. China has been pushing against a U.S.-led regional security organization or mechanism—what the Chinese have termed a “Middle Eastern NATO.” Although China’s nascent and superficial security involvement in the region means that this process is occurring largely independently from China, it does not stop China from working to influence it.
Similarly, it will be important for China to support Iran’s efforts to regain its strength and prestige after the latter has taken a heavy toll from Israel’s attacks on its regional proxies, including Hamas and Hezbollah. China would like to see a regional security architecture anchored on a balance of power, with Iran as a strong pillar and as China’s partner in countering U.S. dominance in the region’s security affairs. Thus, Iran’s weakening is not conducive to this approach. China signed a 25-year blueprint on economic engagement with Iran in 2021, but the progress in investment and economic cooperation has been lacking.
Moving forward, China may prioritize rebuilding Tehran’s strength to preserve the region’s balance of power. That could entail more imports of Iranian crude oil, more investment in Iran’s infrastructure, and support for Iran’s regional approach. China remains concerned about the threat of U.S. sanctions, but such support from Beijing could transpire in a relatively less political manner such as through illicit trade, development aid, and diplomatic support. Beijing denies the existence of an “axis of evil” with Russia, North Korea, and Iran, but privately, Chinese officials recognize that these countries share more convictions and interests in international politics with China than China does with the United States. This sentiment could potentially heighten if U.S.-China relations enter another “freefall” under the second Trump administration. In all, China will not let Tehran fail, particularly because Beijing’s relationship with Tehran would presumably help balance Saudi Arabia’s pursuit of relationships with the United States and Israel.
Navigating a difficult relationship with Israel
China’s relationship with Israel suffered the most from the war in Gaza. China has refused to define Hamas as a terrorist organization and has been almost unequivocally critical of Israel and the “humanitarian disaster” it created in Gaza since the beginning of the crisis. The key caveat is not that China adopted a pro-Palestine position, but rather that China adopted an anti-U.S. position in the Gaza crisis. Because Beijing sees Israel as America’s closest ally in the region, China’s default position is to counter the positions of the United States and its allies. Had Israel’s alliance with the United States not been a factor, China’s position toward the Gaza crisis would likely have followed Beijing’s traditional balancing act. In the Chinese policy community, it is widely acknowledged that Israel is the “victim” of U.S.-China great power competition coming to China’s policy toward the war in Gaza.
The challenge is how Beijing will manage its relationship with Israel beyond the Gaza crisis. Some in Beijing are seriously concerned about some Israeli voices who call for Israel to develop relations with Taiwan as retaliation against China’s pro-Palestine position. An Israeli parliamentary delegation visited Taiwan in April 2024, and Taiwan’s possible role in Israel’s pager attacks against Hezbollah has brought keen attention to the previously quiet military relations between Israel and Taiwan. Few in China actually believe that Israel will pursue diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but the evolving relationship evidently has ramifications for China and its top priority of the “One China” principle.
The trajectory of the China-Israel relationship in the next four years will be a key question for China’s Middle East strategy. China does not have a fundamental conflict of national interests with Israel, and their deteriorating relations today are a consequence of the Israel-Palestine conflict rather than a direct clash between China and Israel. Therefore, given China’s tradition of balancing diplomacy in the Middle East, China will foreseeably want to repair damaged ties with Israel through a diverse range of engagements. This will be particularly true and occur expediently if the Gaza crisis ends and if some level of reconciliation is achieved between Israel and Saudi Arabia.
But there are also counterfactors. The Gaza war has disillusioned Israelis who previously romanticized their country’s relationship with China, as Israel had hoped for China to adopt a more sympathetic and supportive attitude toward Israel’s position. A sense of betrayal, a resentment of China’s position, and emotional reactions to China’s repeated criticisms will make it exceedingly difficult to convince the Israeli people that China is neutral and trustworthy again. Pragmatism might prevail in the end, but it could take more than four years for things to renormalize.
Growing involvement in regional peace and conflict mediation
President Xi Jinping first proposed the concept of a new “common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security” architecture in the Middle East in 2018 during the 8th China-Arab States Cooperation Forum. In 2022, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi built upon Xi’s proposal further by calling for a “new security architecture in the Middle East.” In addition to tendering positions based on principles such as adherence to political and diplomatic dialogues, the centrality of regional countries, and the sacredness of the U.N. Charter, Wang offered two specific overtures on regional peace dialogues: first, an international peace conference on the settlement of Palestine based on a two-state solution; and second, a Gulf security dialogue platform to address the tension between Iran and Arab countries. Based on these visions, China’s goal is not to replace the United States as the security guarantor in the region. Instead, China is trying to displace the United States’ regional dominance by facilitating the creation of a new security structure in the Middle East; a structure in which China could play a more significant role given its growing economic weight and political ties with various powers in the region.
China has had two successes on Middle East peace and conflict issues since its new vision was introduced. In March 2023, Saudi Arabia and Iran reached a peace deal in Beijing that was nominally “brokered” by China. The exact role China played in the deal is a subject of heavy debate, focusing on whether China only facilitated the dialogue or indeed substantively mediated. Still, it was China’s first major success in mediating an international conflict. China’s second success came in July 2024, when 14 different Palestinian factions signed the Beijing Declaration on Ending Division and Strengthening Palestinian National Unity in Beijing. Doubts are rampant over the deal’s practicality and implementation, but the fact that China chaired the process at the minimum demonstrates its growing influence on the issue.
With its newly minted stature as the regional peacemaker, China will undoubtedly enhance its involvement in Middle East peace affairs over the next four years. Chinese diplomats and Middle East scholars appear ready, having been mobilized to contribute ideas and plans toward this end. Beijing foreseeably will be using its diplomatic influence and many channels of communication to assert its role and involvement.
However, it will not be easy for China to mediate on the Israeli-Palestinian issue. Beijing’s striking inability to make any difference in the Gaza war signifies China’s weakness as a peace broker. In fact, the moment that China picked a side by refusing to denounce Hamas’ Oct 7 attack, it lost its impartiality and credibility as a mediator. This dictates that China must increase its relationship-building and influence over the Palestinian movement’s internal dynamics to build up the movement’s strength and enhance Beijing’s ability to mediate the conflict. The post-conflict reconstruction in Gaza, Lebanon, and other conflict-torn areas will offer China a good opportunity to attain such influence, as China specializes in infrastructure construction and has financial resources to support it.
China may also increase its efforts to mediate between Iran and other Gulf countries in the Middle East. Iran’s leadership in the region’s “axis of resistance” has been In the Chinese assessment, Iran’s response through mid-October 2024 has been largely moderate and tailored, which could suggest that Tehran has a bigger appetite for more conciliatory moves vis-à-vis Saudi Arabia, among others. China’s relationship with Iran will foreseeably gain more momentum, as China will want to see the restoration of some type of regional power equilibrium. Enhanced ties with both Iran and the Arab states will offer China an avenue for more influence in political dialogues.
China’s military presence in the Middle East?
The long-standing suspicion that China will sooner or later seek a military presence in the Middle East to protect its energy interests is unlikely to be resolved by 2029. China’s prioritized theater continues to be the Western Pacific and will remain so as long as the Taiwan issue is not resolved. This means that China will have to live with the insecurity of its energy dependence on the Middle East in the meantime. Chinese oil executives have made a distinction between susceptibility and vulnerability, arguing that China’s oil dependence on the Middle East is susceptible but not vulnerable to the volatile regional security situation. The confidence comes from a judgment that no one, the United States and oil-producing countries included, will want to see a major disruption in the global market.
The argument made by Chinese oil executives consciously does not consider extreme situations such as a U.S.-China military conflict and a naval blockade of China’s oil shipments from the Middle East. Beijing does not seem to see a practical solution to that vulnerability. Furthermore, building up China’s regional military presence from scratch is unlikely to protect China’s oil interests for a very long time to come given the U.S. military’s mature and significant presence in the region.
However, this does not mean that China will be absent from developing closer security ties with countries in the region to enhance its influence even short of a direct military presence and deployment. China currently has a number of security cooperation arrangements in the region, including joint exercises and drone production cooperation with Iran, joint training and arms sales to the United Arab Emirates, as well as potentially dual-use port facilities. In this sense, it is unlikely that China will establish a direct military presence in the Middle East in the next four years, even though Beijing’s regional security cooperation and influence will expand through bilateral cooperation, arms sales, and dual-use facilities.
Conclusion
The challenge from China’s strategy and presence in the Middle East will only continue to grow during the Trump administration. By 2029, the region will remain a cornerstone of China’s energy security, which makes it imperative for Beijing to increase its role, presence, and influence in the region to protect its critical national interest. China will continue diversifying its economic ties with the region, going beyond the traditional field of energy by venturing into the energy transition and the digital economy and looking for buyers of advanced technology exports.
As a result of the war in Gaza, China’s relations with key countries in the region will foreseeably go through a period of adjustment. This is particularly true of Israel, as the China-Israel relationship has suffered the most damage due to the Gaza crisis. Following its mantra of having balanced diplomacy, China will be keen to build deeper relationships with both Iran and Saudi Arabia and could contribute toward building up Iran’s capability and restoring Tehran’s tarnished image in the region. China sees itself as a new type of regional peacemaker and likely intends to play a bigger role in the mediation among different Palestinian factions and Gaza’s reconstruction. The “new security architecture in the Middle East” proposal will be a more prominent feature in China’s policy toward the region between 2025 and 2029.
All these have significant implications for the incoming Trump administration. As President-elect Donald Trump is expected to support Israel’s security, push for Saudi-Israel normalization, and pressure Iran with more sanctions, China will be actively working to exploit U.S. policy and advance Chinese interests and influence in the region. The Gaza crisis has been a strong example of how China has leveraged Washington’s position to undermine U.S. regional leadership and credibility. Washington can rest assured that China stands ready to continue to do so for the next four years. This means the Trump administration’s Middle East policy will have to include an answer, or even just propose a future direction, for the inevitable question of Palestine’s status and the issue of the two-state solution. The absence of it will only strengthen China’s ability to act as a supporter and advocate for the Palestinian people, thereby reinforcing Beijing’s influence and ties with the Muslim world.
China’s growing and diversifying economic ties with the Middle East will directly challenge the United States’ traditional role and leadership. A vigorous economic engagement strategy beyond the issue of oil has always been lacking in the United States’ regional policy playbook. As the region envisions its economic future and plans for the diversification of its economic growth, the United States will miss the train and leave the field for China if it is unable to respond to the region’s demand for high-technology industries and new energy resources. China’s technological cooperation with Middle Eastern countries, especially in the fields of digital economy and infrastructure, will pose an immediate challenge to the United States’ ability to advance security and other cooperation in the region. The Trump administration could work with U.S. private sector companies to present the countries of the Middle East with alternative options to Chinese technologies and products."
31,Hezbollah and the Axis of Resistance in 2024,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/hezbollah-and-the-axis-of-resistance-in-2024/,Bruce Riedel,"January 16, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Hezbollah, the Shia movement created more than forty years ago in Lebanon, is one of the most successful and heavily armed nonstate actors in recent history. With tens of thousands of battle-hardened fighters and backing from Iran, Hezbollah poses a serious threat to Israel. The group has joined the Israel-Hamas war and displaced tens of thousands of Israelis from their homes in the Galilee, in northern Israel. The Houthis, Hezbollah’s ally and understudy in Yemen, have joined the fight and been bombed by the United States and the United Kingdom. There is a growing risk that the conflict will expand further beyond Gaza and the Red Sea into a regional war including Lebanon.
Origins of the “Party of God”
Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982, known as Operation Peace for Galilee, set the stage for Hezbollah’s creation. Intended to destroy the Palestinian resistance movement, Israel’s operation instead bogged the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in a quagmire. Iran and Syria created Hezbollah to fight the IDF and drive out the American and French troops sent to maintain peace and order in Beirut. Iran continues to have significant influence over Hezbollah’s decisionmaking to this day.
In 1982, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps sent a detachment to Lebanon to train Shia fighters and provide expertise in terrorism and guerrilla warfare. They were ruthless: throughout the 1980s, they twice blew up the U.S. Embassy, killed hundreds of Marines and French paratroopers, kidnapped Americans, and murdered CIA station chief William Buckley in Beirut. My friend and mentor Robert Ames was killed in the April 1983 suicide bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut.
Hezbollah also expanded its operations outside of the Middle East. In 1992 and 1994, Hezbollah members were involved in suicide bombings in Argentina targeting the Israeli embassy and a Jewish cultural center. The United States has sanctioned members of Hezbollah involved in the bombings.
The mastermind of Hezbollah’s terrorist activities was Imad Mughniyeh. He plotted the attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and the Marines at Beirut airport as well as the bombings in Buenos Aires. He was killed in Damascus in 2008, reportedly by the Central Intelligence Agency.
Hezbollah also developed and maintains large fundraising operations across the Middle East, Africa, and North and South America, including the tri-border region of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. It is involved in drug trafficking, diamond smuggling, and a variety of legal economies from which it supports its nefarious militant activities.
Hezbollah’s evolution
Over the years, Hezbollah expanded from a terrorist network to a well-organized militia and a political movement that came to dominate Lebanon’s politics. Today, it is the single strongest movement in Lebanon, a remarkable achievement for the long-suppressed and marginalized Shia community. Yet while running an impressive medical support and service distribution machine for its Shia constituents, Hezbollah has acted as a destructive and irresponsible political spoiler at the national level, preventing meaningful accountability and governance progress even as Lebanon remains mired in a catastrophic economic meltdown.
In 2006, Israel and Hezbollah fought an intense war with severe consequences for both Israeli and Lebanese civilians. Over a thousand Lebanese civilians were killed by IDF bombing and 39 Israeli civilians were killed by Hezbollah attacks; a million Lebanese civilians were displaced by the war.
Since then, both sides have been eager to avoid a repetition of full-scale war. There have been frequent firefights along the border, but they have not escalated into a war. In 2022, Lebanon and Israel negotiated a maritime border agreement backed by Hezbollah with U.S. assistance.
In 2011, Hezbollah came to the defense of the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria together with Iran and Russia. The aid helped Assad hold onto power through the Arab Spring and the Syrian civil war.
The war in Gaza
Hezbollah is eager to show solidarity with Sunni Hamas in its war with Israel that began with a devastating Hamas surprise attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Subsequently, incidents in the Israel-Lebanon border region have become more frequent. As a consequence, Israel has evacuated thousands of citizens from the border region, including the city of Kiryat Shmona, which has over 20,000 residents.
Hezbollah’s arsenal of missiles and rockets has grown from 15,000 in 2006 to over 130,000 today. Every city and town in Israel is at risk. Beyond enabling Hezbollah and Iran to meddle in various countries of the Middle East, this arsenal is a means to deter Israel from attacking Iran’s nuclear facilities. A military assault on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure will likely spark a massive attack on Israel by both Iran and Hezbollah. This has effectively deterred Israel even as Tehran has accelerated its nuclear program since the Trump administration withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in 2018.
Chaos in the Red Sea
Today, Hamas and Hezbollah have been joined by the Yemeni Houthis, a Zaydi Shia group, in attacking Israel. The Houthis, Hezbollah, and Hamas all receive financial and materiel support from Iran. Along with pro-Iran Shia militias in Iraq and various actors in Syria, they form Iran’s Axis of Resistance to Israel and the United States. The Houthis have modeled themselves after Hezbollah but had never actually targeted Israel until December 2023, when they launched drones against Israel. Now they are routinely attacking merchant ships in the Red Sea, significantly disrupting shipping at Israeli ports.
The Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea prompted Washington to create a maritime alliance to protect international shipping. On January 11, 2024, the United States and the United Kingdom conducted dozens of military strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. Oman, Yemen’s neighbor, condemned the attacks and Saudi Arabia has urged restraint because it rightly fears that military operations against the Houthis will spark a breakdown in Yemen’s cease-fire and renewed Houthi strikes on the kingdom after a decade of a bloody war.
For the Houthis, these strikes are only a continuation of U.S. support for the Saudi war that has lasted a decade. They are unlikely to be intimidated by air strikes.
Heightened risks of escalation
Israel has declared it will target Hamas leaders outside of Gaza. On January 2, 2024, an Israeli fighter jet killed several senior Hamas leaders in a southern suburb of Beirut which has long been a Hezbollah stronghold. Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah condemned the attack and vowed that there would be a “response and punishment.” The bombing in Iran on January 3 has added to the atmosphere of worsening conflict in the region.
Hezbollah is playing a careful strategy in the Israel-Hamas war: underscoring its support for Hamas and imposing serious costs on Israel while so far avoiding an all-out war with the latter. The carefully calibrated level of violence is inherently difficult to control and could break down at any moment.
The Biden administration has been urging Israel not to attack Hezbollah and provoke a wider war. Its decision to send Lisa Johnson, a new U.S. ambassador with considerable experience in the region, to Beirut is a positive step, but the administration will need to redouble its efforts to avoid escalation. The war in Gaza must end. A sustainable and comprehensive cease-fire in Gaza, which is currently being pursued by U.S. partners, including Egypt and Qatar, is essential to prevent an outbreak of regional conflict from Beirut to Sana’a. The situation is urgent."
32,How will climate cooperation look after the elections?,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-will-climate-cooperation-look-after-the-elections/,David G. Victor,"August 13, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Although there’s been a lot of progress in cutting the emissions that cause climate change, actually stopping and reversing climate change will require a whole lot more. Only by slashing emissions essentially to zero everywhere on the planet will the climate be allowed to heal itself. Achieving those kinds of deep cuts will probably require that countries work together more closely—to figure out who pays the cost of developing new technologies and to manage the effects of expensive emission controls on economic competitiveness.
The logic for deep cooperation is compelling, but that logic is a hard sell in today’s era of intensifying economic nationalism. Many of the world’s largest industrial economies, including the United States and China, see an economic advantage in investing in the technologies of a clean industrial future. What’s good for one country will be seen as a lost advantage for others. Cooperation is particularly hard to forge when that kind of zero-sum logic prevails. Institutions that could help achieve more cooperation, such as the World Trade Organization, are already fraying—not least because U.S. support for rules-based international cooperation has been waning. On top of that, for serious cooperation on climate change to move forward, the least developed countries will require money to help them pay the costs of adjustment to new energy systems as well as deal with the harsh impacts of climate change. Poor countries that didn’t cause global warming and are highly vulnerable to the impacts of a changing climate want compensation. Ponying up those funds is deeply unpopular in Washington and has been for a long time.
The two candidates for U.S. president, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, have espoused radically different approaches to international cooperation. A President Trump would pull out of most international institutions where climate cooperation is discussed, just as he pulled out of the Paris Agreement during his first term in office. A Harris successor to the Biden administration would likely stay inside those institutions and engage. She and her vice-presidential pick, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, have a long track record of supporting national policies that help cut emissions.
In practice, however, these diverging formal strategies may matter a lot less than they appear. The disruptions caused by a Trump electoral victory, and a subsequent U.S. exit from the international climate order, will be tempered. At first blush, it seems like nothing could be more destructive to international cooperation than exiting the Paris Agreement—and possibly also leaving the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a treaty negotiated by a Republican president in the early 1990s with long-standing U.S. support. But having the Trump administration formally on the outside would be less disruptive than if the United States were to adhere to the treaty while the Trump team caused mischief from within. That’s because many other governments around the world (led by much of Europe) along with many states and localities within the United States would react, as they did during the first Trump term, by showing that they are “still in.” Having rehearsed these scenarios already in 2017-2020, the Trump exit will probably happen faster in a second Trump term than during the first, but so will the counter-response from the rest of the world.
A Harris win in November would be less disruptive of the existing order. However, her team can’t erase the problem that global climate cooperation will require a lot more climate finance—including money from governments that the United States won’t supply. These tensions lurked in the background of the last big climate conference last November in Dubai, COP28. And just a week after the U.S. election, the curtain will rise on COP29 in Baku where these conflicts could be even more acute. The United States, under Harris, will do its best to act on climate change, but it will still need to overcome sticky conflicts over climate finance for the world’s poorest countries to advance climate diplomacy in Baku. The last time these roadblocks proved impassible—in 2009 in Copenhagen—climate cooperation went into a deep freeze for several years until new thinking and approaches could resurrect it.
Put bluntly, the next occupant of the White House matters less than the real barrier to international climate progress: money.
Why international cooperation matters
Cooperation matters not just because pollution comes from every nation on the planet and mixes throughout the global atmosphere. Cooperation is also important because cutting those emissions will cost money. As a general rule, when energy costs go up economic competitiveness can be harmed—both in reality and in political perception.
Additionally, creating new zero-pollution industries could re-sort the global economy and great power competition. The clean industries of tomorrow could be big employers and value-creators, which is why many countries—including China, the big European economies, the United States, Japan, and others—are investing heavily. Their goal isn’t just to clean up their economies but also to occupy the commanding heights of the future economy.
Because action on climate change affects competitiveness, cooperation implicates the nuts and bolts of the global economic system, such as the World Trade Organization, investment treaties, and systems for development assistance. Rebuilding the economy to be greener is no less ambitious than transforming much of the whole economy, which is one reason that industrial policy is back in vogue. Given how much is at stake, there are strong incentives for countries to seek self-advantage. Countries, including the United States, are adopting tariffs and blocking cross-border investments so they can be sure that their companies can thrive in future industries. The U.S. approach to China—with high and rising tariffs on many green products—is particularly striking. The green industrial revolution could emerge in ways that promote global trade and engagement or undermine them.
What kinds of international cooperation matter?
The climate problem has been reliably on the international agenda since the late 1980s. During most of that history, “international cooperation” has primarily referred to global cooperation forged by diplomatic agreements negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations. The first big treaty on climate change, the 1992 U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), included nearly every nation on the planet. Every member of that treaty agreed to its content, which is why the agreement’s key provisions are steeped in complicated and convoluted wording—every country could see in the treaty its interpretation of what was agreed. The first protocol to that treaty, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, also had nearly universal participation in the drafting, although the United States and a few other countries never ratified the agreement.
The architects of those global treaties thought they were following the successful model established during the international effort to save the ozone layer. But the two experiences—ozone and climate change—could not be more different in their success. The ozone accords have succeeded because they focused innovation and technological change on solutions to ozone depletion. They created incentives for firms and governments to invest in new technologies along with mechanisms that could figure out which new technologies were most promising.
For a couple of decades, by contrast, most diplomacy on climate change wasn’t focused on innovation and problem solving. Rather, the climate accords were mostly a cauldron of gridlock and inaction. Diplomats were good at going to meetings and crafting vague global agreements, but those agreements had little impact on underlying behavior. Along the way, policymakers learned that there were real trade-offs between global participation and the content of the agreements they could reach. When that content was legally binding, the trade-offs were particularly acute because no nation wanted to sign up for an agreement it couldn’t honor.
By the early 2010s, after more than two decades of diplomacy on climate change, there wasn’t much real action to cut emissions to show for all the diplomacy. A new approach was needed. The 2015 Paris Agreement marked a sharp break. The innovation in Paris was flexibility: the agreement lets countries set their own obligations and then adjust them periodically. Countries willing to do more pledge more. And most countries pledge more than they can deliver, which is tolerable because the pledges aren’t binding—they can be adjusted with experience and learning. Since the adoption of this new approach, careful empirical research has shown that more aggressive pledging has also led to more credible and aggressive national policies. Paris is a global agreement, but it is designed to allow countries to advance their climate policies at different speeds. Because of that design—indeed, because of that political realism—Paris is working and the trajectory of emissions is coming down.
In addition to global cooperation, there are now lots of “smaller” forms of cooperation that involve just a few countries and firms in key sectors or just small clubs of countries that are willing to take action. We used to call these “coalitions of the willing” —although that phrase was poisoned by the second U.S. venture into Iraq, which didn’t go well, and thus the community is still struggling to find the right language. Most of these just get called “climate clubs.”
Since 1995, the climate community has met annually for a global “conference of the parties” (COP) that is the formal meeting of all the countries that have joined the UNFCCC. At COP26 in 2021, interest in climate clubs exploded. Hosted in Glasgow by the British government, COP26 followed a theory of change that relied on doing what was possible through the global U.N. framework and then advancing most of the hard work—such as coordinating and funding new investments in clean steel production, or sales of alternative aviation fuels—in smaller clubs of the willing.
What if Trump wins in November?
If Donald Trump returns to the White House after the November election, then it is clear that one of his first actions will be to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement. Trump has already done that once before and has promised a repeat performance if elected. On top of that, it’s pretty easy to pull out of the treaty, which has not been ratified by the Senate. In tandem, the United States will also probably stop overt funding of climate assistance to other countries, although current U.S. funding of that type is already pretty small. Whether the Trump team would be able to root out all the other ways that U.S.-backed institutions, like the World Bank, direct funding for climate purposes remains to be seen.
Depending on who has the president’s ear—which is hard to pin down at team Trump—his administration might also try to exit the UNFCCC. Legally, that’s a bit harder because the United States joined that treaty through the Senate ratification process and leaving might require new Senate action. (Analysts disagree.)
Most folks steeped in climate diplomacy think it will be a disaster if the United States leaves the Paris Agreement and an even bigger disaster if the country exits the UNFCCC altogether. I’m not so sure. Having the United States formally inside a system that the Trump presidency aims to undermine is probably worse than having the United States leave. Under the George W. Bush administration, when the United States was part of the UNFCCC but refused the joint the Kyoto Protocol, U.S. diplomats caused endless mischief that probably slowed progress (though the U.S. position was sympathetic to many other countries, including Saudi Arabia).
Even if the Trump administration ignores (or tries to undermine) official international cooperation on climate change, most of the clubs will keep clubbing. The United States has been a key architect of those clubs—climate envoy John Kerry’s team pushed, in tandem with COP26, the “first movers coalition” that was basically a coalition of the willing, including the United States. If the U.S. federal government turns hostile to climate cooperation, then lots of other countries—notably led by Europe—will be motivated to do more. Multinational firms and private industry in the United States and abroad are also significantly involved in nearly all these clubs—they are likely to keep working on climate action because they look, typically, beyond the tenure of any president when making long-term investments.
It is harder to pin down what China would do in response to Trump’s reelection and a U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. We might see the emergence of a more active Chinese climate strategy aimed at pushing Chinese products and clean energy investments to other countries. That would yield, in climate, what is already evident in many other areas of international cooperation—competing blocks of power and no central strategy (see here and here). All told, a more active Chinese engagement on climate would probably help improve cooperation—if that engagement included active efforts to keep markets for clean technology products (many exported from China) open for trade.
A Trump administration hostile to climate action will also invigorate some U.S. states—the blue ones—that previously redoubled their climate policy efforts because being anti-Trump on a signature environmental issue was good politics for their democratic bases. State-based action soared, including actions by key states like California—actions that, because such state economies dwarf those of many countries’, were tantamount to a national-level foreign policy on climate change. In 2018, for example, California Governor Jerry Brown hosted a Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco and invited world leaders to talk about cooperation with California since the federal government, under Trump, was not available.
How a Trump victory might affect American credibility
The really big impact of a Trumpian exit from climate cooperation may not be on immediate cooperation. Other countries and states will fill in many, if not all, of the gaps in funding that would be lost. The really big harm will be to U.S. credibility—the feeling that the world can’t rely on the United States to put together and hold together international arrangements for cooperation on important problems like climate change.
When Trump won the U.S. presidential election in 2016, his victory occurred in the middle of COP22, the two-week global climate conference that was hosted in Marrakech, Morocco. The U.S. delegation, which formally worked for President Barack Obama but knew who was coming next, was dispirited and the rest of the world was in shock. This time, the rest of the world, to varying degrees, already expects the outcome. The U.S. election will be November 5 and COP29, held in the oil-rich country of Azerbaijan, will open the next week in Baku. If Trump wins, American diplomats will be walking the halls of COP29 with little to do that other countries will find credible.
How the world might view a Harris victory in November
It is easier to predict what will happen if a Harris administration succeeds the Biden one: Not much will change, formally, and the United States will remain engaged at international institutions focused on climate change.
One immediate expression of this formal commitment to the UNFCCC and to the Paris Agreement will be an update to the United States’ pledge for action under the Paris Agreement—known as a nationally determined contribution (NDC). Every five years, all countries are expected to submit updated NDCs; the next round of updates is expected in early 2025 and will form part of the agenda for COP30, which will be hosted by Brazil.
Biden’s first NDC pledged that the United States would adopt policies to cut emissions by about 50%-52% from 2005 levels by 2030. Actual emission cuts in 2030 will probably be more like 37%, with a lot of uncertainty related to the cost of fossil fuels, the pace of technology, the ease of building clean energy projects, and other factors. A new NDC will look further into the future with newly aggressive goals that, most likely, will be newly implausible. Absent a big win for Democrats and control over both houses of Congress, new legislation on climate change is highly unlikely.
The Biden/Harris administration has done more to advance national climate policy, notably with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), than any prior administration. But the economy doesn’t change quickly, the IRA by itself won’t transform the incentives for clean energy, and it is hard to decarbonize an economy entirely with subsidies and no strong sticks such as carbon taxes and regulations. Supreme Court hostility to agency delegation, such as the recent decision to abandon extensive deference to regulatory agencies when they interpret the meaning and scope of statutes, will also constrain a future Harris administration’s ability to work with existing laws to regulate greenhouse gas pollution. (Most environmentalists see this shift in legal precedent as a disaster for environmental regulation. But on climate change, I am not convinced it will matter much because most of the serious action pushing firms to cut emissions isn’t coming from federal regulatory agencies deep in the weeds of interpreting vague statutory authorities. For an overview, see this.)
The Harris administration’s biggest challenges for international cooperation related to climate change don’t lie with the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. Those are friendly forums that aren’t that demanding. The biggest issues are trade and investment. Many countries, led by China, are upset about U.S. tariffs on imported clean energy products. They can’t really take their grievances to the World Trade Organization (WTO)—because the United States under Trump and Biden has refused to appoint members of the WTO’s Appellate Body that is the final arbiter of trade disputes.
Being tough on trade while subsidizing the production of clean energy products here in the United States and in friendly countries (“friendshoring”) is central to Bidenomics. But the problem with this logic is that we can’t (and shouldn’t) build everything we need here in the United States. And it isn’t clear which countries count as “friends.” You’d think that European nations would be reliable friends, but the IRA and other policies aimed at promoting industrial policy don’t create a special advantage for our friends in Europe. Moreover, lots of projects will create inconvenient politics will abound. Saudi Arabia is looking at a clean energy supply project in Morocco (a country that has a Free Trade Agreement with the United States and is thus a logical “friend” with easy access to the U.S. market) that will generate U.S. political backlash as it becomes visible. Mexico is the place where such investments made with an eye to the U.S. market will become most conflictual because of the politicization of the U.S.-Mexico relationship and the looming renegotiation of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement known as “USMCA.”
What the rest of the world thinks
To some degree, diplomats in other countries know what to expect from the winner of the 2024 presidential election—because they have studied and lived through them already. As a general rule, governments keen to advance cooperation on climate change strongly favor a Harris victory because continuity with Biden means that the United States will reliably stay inside the Paris Agreement and reliably attempt to cooperate with other countries.
But even if Harris wins, the global flavor of international cooperation on climate change faces some big challenges that no U.S. administration is in a position to solve.
A key role for international cooperation lies with helping developing countries—especially the least developed nations that are highly vulnerable to the impacts of a problem that they, mostly, did not cause. Much of the most challenging diplomacy in global climate cooperation deals with mobilizing and spending the money needed to help these nations. Traditionally, most of that help has gone toward cutting emissions. But increasingly, assistance is needed to help build resilience against the physical impacts of climate change. Some countries, like low-lying island nations, may actually get wiped off the map from rising seas and storm surges.
Back in 2009, Western governments, led by the United States, promised to deliver $100 billion per year in new climate-related funding for developing countries. Although it took longer than desired, that goal was finally met last year. In Baku, there will be efforts to update that goal for the future, known in the jargon as the “New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance.” In tandem, a new funding system has been created specifically to help countries that suffer “loss and damage” from climate change—that funding mechanism now exists formally but has almost no actual funding. European and other governments have offered significant funding through these mechanisms, but a similar move is deeply unpopular here in the United States.
Quite apart from whoever wins the U.S. election this November, the COP29 meeting that will begin the week after election day may mark a failure of the COP process—because anger in developing countries at the lack of more funding may boil over. Only once before, in 2009 in Copenhagen, did such a high-profile climate event end in failure—in that case, developing country concerns about lack of funding and voice were central causes. When it boils over this time, the blame may get pinned on the United States as a wealthy nation that has been a stingy funder—and if Trump wins his victory, in particular, he might attract the blame. Blame aside, the real problems are deeply structural—the most vulnerable developing countries are understandably upset that they are suffering the impacts of climate change yet aren’t being helped much by the countries responsible for most of the pollution. No matter who sits in the White House, the political support for a big funding program will be elusive."
33,Extremist Israeli settlers are nonstate armed actors,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/extremist-israeli-settlers-are-nonstate-armed-actors/,Jeffrey Feltman,"January 16, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Given the immense destruction and humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, Israel’s military response to Hamas’ October 7 depraved terrorist attack and war crime abductions dominates current media coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But journalists and others have also documented the precarious situation in the West Bank, where escalating settler violence against Palestinian civilians risks igniting a third Palestinian intifada.
In response, the United States announced visa restrictions against both Israelis and Palestinians undermining peace and stability in the West Bank. Inter alia, this new policy is aimed at ideological, extremist settlers using violence to expel Palestinians from their lands and villages as well as Palestinians attacking settlers and soldiers. In addition, reports indicate that the Biden administration is slow-rolling Israel’s request for 20,000 M16 rifles, seeking assurances that these will not end up in the hands of extremist settlers. These are good steps, but more action is needed.
In the occupied West Bank, settler violence against Palestinian civilians and property (as well as Palestinian attacks on Israeli settlers and soldiers) is not new, as a U.N. interactive website demonstrates. Yet settler violence and threats against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank surged after October 7. Some observers cite entire villages whose Palestinian residents were forced to flee. Olive groves, solar panels, and water infrastructure have been targeted. Livestock driven off or stolen. Palestinians shot in cold blood. In many attacks, Israeli soldiers — likely reservists, including those drawn from the settlements — have watched or participated. The Israeli government rarely prosecutes settlers attacking Palestinians.
The extremist settlers are transparent and ideological in their goals: to drive Palestinians if not entirely out of the West Bank then at least from the 60% of the West Bank classified by the Oslo process as Area C, which is under full Israeli civilian and military control. Whether they justify it on biblical grounds, revenge, or claims for safety in light of the October 7 massacre, their goal is to create a homogenous Israel “from the river to the sea.” This constitutes ethnic cleansing, a crime cited in a recent U.S. designation of a Sudanese paramilitary force.
In refusing building permits and cutting off access to agricultural lands, the Israeli government severely restricts Palestinian economic activity and movement in Area C, which under the 1995 Interim Agreement (“Oslo II”) was intended to be gradually transferred to Palestinian control except for areas to be discussed in final status arrangements (i.e., settlements). From its swearing-in in December 2022, the Netanyahu government has promoted de-facto annexation over Area C, in essence endorsing the goals of vigilante settlers.
Despite admonishments from the Biden administration, there is no sign that the current Israeli cabinet, with ministers such as Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich openly supportive of the extremist settlers’ goals and methods, will rein in, let alone arrest, the extremist settlers who intimidate and attack with impunity. The rule of law, which might protect innocent Palestinians or bring violent settlers to justice, does not apply. Yet as the Netanyahu government at best looks the other way, it is strongly in the U.S. interest that the West Bank does not explode in communal violence alongside a war in Gaza and threats from Hezbollah, Iranian-allied militias in Iraq, and the Houthis in Yemen. It is also against U.S. interests to see Palestinian support for Hamas grow, as surely will happen in reaction to the settler violence in the West Bank and the war in Gaza.
Given the Israeli government’s refusal to act, the United States must.
The Biden administration’s visa restriction policy and delay in transferring rifles are welcome but insufficient. The United States should consider the marauding extremist settlers as nonstate armed actors (NSAA) and draw on a broader set of mechanisms, including the freezing of financial accounts and other sanctions. Since visa restrictions do not affect any Israeli-American dual nationals involved in the violence, the U.S. government could widen the target net and pursue Americans who are implicated in group attacks on Palestinian civilians — in the same way that American citizens who are part of international narcotic or criminal rings are no more immune from punitive measures than foreign nationals in those groups.
The United States could also seize the assets of U.S.-based groups funding extremist settler groups attacking Palestinian civilians, in the same way law enforcement tries to disrupt financial flows from U.S.-based groups supporting violent extremism. The United States could work with like-minded countries, as happens in counterterrorism and preventing violent extremism efforts, to build coalitions with coordinated multinational measures responding to extremist settler violence. European Union countries, struggling with internal political reactions to the Israel-Hamas war, may welcome joining efforts aimed at curbing settler violence. Israeli government officials who aid and abet extremist settler violence would also face repercussions.
While an exact definition of nonstate armed actors is contested, a general understanding would encompass groups that use violence, threats, and intimidation to promote a political, ethnic, or religious agenda that comes at the expense of the peace and stability in the areas where the NSAAs operate. Extremist settler groups would seem to qualify. Like the January 6 insurrectionists in the United States, they are extremist actors, supported by politicians, taking illegal actions to change the agreed political dispensation.
For decades, the United States has encouraged Israel to end settlement expansion and to remove settlement outposts considered illegal even under Israeli law. The U.S. approach, relying more on words than tangible leverage, failed; settlement growth in the West Bank and East Jerusalem has nearly tripled in the 30 years after the Oslo process, from approximately 250,000 settlers in 1993 to around 700,000 today. (Following multiple Israeli smoke-and-mirrors announcements of a settlement freeze meant to placate Washington while allowing construction to continue, frustrated U.S. officials sometimes joked that “settlements, like water, expand when frozen.”)
Cracking down on the violent, extremist settlers will not address the challenge of how to establish a contiguous Palestinian state in an area crisscrossed with settlement roads and infrastructure, where most of the largest settlements are essentially bedroom communities for Jerusalem and Tel Aviv that were built with support from successive Israeli governments on occupied land. Nor will an end to settler violence and settlement expansion miraculously create credible Palestinian governing institutions. However, at the very least, punitive measures against violent settlers should prevent a bad situation from getting worse.
The United States draws on a wide variety of tools and coalitions to fight back against Palestinian terrorism, and now Washington should expand the mechanisms used against extremist, violent Israeli settler groups — especially in the absence of effective action, and in light of possible encouragement, from the Netanyahu government."
34,What next on the war in Ukraine?,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-next-on-the-war-in-ukraine/,"Michael E. O’Hanlon, Alejandra Rocha, Sophie Roehse, Mallika Yadwad","October 22, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Introduction and context
The degree to which Western relations with Russia have fallen apart since the hopeful days of Mikhail Gorbachev and the early post-Cold War period is mind-numbing. A few key milestones and events are worth revisiting briefly to establish context.
At the end of 1991, Ukraine regained its independence as the Soviet Union dissolved. In previous centuries, parts of Ukraine had been ruled or contested by foreigners including Poles, Lithuanians, Ottomans, and, of course, Russians. But the country’s core identity was just as old as Russia’s, despite President Vladimir Putin’s absurd claim in his infamous and foreboding 2021 essay that Ukraine was not a real country.
In 1994, in an effort to persuade Ukraine to return to Russia the nearly 2,000 nuclear warheads it had inherited from the Soviet Union, Washington, London, and Moscow each promised to guarantee Ukraine’s sovereignty and security, in what was known as the Budapest Memorandum. That turned out to be an empty promise. (It was never intended to be a binding pledge or treaty.)
By the year 2000, when Putin came to power in the Kremlin, many Russian nationalists were smarting over the previous year’s Kosovo war, in which NATO airpower defeated a key Russian ally, Serbia. NATO then forced Russia to accept a secondary (but real) role in the NATO peace enforcement mission in Kosovo, further adding to Russian grievances. (NATO and Russia had cooperated more smoothly in Bosnia starting a few years earlier, however.)
But the worst in relations was yet to come. After initially positive interactions between President George W. Bush and Putin, Russia would be further perturbed by America’s withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002; the invasion of Iraq in 2003; American support for “color revolutions” that challenged former Soviet apparatchiks ruling in Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan from 2003 to 2005; the continuing eastward enlargement of NATO, including to the Baltic states in 2004 and a U.S. push in 2008 to put Ukraine and Georgia on an accession path to NATO membership. Then there was the 2011 NATO-led overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya after NATO claimed it would only use force to protect innocents rather than carry out regime change, and American rhetorical support for Putin’s domestic political opponents in the 2012 presidential election.
Unfortunately, Western countries’ efforts to develop positive relations with Russia over the years, such as the creation of the NATO-Russia Council, invitations to Russia to join the Group of Seven and World Trade Organization, summit meetings between Putin and George W. Bush, President Barack Obama’s attempt at a “reset” in U.S.-Russia relations during the Medvedev presidency in Russia, and German/European-led efforts at greater economic cooperation meant less to Putin, who was increasingly turning Russia into an autocracy verging on dictatorship, and who remained bitter and vindictive over the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Putin’s ire grew over this period, as revealed in a signature speech at the Munich Security Conference in 2007 and his decision to invade Georgia in 2008, a war that nearly resulted in the overthrow of the Georgian government. In 2014, after Ukraine’s pro-Russian president fled the country following protests that started when he abandoned plans for an association agreement with the EU in favor of one with Russia, Putin sent “little green men” to bloodlessly seize Crimea (already home to Russia’s Black Sea Fleet). Then, in a much bloodier fashion, Putin provided aid and direct support for proxy militias in the country’s eastern Donbas region that same year. That conflict never relented. NATO started providing varying degrees of military training and help for Ukraine from 2014-2022, though only on a modest scale, as few foresaw the terrible calamity that was to follow. Meanwhile, Russia completed a 10-year military modernization program; the deck was stacked for what would soon follow.
Overview of the war
The broad story of Russia’s all-out attack on Ukraine, dating from February 24, 2022, can be sketched in roughly the following terms. On that date, after several months of troop buildups combined with preposterous ultimatums to NATO and Ukraine, Russia launched a broad assault against Ukraine with a particular emphasis on the capital of Kyiv. Huge Russian forces descended from Belarus and Russian territory toward the Ukrainian capital—the distance between the Belarusian border and Kyiv, in particular, is about 100 kilometers, making the attack seem like a straight shot. Russia also sought to capture an airport north of Kyiv, perhaps land thousands of troops there, and gain quick access to the city in a lightning strike—not unlike the way it had seized Crimea in 2014.
Fortunately, this time Ukraine was alert to the danger, largely because of American intelligence that had picked up compelling indicators that Russia’s troop buildup along Ukraine’s northern and eastern borders was more than a menacing feint. Ukraine managed to fend off the airfield attack, shooting down Russian aircraft as they approached. Its small infantry teams, using Javelin anti-tank weapons and benefiting from a robust communications grid and good tactical intelligence, also started halting the long Russian armored columns in their tracks along the frozen highway leading from Belarus to Kyiv. Russian troops stayed in their vehicles, failing to provide dismounted cover for the long and vulnerable columns of trucks and combat vehicles, allowing Ukraine to turn a menacing invasion force into a 40-mile-long burning traffic jam. Russian troops also committed massacres of unarmed, fleeing civilians in the nearby city of Bucha.
Thus, Russia’s initial assault on Ukraine, with its obvious intent of toppling the government and perhaps installing a puppet regime that Moscow could subsequently control, was stymied. In a second phase, Russia retreated across a wide swath of territory in northern and eastern Ukraine, giving up close to half the land it had just seized over the ensuing weeks. Then, in the course of the summer and fall, Ukraine made further headway in liberating conquered territories, taking several cities in the east and Kherson in the south by the end of 2022.
And there the front lines have largely remained ever since. To be sure, there has been movement. Ukraine attempted a broad-sector counteroffensive in 2023, making incremental headway here or there but largely failing, as Russia had dug in and adopted sound defensive tactics, in contrast to its incompetent invasion attempt the year before. Then, in 2024, Russia had its turn at a counteroffensive and had some modest successes in the country’s east, particularly since Ukraine had failed to develop its own fortified defensive positions in many areas (it was still hoping to go back on the offensive) and since Ukraine also had to await a delayed American military assistance package until Congress finally approved it in the spring. Over the rest of 2024, frontline positions stiffened further, and in strategic terms, a general stalemate seemed entrenched, with only modest hopes for either side to break through in 2025.
Two more key elements of the story, however, remain to be mentioned. First, Russia’s attacks on Ukrainian cities have been ferocious and quite often barbaric. Cities near the front lines have been hit hardest, but Kyiv and even cities further west have hardly been spared. Ukraine’s air defenses against the barrages of ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as (often Iranian-made) drones, have performed well. Still, the challenge’s sheer magnitude has meant that many Russian weapons have found their targets. Over the winter of 2023-2024, moreover, Russia determined that striking Ukrainian power plants might be its best hope of causing serious hardship, and political leverage, against Ukraine. With roughly half of the country’s power production capability significantly impaired or destroyed, this tactic appears to be potent and likely to be employed again in the coming winter.
More promising and hopeful has been another set of innovations: Ukraine’s use of drones and missiles has caused real shock and setback—and further risk—to Russian positions in Ukraine as well as to the Russian homeland itself. Most notable has been Ukraine’s success in damaging or sinking more than half of Russia’s Black Sea naval fleet, forcing surviving ships to relocate further east, as well as Ukraine’s attack on the Kerch bridge that has probably complicated Russia’s ability to supply its forces in Crimea.
Key battlefield realities and security indicators
The war in Ukraine has been a brutal and bloody fight to date. While it has not reached World War I Western-Front levels of sheer firepower and bloodshed, it often echoes the carnage of that earlier conflict. Even modern technologies such as drones, satellites, and cell phones have not changed this fundamental reality.
Today, by publicly available estimates, Russia fields more troops in Ukraine—almost 500,000—than are in the entire active-duty U.S. Army (452,000 in FY2024). Ukraine’s frontline numbers are lower, by approximately 150,000. But its overall military strength nationwide is in the range of 800,000. Recent changes to Ukraine’s conscription law, lowering the draft age from 27 to 25, suggest that Ukraine can likely sustain such a force at least for the next year or two. Whether it could grow the force further seems more dubious.
The war has essentially reached a standoff along the front lines, at least for the moment. Russia has held about 18% of Ukraine’s pre-2014 territory for nearly two years. Specifically, Russia controls all of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and substantial parts of four additional provinces that it has “annexed”: Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk, and Donetsk (the latter two together constituting the Donbas region). Were Russia to control all of those entities, it would have stolen almost a quarter of pre-2014 Ukraine. That said, Ukraine’s surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region on August 6, 2024, demonstrates its capability and resolve to push back and make gains on Russian soil."
35,"The US, the West, and international law in an age of strategic competition",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-us-the-west-and-international-law-in-an-age-of-strategic-competition/,Matias Spektor,"April 15, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"In this lecture, I want to tackle the following question: What’s in store for the global legal order now that the West—for all its power and influence—seems to be no longer hegemonic? In other words, as we enter a new age of strategic competition, should we be concerned about the so-called “rules-based order” and, if so, what should be the precise nature of our concern?
Finding alternative answers is rather urgent because if you move in trans-Atlantic circles or read the major newspapers and magazines in the English language, you will notice that one specific storyline is taking root quite rapidly. It holds that the future of international law hinges upon the changing balance of power between liberals in the West and their enemies in the West and beyond it. The enemies include the forces of illiberalism at home, autocratic Russia, autocratic China, and the multitude of nonaligned developing countries that, apparently devoid of any strong moral commitments, seek to take advantage of the current situation, hedging their bets rather than siding with the rising autocrats or the West.
This storyline now appears everywhere. Consider reactions in the West to Russia’s break with international law in its invasion of Ukraine. Much of the commentary has focused on Chinese support for Russia and its implications for international law as well as developing countries’ refusal to impose meaningful sanctions on Russia beyond formal condemnation in the U.N. General Assembly. If the postcolonial world is unwilling to punish such a glaring violation of the principle of non-intervention, the argument goes, it must be because these countries don’t care for rules, because they resent the West, or because they are beholden to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The same goes for those leaders and movements within the West who argue for suspending the current levels of support for Ukraine.
Or take the war in Gaza. In the wake of the horrific atrocity perpetrated last October by Hamas, commentators in the West have struggled to make sense of what is going on. First, it has been challenging to make sense of the South African case for charging Israel with genocide against the Palestinian people at the International Court of Justice, and the widespread support that followed from countries as varied as Ireland and Pakistan. Then, it has been challenging to understand the refusal of so many postcolonial countries to label Hamas a terrorist organization. And then there is the issue of profound domestic division along demographic lines over support for Israeli policy across the Western world. Explanations proliferate, but they invariably return to the idea that changes are taking place that could affect the global legal order as we know it.
It is easy to see why the traditional “the liberal West against the illiberal rest” motto should remain so attractive. The idea of a law-abiding Western community confronting rivals who are bent on upending the existing legal order is appealing in its simplicity. But today I want to argue that this mode of thinking is empirically inaccurate and politically dangerous. It is inaccurate because it assumes modern international law and its liberal features are primarily a product of Western preferences rather than the outcome of hard-fought political battles across cultural and regional divides. It is inaccurate also because it ignores the extent to which the West often hurts the legal principles it helped create and the degree to which its officials have been willing to sacrifice core norms at the altar of great power competition. And it is politically dangerous because it fails to acknowledge the fact that doing battle against illiberalism at home and abroad will require a much deeper engagement between liberals in the West and liberals outside the West than we have seen thus far. If we are to properly protect the global legal order in an age of strategic competition, we should retire the “West versus the rest” framework and come up with something better instead.
Making international law
To begin, I want to turn to the historical evolution of the modern legal order. By modern legal order I mean the codified rules, norms, and institutions that have evolved to govern relations between nation-states. From the nineteenth century onwards, this order began to feature ingredients drawn from the liberal tradition, with a focus on promoting peace among nations by way of increasing global wealth through free economic exchange, limiting the use of force through the law, and, over time, promoting the end of empire, fostering self-determination and sovereignty rights, and protecting the rights of individuals. Tracing back the turbulent evolution of the legal global order and its liberal components reveals that Europe featured prominently in the story, but it was far from alone.
In the European order of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the colonial system determined who enjoyed legal standing, who could trade, where migrants would flow, and whose culture would provide acceptable pathways for progress. By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, however, European dominance of the international legal system had come under serious challenge. Leading the revolt were the United States and Japan, India and China, Haiti in the Caribbean, and the bulk of newly-independent Latin America. Their legal opposition against empire opened the door to key struggles over freedom that would play out well into the twentieth century—the struggle for sovereignty and decolonization, for racial equality, for economic justice, and for cultural liberation.
In the wake of World War I, the victorious powers at Paris surely laid down the roots for what would become the Covenant of the League of Nations, but as recent histories have shown, one of the most relevant outcomes was the unexpected spread of the norm of self-determination, evolving in ways that European and American diplomats did not expect or control.
Other recent historical work sheds similar light on the dense network of norms and regulations that made up the U.S.-led order built around 1945. The United Nations was not a gift from the West to the postwar world, but the outcome of a hard-fought battle over principles and the distribution of power between the Security Council and the General Assembly. Turning American and British designs for the Bretton Woods institutions into reality involved painstaking negotiations with Latin American nations that would be their first clients. The building of the trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific alliance system is not a story of U.S. officials deploying sticks and carrots to rally subordinate states around their cause, but a story of interactions with much weaker polities that deeply affected the character of the Cold War order. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons saw two superpowers collude to advance non-proliferation, but in exchange for concessions that originally they were unprepared to make.
What I am suggesting is that what we now call the “rules-based order” was not created by Western fiat. The Non-Aligned Conference at Bandung in 1955 and the Suez Crisis in 1956 set the stage for countries to legally challenge the colonial entitlements of their former metropoles. Resistance to Western dominance from Angola to Vietnam, Algeria to Afghanistan, paved the way for many of the rules constraining the use of force that we now have. The trade law that we now know was deeply shaped by former colonies asserting permanent jurisdiction over their natural resources, and by coalitions of countries from the postcolonial world who pushed against Western protectionism. The human rights revolution of the 1970s and 1980s cannot be understood without reference to postcolonial civil society organizations trying to curb the ability of Western powers to support brutal dictators in the Third World. In doing this, non-Western players built and leveraged transnational connections with Western government officials, intellectuals, members of the U.S. Congress, leaders of the opposition, and civil society movements and organizations.
Or consider the neoliberal revolution. During the 1980s and 1990s, the West reasserted its dominance on multiple fronts, pushing for market reform, deregulation, and selective democracy promotion on a global scale. The United States in particular worked to avoid the constraints of international law by expanding the practice of the extraterritorial application of American domestic law, sometimes through the imposition of sanctions, sometimes through the establishment of certification processes. During this period, it became evident that international law was rapidly transitioning from a traditional model of a thin contractual system of rules negotiated by state representatives into a much denser network of principles and procedures including international panels, courts, and methods for arbitration. These changes opened up unprecedented avenues for political action on the part not only of weaker nations but also of transnational coalitions of central bankers, policy experts, legal scholars, social activists, and members of various churches.
The idea that the rules that govern our world today were concocted within a Western community before outsiders were invited to join is largely fictional. This is why the “West versus the rest” concept is so deeply problematic. It implies not only a law-abiding West confronting a law-breaking rest, but it also implies that an enlightened, liberal compact faced a backward, illiberal opponent. It paints the global legal order as resulting from an all-dominant master that effectively controlled helpless subordinates devoid of agency. And it ignores the transnational currents that have historically connected Western and non-Western societies in ways that even the most powerful states have found impossible to control.
But before we can effectively retire the “liberal West versus the illiberal rest” framework, we must grapple with two very important issues that it brings to the fore.
Law and the changing balance of power
First, implied in the “liberal West versus the illiberal rest” framework is the notion that the end of Western hegemony will seriously hurt the rules-based order and most specifically its liberal components. The underlying idea here is that there is a deep connection between the global balance of power, on the one hand, and the character of the legal order on the other.
The standard narrative that is now being revived with full force is the notion that Western hegemony has been a precondition for the global rule of law, and liberal law at that. But is this indeed the case?
Cast your minds back to the moment that best represents the height of Western hegemony, at least in our generation: unipolarity. This was that rare historical period in which America was the only great power in the world, and the global legal system was ripe for liberal transformation. And yet, in the wake of 9/11, the “war on terror” taught us the bitter lesson that liberal great powers can do an awful lot of illiberal things, especially when their power is unchecked.
The policy decisions that followed 9/11 marked a major departure from the decades-long consolidation of the rules-based order. Powerful constraints on the use of force were upended first by the second Bush administration in Iraq and then by the Obama administration in Libya. Liberal America debated the conditions under which torture could be legal, and how best to avoid accountability for targeted killings in foreign lands. The “responsibility to protect” doctrine revived arguments for humanitarian intervention that to all practical effect suspended standard conceptions of state sovereignty. And ideas reemerged which had been dormant for a century, such as the utility of protectorates and notions of graduated sovereignty. Two pillars of the global legal order suffered enormously as a result: self-determination and human rights.
The same can be said of the impact of the unipolar moment on the rules of global economic governance. The push for deregulation and the abandonment of the “embedded liberalism” that had been at the heart of the Western order for much of the Cold War unleashed economic dynamics that fueled demands for protectionism and mercantilist thinking within the West. By the 2010s, the rules-based order was under threat not primarily from non-Western states but by developments in the West.
So, it is no wonder that much of the world—including diehard liberals outside the West—should welcome the end of Western preponderance. The argument here is that if you are weak and you care about freedom and liberty, then the balance of power is critical. When power is hegemonic, the strong get to throw caution out of the window and conduct policy that is capricious. From this perspective, multipolarity can be virtuous precisely in protecting liberal elements in a global order. Indeed, there is a deep-rooted tradition in Western liberal thought according to which a balance of power makes the preservation of freedom possible in the first place.
Might the end of Western hegemony and the emergence of more balanced power bode well for the future of liberal principles enshrined in the global legal order? Does such an expectation even make any sense at a historical time when those who balance Western hegemony are not liberal great powers, but autocratic Russia and China?
I cannot answer these questions here, but it is important to make one point that normally gets no attention in the contemporary discussion about the global legal order. For many countries around the world today, it is clear that both Russia and China are willing (and increasingly able) to revise the rules they are unhappy with, selectively. But it is equally clear that neither Moscow nor Beijing is willing to burn down the “rules-based order.” They have used international law extensively in recent years to cement their ascent, and using the language and practices of legal argument has played an essential role in legitimizing their growing authority in world politics. From this standpoint, neither Russia nor China can be described as radically revisionist—even if Russia has illegally conquered territory and launched war, and even if China is overtly challenging maritime law. In this view, China and Russia, like all great powers, including the United States, will break the rules they don’t like, try as much as possible to push for the rules they like, and use vast amounts of hypocrisy to justify their preferences. From the vantage point of the majority of countries today, then, the option is not so much between a world safe for democracy versus a world safe for autocracy, but a world where the strong are unconstrained versus a world where there is some balance.
Civilization versus truth: Pick your standard
The second issue that the “liberal West versus the illiberal rest” framework brings to the fore and we must tackle head-on is that of the relationship between culture and the present legal order.
There is a long tradition of thinking that links international law not to sovereign states negotiating rules with one another but with a community of shared values—be they rooted in Christianity or the broader ideals of civilization. The so-called “standard of civilization” was at the heart of Western conceptions of legal order in the age of European preponderance and in the age of American ascent. It was used to justify not only territorial conquest and colonization but also unequal treaties and the imposition of international legal norms that often undermined the sovereignty and cultural practices of non-Western societies.
But the “standard of civilization” never fully died. The view that the rules and norms that sustain the international order can hold or break along civilizational lines has retained its purchase. Oswald Spengler’s “The Decline of the West” (1922) postulated the idea that global political dynamics follow civilizational cycles. In the 1930s, Arnold Toynbee argued in a “Study of History” that the chief purpose of social elites is to keep civilization alive in the face of external challenges that might make it decline. In the 1990s, Samuel Huntington reignited this conversation with his “Clash of Civilizations,” positing that with the end of the Cold War, conflict would be driven along cultural divides. In 2010, Henry Kissinger placed “the character of nations” at the heart of his analysis of global order, arguing for the centrality of national cultural traits in sustaining a stable international system. The “West versus the rest” framework echoes these ideas.
There are many ways to criticize such an essentialist take on how culture shapes international norms. It is discriminatory, it serves to legitimize the subjugation of non-Western peoples, it imposes a homogenizing model of statehood that fails to appreciate the diversity of political life, it is emblematic of the historical injustices associated with colonialism and imperialism, etc. But I want to highlight another dimension: a major problem with these perspectives is that they completely miss the fact that liberalism has been a powerful force in politics and culture well beyond the West. Liberal voices have been prominent in societies across the board, North and South, East and West. This multiplicity of liberal perspectives is normally lost in the conversation about the rules-based order, when it should not be.
Rather than fictionalize the differences between an Enlightened West and a backward rest around a “standard of civilization,” should we, as self-regarding liberals, not push for a universal “standard of truth?” This would require us to go beyond the confines of our narrow national origins and familiar cultural attachments, developing some ability to see the world through the eyes of others. If we succeed, we might conclude that if we condemn the indiscriminate use of violence against civilians by our enemies, we should be able to hold our allies, our partners, and indeed ourselves to the same standard.
Pathways forward
In this lecture, I have tried to suggest that the “liberal West versus illiberal rest” concept that is now so ubiquitous is reductive to the point that it limits our capacity to think about how we are going to go about protecting the international legal order in an age of great power competition.
I have argued that, historically, the construction of the global legal order cannot be described as a Western invention that then brought lesser nations on board. I have also argued that the threats to the rules-based order do not come exclusively from illiberal actors at home and abroad, but also from unchecked power in the hands of liberals. And I have tried to make the case that liberalism is a rich tradition with a multitude of expressions far beyond the West.
Let me close by leaving you with four thoughts about how we might cope with our current predicament.
First, we must let go of the expectation that countries grappling with the evolution of the global legal order will coalesce around some kind of moral consensus. In a world of multiple centers of international power and authority, all we can hope for is heated deliberation, a lot of contestation, and, if lucky, uncoerced persuasion. The clash between alternative readings of international law is not a bad, but a good, thing: after all, the alternative to battle through legal argument is battle through war. The simplistic dichotomy of “Us versus Them” did nobody any good in the unipolar era and is likely to do no good in the currently multipolar one.
Second, for a long time now, the West has coped with charges of hypocrisy coming from across the board. Hypocrisy happens when a country’s foreign policy is divorced from its stated principles, and the principles carry an air of moral superiority. For a long time, Western countries could afford to shrug off these charges, justifying their behavior by stating the fact that policymakers always have to make difficult tradeoffs between words and deeds. But in a world of multiple great powers, being seen as a hypocrite carries a greater cost. This happens because those who feel victimized by hypocrisy feel more empowered to deny cooperation to the hypocrite. In a more competitive world, therefore, the West would do well to respond to the hypocrisy charge not by shrugging it off, but by actually specifying measures that would permit it to begin complying with the principles that its behavior violates.
Third, in recent years, U.S. policymakers on the right and left have signaled they are willing to abandon many of the rules of the postwar order to compete with China and Russia. This may include mercantilistic economic policies, abandoning the World Trade Organization, siding with dictators as long as they are friendly, helping topple unfriendly regimes, letting go of arms control, and threatening to use force. For the majority of the world’s countries, this is hardly an attractive proposition.
And finally, in the aftermath of World War II, the architects of the Western order understood full well that their political project would require active social engagement across the Atlantic. As a result, they worked hard to build the trans-Atlantic connections that could sustain liberal opinion across members of the extended West, including not only the United States and Europe but also Japan. We have not seen a similar effort to bridge the gap between the West and the rest. To be sure, American universities, think tanks, and government have engaged democratic leaders, human rights activists, and legal scholars from a broad range of backgrounds. But there has been no serious attempt at mapping and engaging liberal opinion in the non-Western world to ensure that both the content and rhetoric of Western policy facilitate engagement rather than fuel backlash. We have seen illiberal social movements across the board try to create transnational connections. What should be the liberal response? Now, this, I think, would be a productive way to better integrate the West and the rest for those who worry about the future of the global legal order in an age of strategic competition."
36,"Tunisia abandons two-state solution; courts Iran, China, and Russia",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/tunisia-abandons-two-state-solution-courts-iran-china-and-russia/,Sharan Grewal,"June 5, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Last week, Tunisia’s president, Kais Saied, made his first trip to China and signed a strategic partnership with President Xi Jinping. The week prior, Saied made headlines for becoming the first Tunisian president to visit Iran since the Islamic Revolution. And before that, rumors swirled about Russian planes landing in Djerba.
It is too early to tell whether any of these events mark a major, strategic realignment of Tunisia away from its traditional allies in the West. More likely, Saied is playing global and regional powers against one other to secure the best deal, an art form perfected by other leaders in the region.
But Saied has made one major shift to Tunisia’s foreign policy that in turn might help explain his recent outreach to Iran, China, and Russia. Over the past year, Saied has overseen a sea change in Tunisia’s position on the two-state solution for Israelis and the Palestinians. While Tunisia had historically been an outlier in the region for being one of the first to accept a two-state solution, today it is increasingly becoming an outlier for rejecting it.
While popular at home, this shift has strained Tunisia’s relations with both the West and the Arab Gulf states. It is in this context of greater isolation internationally that Saied now dangles the threat of relations with Iran, China, and Russia.
The first to endorse two states
Tunisia’s founding father, Habib Bourguiba (r. 1956-1987), was one of the first Arab leaders to advocate, albeit cautiously, for negotiations with Israel. While other states in the region were gearing up for war, President Bourguiba in 1965 gave a major speech in Jericho urging Palestinians and Arabs to give up their “all or nothing” strategy, and then told Le Monde that they should accept the United Nations partition plan.
At the United States’ request, Tunisia would later host the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), and despite being bombed by Israel in 1985, Bourguiba remained supportive of dialogue until his last days in office. His successor, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali (r. 1987-2011), continued his policies, facilitating talks between the PLO and Israeli officials in Tunis that would then evolve into the Oslo peace process. Although those talks faltered and the second intifada erupted, Ben Ali would sign on to the Arab Peace Initiative (API), advocating a two-state solution. Tunisia’s support for that proposition would survive the 2011 revolution, with Tunisia hosting an Arab League summit in March 2019 that renewed the region’s commitment to the API. For almost 60 years, Tunisia at least paid lip service to the notion of a two-state solution.
The first to abandon it
Saied (r. 2019-) has now initiated a major shift to that long-standing advocacy of two states. In his electoral campaign in 2019, Saied argued that any normalization with Israel was akin to high treason, receiving thunderous applause at a presidential debate. While Saied was initially constrained by Tunisia’s semi-presidential system, his power grab in 2021 and subsequent consolidation of control has allowed him to gradually shift Tunisia’s foreign policy.
At first, the shift was subtle. Saied’s new 2022 constitution went further than previous ones by calling not just for the liberation of Palestine but a Palestinian state with Jerusalem (and not just East Jerusalem) as its capital. In August 2023, Saied rejected rumors he might normalize with Israel, saying Palestinians should instead regain their rights over “all of Palestine.”
But Hamas’s attacks on October 7 and the war thereafter have accelerated Saied’s break with Tunisia’s more moderate tradition. On the night of October 7, Saied described the attacks as “legitimate resistance,” saying that “what some media were referring to as the Gaza envelope is Palestinian land that has been under Zionist occupation for decades,” and that therefore “the Palestinian people have the right to recover it and to recover all of the land of Palestine.” In a video published on his Facebook page, Saied re-emphasized “all” of the land.
What had previously been the president’s personal rhetoric then became official policy. On October 11, the Arab League put out a joint statement condemning the killing of civilians by both sides and pledging support for a two-state solution along the June 4, 1967 borders. But Saied had Tunisia put in a reservation, noting instead “the right of the Palestinian people to establish their independent state on all of the land of Palestine.” Tunisia would continue that pattern over the next few months, routinely issuing reservations to joint statements produced at Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) summits, becoming an outlier at these meetings.
In May, these reservations grew increasingly explicit. At the OIC summit in Banjul and then the Arab League summit in Manama, Tunisia expressed its reservations specifically about the use of the terms “June 4, 1967 borders,” “two-state solution,” and “East al-Quds,” emphasizing instead its support for an “independent state on the entire territory of Palestine with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.” For all intents and purposes, Tunisia abandoned its long-standing official position supporting a two-state solution.
Consequences of the shift
This shift in Tunisian foreign policy has played well at home, earning praise from Tunisians on social media and even from the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Tunisian General Labor Union. In part because of their history of hosting the PLO—and being bombed for it—Tunisians express some of the strongest support for Palestine in public opinion polls. The Arab Barometer, for instance, found that only 9% of Tunisians said it was good for the region that countries have started working with Israel, compared to 19% of Iraqis and Lebanese, 23% of Egyptians, and 32% of Sudanese. This pro-Palestinian sentiment in Tunisia has only grown in the wake of October 7, with the Arab Barometer finding support for normalization with Israel falling from 12% to 1%, and open calls for armed resistance growing from 6% to 36%.
But although Saied’s rhetoric on Israel has garnered him popularity at home, it has also left him even more isolated internationally. He had already complicated Tunisia’s relations with the United States through his coup and continued rejection of what he calls foreign interference. This was simply another nail in the coffin. By November, U.S. State Department officials were telling me they were highly concerned that Saied had become “an outlier in the region,” no longer supportive of a two-state solution. They feared that his “radical rhetoric against Israel” might contribute to extremism, recalling that Tunisia sent the largest per capita contingent of fighters to the Islamic State.
Saied’s positions have also complicated his relations with the Arab Gulf states, who have pursued normalization or are on track to do so. Many had expected Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to openly and financially support Saied’s takeover much like they did Egypt’s Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. But they have instead been more hesitant, preferring investment over aid and loans, and allegedly insisting on normalization, or at least toning down Saied’s criticism of it.
Managing isolation
This has left Saied with few strong allies, primarily Algeria and Italy. It is in this context of isolation that we should view Saied’s recent outreach to Iran, China, and Russia. On the one hand, these countries more naturally fit with Saied’s worldview, both on the Palestinian issue as well as on his broader critique of Western imperialism. Saied’s meeting with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, for instance, reportedly centered around Palestine, with Khamenei praising Saied’s “anti-Zionist stance” and emphasizing the need to develop more such stances in the Arab world, and Saied agreeing, saying “the Islamic world must exit its current passive position.”
At the same time, Saied has thus far been careful not to push too far and elicit a rupture with Tunisia’s traditional allies. In November, for instance, Saied quashed a bill in parliament that would have criminalized normalization with Israel, on account of it endangering Tunisia’s external interests, presumably with the West and the Arab Gulf states. Indeed, a full realignment or clean break with the West is near impossible, given the strong links Tunisia’s military has with the United States and its economy has with Europe. A more likely scenario is an attempt to balance between these global and regional powers, securing what it can from each.
Still, whether or not relations with Iran, China, or Russia develop further, it is clear that Saied has already initiated a sea change in one aspect of Tunisia’s foreign policy, departing from its decades-long endorsement of a two-state solution."

Pipa, Zoe Swarzenski","November 19, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Introduction
The passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 (IIJA), the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (CHIPS), and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) enabled generational federal investments in infrastructure, clean energy, innovation, and economic security. Our earlier analysis identified more than $464 billion in immediate appropriations with particular significance to the community and economic development aspirations of rural places.1
Many of these programs award their funds to intermediaries, who then assume the responsibility for deciding upon and regranting those funds to their ultimate recipients. Out of the 111 programs that we initially cataloged as having particular significance to rural places, we analyze here a subset of 40 programs that award their funding through intermediaries.2
Together, these programs comprise over $218 billion in funding—nearly half of the total rural-significant appropriations from our earlier analysis. Amid the magnitude of the opportunity, understanding the timing and the pathways for distributing these funds has important implications for rural communities, since they often face significant challenges in accessing federal investment."
39,Will Raisi's death destabilize Iran?,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/will-raisis-death-destabilize-iran/,Suzanne Maloney,"May 20, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"The death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash has dealt a major shock to Iran’s Islamic Republic at a precarious moment for the sclerotic clerical state and the broader Middle East. Although Raisi was not Iran’s ultimate authority, he was the paragon of the regime’s bureaucratization of brutality. His demise will reshape the looming succession process for Iran’s geriatric leadership and reverberate across a region beset by violence that Tehran has fueled.
The Islamic Republic has weathered monumental challenges since its establishment after the 1979 revolution that ousted the monarchy, including many that have imposed massive costs on the regime but failed to dislodge or durably weaken it. Still, that same history may elevate the leadership’s deeply ingrained paranoia, especially coming only weeks after a historic escalation in its “shadow war” with Israel. For a ruling system that prioritizes nothing over its own survival, the loss of a favored son will stoke a sense of threat and potentially precipitate a backlash against its citizens and its neighbors. Raisi’s death raises the temperature in an already combustible region and adds a new wild card to the Biden administration’s delicate diplomatic choreography between Saudi Arabia and Israel as it is nearing its culmination.
Raisi’s death amid regime transition
The crash occurred as the president’s delegation was returning to Iran after inaugurating a dam on Iran’s border with Azerbaijan along with that country’s president. In addition to Raisi, the helicopter was carrying Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, a diplomat with extensive ties to Tehran’s security bureaucracy who had played a central role in shaping Iran’s expanding influence across the broader Middle East.
As president, Raisi sat near the apex of power in Iran’s unique ruling system and exerted considerable influence on the country’s politics, society, economy, and external relations. His untimely death elevates first Vice President Mohammad Mokhber, former head of a massive state enterprise controlled by the Supreme Leader, to assume the president’s responsibilities. It will also precipitate new elections in 50 days, requiring unusually hasty improvisation by a regime that has become increasingly ossified and unpopular as it approaches its half-century mark.
This scenario poses real risks for a regime that had sought to engineer its transition from the original revolutionary generation to its uninspiring heirs. While the raucous contestation among the theocracy’s mandarins has been settled in favor of hardliners, infighting among the conservative camp remains intense and will escalate around new opportunities to seize the advantage.
Add to this challenge that Iran’s beleaguered representative institutions command little interest or respect from its citizenry, as evidenced by the record low turnout in recent parliamentary elections. Instead, Iranians have turned to the streets and the internet to express their political aspirations. An unexpected political opening may spark new activism against the regime, as highlighted by the scenes of Iranians celebrating the news of the crash that have begun to leak onto social media.
Even more momentously, the president’s demise upends years of politicking and careful orchestration in preparation for the eventual passing of Iran’s ultimate authority, the 85-year-old supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Since he took the helm of the Islamic Republic in 1989 after the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the revolutionary state’s charismatic founder, Khamenei has consolidated power under the auspices of his office and endorsed an aggressive approach to power projection that has vastly expanded Iran’s regional sway. Sustaining that internal dominance and external ascendancy will test whoever comes next.
Unsurprisingly, Iran’s repressive regime has not produced a surfeit of highly qualified contenders for unaccountable leadership. The generation that prevailed in the 1979 revolution is quickly aging out and as the theocracy’s political elite has narrowed and hardened, the pool of prospective candidates who are willing and capable of imposing orthodoxy on an increasingly young and secularized population has shrunk considerably.
Over recent years, Raisi had emerged as one of the leading candidates to assume the position of supreme leader after Khamenei passes from the scene. A dour cleric, Raisi’s primary credentials appeared to be his ruthlessness—in 1988, he was one of several judges who sent thousands of political prisoners to their deaths after sham trials—and his family connections to the powerful wing of Iran’s religious establishment based in Mashhad.
Aside from Raisi, the most prominent contender for the next supreme leader is Khamenei’s son, Mojtaba, who has wielded considerable informal power behind the scenes and has built deep relationships with the Revolutionary Guard Corps and other components of the security services. His name is frequently invoked by Iranians as a likely successor to his father, but many also question his qualifications based on a lack of leadership experience, limited religious credentials, and decades of regime rhetoric denouncing hereditary leadership.
Formally, the succession process is managed by a clerical body whose members are determined by Iran’s heavily stage-managed elections; in practice, campaigning has been underway for years, as has a planning process authorized by the current supreme leader. One of the three members of the committee empowered to assess prospective contenders was none other than Raisi himself.
Conspiracies and consequences
The crash was likely caused by mundane factors—scenes of the rescue efforts showed inclement weather and dense fog. And for years, Iranians have complained that U.S. and international sanctions left the country vulnerable to dangerous aviation issues as a result of aging or poorly maintained equipment—a grievance that Iranian officials resurfaced in the wake of the crash.
Still, the high stakes will only fuel the conspiracy theories that were percolating from the earliest reports of helicopter troubles. Such suspicions draw from a deep well of experience with internal violence and external sabotage. During the revolution’s early years, competition between the revolutionary coalition’s divergent components precipitated a vicious power struggle and acts of terror that killed—among others—a number of influential clerics, cabinet ministers, members of parliament, the president, and the prime minister. Khamenei himself lost the use of his right hand as a result of a 1981 assassination attempt.
The regime fought back with a campaign to kill its critics both within and outside Iran as well as enduring efforts to target dissidents in the United States, Europe, and beyond. In 1996, Iran’s security services attempted to kill 21 writers by disabling their bus in the mountains of northwestern Iran, not far from where Raisi’s helicopter crashed—an episode that was later made into a film whose director fled the country only last week on foot to avoid prosecution for his art.
That history may predispose many among Iran’s leadership and population to cynical interpretations of the crash. And coming little more than a month since Iranian authorities undertook an unprecedented attack on Israel—launching more than 300 drones and cruise and ballistic missiles at the Jewish state in response to an Israeli strike that killed senior Iranian military officials in Damascus—many may see this as a deferred reprisal by Israel. Israel has demonstrated extraordinary success in undertaking deadly operations within Iranian territory, including a string of assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists.
Ultimately, however, the conspiracy theories are almost certainly off the mark. Raisi’s fiery demise on the side of a fog-covered mountain represents merely the latest chapter in the Islamic Republic’s 45-year litany of miscalculations. As ordinary Iranians—and their neighbors across the Middle East—know all too well, Tehran’s strategic blunders often have catastrophic consequences."
40,"What were the climate policies in the IRA, and what will happen to them after the 2024 election?",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-were-the-climate-policies-in-the-ira-and-what-will-happen-to-them-after-the-2024-election/,Catherine Wolfram,"October 15, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Transcript
What is the IRA and how will it affect US greenhouse gas emissions?
The Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, is one of President Biden’s signature pieces of legislation. It was a big bill, with provisions on health care costs, drug pricing, and tax enforcement. Perhaps most notably, the law included the most significant steps to address climate change that the federal government has ever taken. It includes large tax credits and rebates for households investing in clean energy and electric vehicles, major investments in national clean energy infrastructure, and some taxes for producers of fossil fuels.
All together, the climate provisions of the IRA will reduce emissions by up to an additional 11% below 2005 levels as compared to the business-as-usual scenario. This the leads to a total expected emissions reduction of 35% to 40% below 2005 levels. That’s a big deal. But that change won’t come cheap: estimates of total cost are around $1 trillion over 10 years. At a macro level, there is ongoing debate on whether and to what degree the impact on the deficit will be offset by other aspects of the IRA, including raising the minimum tax on corporate profits and crackdowns on tax evasion.
What does the IRA mean for US households?
It’s important to remember that the North Star here is addressing climate change, and that reducing greenhouse gas emissions will benefit the entire world, not just those of us in the U.S. And it’s important that we think about how what we do in the U.S. impacts the fight against climate change everywhere. That said, there are certainly direct benefits of the IRA for U.S. households. For example, the law includes up to $7,500 in tax credits for the purchase of new electric vehicles, a 30% tax credit for installing solar panels on a home, and $14,000 in rebates for upgrading to energy efficient home appliances. U.S. households will also benefit from the tax credits for renewable electricity, which are projected to reduce electricity bills over time.
In addition, this injection into the green economy is creating jobs in the U.S., with obvious benefits for those workers and their families.
How does the IRA factor into the election?
While polling suggests that the IRA has enjoyed broad popularity, some of the climate change proposals are less popular among Republican lawmakers. The Trump campaign has signaled that it would seek to end the tax credits promoting electric vehicle purchases, and some experts have suggested that a Trump administration could also reduce credits for clean energy production. Indeed, House Republicans have already introduced over 20 bills attacking parts of the IRA. Then again, 18 House Republicans recently sent a letter encouraging their colleagues not to repeal the IRA, so a lot remains to be seen about what will happen after the November elections.
Vice President Harris was the tie-breaking vote on the IRA, and she has been a strong environmental advocate in the past. Although she hasn’t yet announced an official climate policy plan, as the new Democratic candidate, we can expect that she would protect the IRA and, depending on the outcome of Congressional elections, find ways to expand on it."

Payment systems are primarily thought to function to maximize economic growth. The U.S. dollar’s status as world reserve currency provides America a unique ability to use the payment system to achieve national objectives besides economic growth. America has increasingly relied on the payment system to achieve non-economic objectives, mostly in the realm of foreign policy but not exclusively. The paper analyzes the growing usage of payment systems as a tool for projecting international power and achieving domestic political goals, with a focus on the Western response to Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine. The paper concludes by discussing the ramifications of increased reliance on the payment system for the projection of American foreign policy, including China’s development of an alternative payment system and the rise of cryptocurrency as a new payment system."
42,What is Russia's role in the Israel-Gaza crisis?,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-is-russias-role-in-the-israel-gaza-crisis/,"Fiona Hill, Kevin Huggard","January 31, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"KEVIN HUGGARD:
What was Russia’s approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict before Oct. 7? What was its approach to Hamas?
FIONA HILL:
The Russian approach has changed over time. During the Soviet period and the Cold War, there was a great deal of hostility toward Israel, which was tied to deeply rooted domestic antisemitism as well as the Kremlin’s suspicion of Soviet Jews having divided loyalties after the creation of the state of Israel in 1948. The USSR actively blocked Soviet Jews from leaving the country to settle in Israel, or anywhere else for that matter. There was quite a lot of attention paid inside the Soviet Union to building up relationships with the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and Arab countries opposed to the state of Israel. The USSR offered educational opportunities to Palestinian and other Arab students. I was a student in Moscow in 1987 and 1988, and, as a “Western” student, lived in a Moscow university long-stay hotel, which was next to several student dormitories. The largest contingent next to us was Arab students, some of whom were Palestinians who went on later to become prominent in organizations like the PLO and Fatah.
In the 1990s, beginning with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev’s co-hosting with U.S. President George H.W. Bush of the March 1991 Madrid conference on the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Russian government played a role in international efforts to move toward a two-state solution, but the relationship with Israel was still very tense. In the 1990s and early 2000s, after the collapse of the USSR, restrictions on leaving the country were lifted. There was a wave of Jewish migration from Russia and other post-Soviet countries like Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine, and from the Caucasus and Central Asia. Most went to Israel as well as to the United States, and to some extent to Europe. The sustained mass emigration to Israel eventually shifts Moscow’s perspective.
By the time Vladimir Putin comes along in 2000, over 1 million Israelis have some kind of heritage from the former Soviet Union. Many are predominantly Russian-speaking, and over time Putin starts to see this population as an opportunity for Russia because he also has personal ties to Jewish families he grew up with in Leningrad, later St. Petersburg, as a child in the 1950s and 1960s after World War II. He grew up in a communal apartment and talks frequently in his semi-autobiography about an elderly Jewish couple who in a way became his de facto parents, his guardians of sorts, because his parents were always out at work. They were the people who lived in the same space as him and looked after him. He also talks about his favorite teacher at school, who taught him German. He’s fascinated with the German language and wanted to study it, and later, that becomes an entry point for him into the KGB. His German teacher was also Jewish, and she emigrated to Israel; it’s documented that he visited her on official state visits and also bought her a flat for her retirement.
I say all this not just because it’s interesting, but more because Putin’s personal connections seemed to shape the Russian-Israeli relationship in the early 2000s. Putin talks frequently about “our Jews” (the term he uses is nashi Yevrei) to talk about the Russian-speaking Israeli population. He sees them as a repository of ties tightening the relationship between Israel and Russia, as well as a source of future economic investment, especially in high technology; he starts to encourage Israelis and other Jewish emigres in the United States and Europe, even people who were persecuted as dissidents in the past, to start coming back to Russia, investing, and becoming more active.
Putin builds a museum of Judaism in Moscow and becomes, as he says, the “patron of the Jews.” He regularly meets with one Moscow-based rabbi, Berel Lazar, and constantly repeats jokes that Lazar tells him. In fact, the rabbi reputedly becomes one of his close confidants during his first presidential term. So, Putin creates this picture of a vibrant relationship with both Israel and the remnants of Russia’s Jewish communities. Putin designates Judaism as one of the official indigenous religions of Russia alongside orthodox Christianity and Islam. He sees this as part of Russia’s greatness—as a culture housing these three great world religions, and also Buddhism to some extent. It’s not that there aren’t tensions, of course. Many of the emigre Jewish groups who have archives and materials housed in Moscow—such as the library of the late Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, for example—and want them transferred to their communities in Israel, the United States, and elsewhere, end up clashing with the Kremlin. Putin refuses to relinquish the materials because he says they are part of Russian patrimony, Russian heritage. They were written or collected on the territory of the Russian Empire or the Soviet Union, so they belong to the Russian state, not a religious community.
Putin also uses the new relationship with Israel to enshrine Russia’s position in the Middle East. He sees Israel as a key pillar for Russian foreign policy in the Middle East, alongside Iran and Saudi Arabia, which makes for some strange bedfellows in Russian foreign policy. One of Putin’s foreign policy priorities is that Russia has good relations with everybody and can talk to everybody in the Middle East. And within that context, there come some pretty critical points. One is Russia’s intervention in the Syrian civil war in 2015. Israelis would disagree with this, but Putin claims that Moscow partly intervened to ensure Israel’s protection because Israel is threatened directly by Iran and by the activities of Iranian proxies like Hezbollah and the Islamic State inside Syria. He actually tells the Israelis that he’s there to secure Israel and make sure that there are no attacks on the Golan Heights. In this period immediately after the Russian intervention, Russia and Israel set up a deconfliction channel where Israel informs Russia of any strikes it will make against Iranian proxies in Syria, and Russia agrees to dissuade Iran and its proxies from counterattacks. The Russian presence in Syria becomes such an important factor that officials and commentators in Israel start to refer to Russia as “our neighbor to the north,” including in discussions with U.S. and other counterparts. I heard this reference directly from Israeli interlocutors while I was at the National Security Council. So, after 2015, Russia is now involved in Middle East politics in ways that it wasn’t before.
This is a dramatic shift from the Soviet period, and the Yeltsin period of the 1990s. Things move along to such an extent that in June 2019, when I was in the previous administration, there’s a tripartite meeting of national security advisors in Jerusalem, including Ambassador John Bolton, who’s the U.S. national security advisor at the time, National Security Advisor Meir Ben-Shabbat of Israel, and National Security Advisor Nikolai Patrushev of Russia. During that period, Putin makes it very clear that Russia sees itself as a major player in the region and that it puts a lot of stock in its relationship with Israel. Putin’s talking all the time about Israeli security, and many Israelis remark in our exchanges that Russia thinks it knows Israeli security better than Israel does, and that Moscow even sees itself as a kind of security guarantor in the Middle East in opposition to the United States.
Now all of that becomes completely and utterly ruptured or unglued—all the wheels fall off this bus, not just on October 7, but beforehand as a result of the war in Ukraine. In the last two years since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the Kremlin started calling Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Jewish president of Ukraine, a Nazi and directly offended Israel on this issue. Israel was very careful in how it handled the whole issue with Ukraine from the start, because so many of the Russian speakers from the Soviet Union in Israel were in fact from Ukraine and Belarus, not just from Russia, and many people rediscovered an affinity with Ukraine after the war. Israel didn’t want tensions among the various Russian-speaking Jewish communities to further complicate its domestic affairs.
But the bigger issue for Israel was not Russia’s fight with Zelenskyy about being Jewish and the Kremlin trying to denigrate him as a result—it was, and still is, about Russia over time becoming dependent on Iran for drones and other military and political support. Russia suffered many early setbacks on the battlefield as Ukraine received drones and drone technology from Turkey and then started to develop them for itself. Russia had not previously paid a lot of attention to drones in its military development, and suddenly Moscow had to turn to Tehran and the Shahed drones to help the Russian military push Ukraine back on the battlefield. As Russia turns to Iran, you start to see Russia’s relations with Israel sour even more.
October 7, 2023, becomes a final point of rupture for Russia and Israel. Putin starts to make antisemitic comments—quite evidently antisemitic comments he hasn’t made before. He publicly backs away from the very close relationship with Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu that he previously loved to tout at every opportunity. Netanyahu is Putin’s kind of guy; he falls into the same category as Hungarian President Viktor Orbán, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and Chinese President Xi Jinping as a strongman leader. Russians were always praising Netanyahu’s boldness and decisiveness of leadership and how Israel dealt with its regional security issues in meetings we had with them, but after October 7 the Kremlin has heaped criticism on Netanyahu and Israel. And then Russia quickly and publicly rekindled its relationships with the representatives of Hamas and other Palestinian constituencies; these associations are longstanding in Russia but had been tamped down over the last decade out of deference to Netanyahu.
There are some internal Russian imperatives at work here too. The Hamas attack on Israel and Israel’s massive retaliatory response have distinct echoes of Russia’s interventions in Chechnya, part of its own territory, between 1994 and 2009. Chechnya is one of Russia’s preeminent Muslim regions in the North Caucasus with a population of 1 million people. It attempted to secede and establish an independent state immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Roughly 250,000 people, including combatants and civilians, were estimated to have been killed over the span of a decade and two rounds of war in Chechnya. Prior to the war in Ukraine, this was Russia’s most significant and costly military action since World War II. In the battle for Grozny, the capital city was completely leveled, and thousands of people were killed in circumstances not dissimilar to what we’re seeing unfolding in Gaza. And Russia is now, of course, flipping that whole script, basically calling out Israel for the very same things it did in Grozny, in its own city, against non-Russian ethnic groups, Muslims, living in its own territory.
It’s not a direct parallel, but it’s definitely something to bear in mind, as the legacy of Chechnya does color Putin’s attitudes toward Gaza and rekindles fears of Russian domestic extremism. The Chechen cause became more radicalized over time, morphing from a national-liberation to more of a radical Wahhabi militant movement focused on suicide terrorist acts and spectacular, brutal assaults. Some of the religious and clan groups in Chechnya have representation in the Gulf and Jordan, as well as in Turkey, as the result of Muslims and Chechens fleeing to the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East when imperial Russia first expanded in the region. So, there is a direct link there; over the course of the Chechen wars, Jordanian and other Arab militants went to fight in Chechnya. Al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri even tried to relocate to Chechnya, and neighboring Dagestan, in the 1990s.
Putin ultimately relied on his relationships with people like Erdoğan in Turkey and leaders in Jordan and the Gulf to help him cut ties to regional militant groups and suppress the Chechens; then to help in the rebuilding of Grozny (which frankly looks like Dubai in the North Caucasus). Chechen fighters have been deployed to fight on Russia’s behalf in Ukraine since 2022, and the North Caucasus and other Muslim regions have been, or were, relatively quiescent until Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel and the Israeli military response. On October 29, 2023, there was a shocking incident in the Russian regional capital of Dagestan, Makhachkala, when a group of several hundred young Muslim men rioted and invaded the airport in search of an Israeli plane and Jewish passengers arriving from Tel Aviv. The scenes—reminiscent of those across the Arab world in reaction to the unfolding war in Gaza—rattled Moscow. Embracing Hamas and repudiating Israel is now tied to placating Russia’s own sizable Muslim population and heading off inter-ethnic and religious violence at home.
But beyond Russia rekindling old ties and worrying about domestic extremism, the big shift in the Russian relationship with Israel is rooted in Moscow’s increasingly close bilateral security relationship with Iran. I don’t think we can emphasize this enough. This development puts the rest of us—the United States and Europe—in quite a predicament. Russia is now engaged with Iran in two different conflicts, Ukraine and Israel/Gaza. Obviously, this is in quite different ways, but the Russia/Iran relationship greatly complicates the situation in the Middle East, Israel, and Gaza, and the battlefield in Ukraine. Russia’s relationship with Iran—not just Zelenskyy’s Jewish heritage, or all the Russian speakers of Jewish Ukrainian heritage in Israel—as well as the U.S. role in support of both Ukraine and Israel start to draw the two sets of conflicts into the same geopolitical frame."

Could you start with the basics of the Houthi movement? When and where did it emerge, and how have the Houthis come to rule much of Yemen?
ALLISON MINOR:
The Houthi movement emerged over two decades ago when a religious revivalist movement fused with anti-American sentiment and social discontent in a marginalized region of northern Yemen. The Houthis are motivated by fervent religious belief and a commitment to fighting corruption and imposing their social-political model in Yemen and potentially beyond. They have demonstrated a unique ability to adapt and seize windows of opportunity in Yemen’s tumultuous political environment.
Twenty years ago, the Yemeni government of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh launched a series of military campaigns against the Houthis in response to their growing popularity. However, the Houthis coalesced during this period and asserted themselves as a formidable and resilient fighting force.
After popular protests and elite wrangling ousted Saleh in 2011, the Houthis adapted again, joining the protests and transition process. In 2015, in an unlikely turn of events, Saleh allied with the Houthis, whom he viewed as his best path to reassuming power. Yet this plan eventually backfired, and the Houthis killed him in 2017. The Houthis used Saleh’s considerable resources and network to rapidly expand their control across northern Yemen. In September 2014, the Houthis seized Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, and eventually overthrew the transitional government. A Saudi-led coalition campaign launched in 2015 pushed the Houthis out of southern Yemen but left the Houthis in control of most of northern Yemen.
Fueled by Iranian military support and expertise, the Houthis used the nearly decade-long war to dramatically expand their military capabilities and cement their highly oppressive control of northern Yemen."

Frank","August 19, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",RESEARCH,"The much anticipated first set of negotiations on the prices of brand-name prescription drugs for the Medicare Part D program has been completed. The 2026 Maximum Fair Prices (MFP) for 10 selected drugs have been established. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) included provisions that enabled the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate the prices for certain prescriptions drugs by amending the “non-interference clause” in Medicare Modernization Act that forbid Medicare from negotiating prescription drug prices. The drugs that were selected for negotiation had to be single source products that would be on the market for 9 years if they were a small molecule product or 13 years if they were a biological product by January 2026 when the MFP takes effect. The drugs selected for negotiation were among the 50 products with the highest level of Part D spending.1
The Act sets out a variety of parameters that govern the first round of negotiations. One key feature is that the Act establishes an upper limit that the negotiation can take in arriving at the MFP that would become the transaction price in 2026. That upper limit is defined as a percentage of the non-federal average manufacturer (NFAMP) prices.2 For selected drugs that have been approved less than 16 years earlier, that upper limit is equal to 75% of the NFAMP. For those more than 16 years post FDA approval the upper limit is 40% of the NFAMP.3
On August 29, 2023, the Department of Health and Human Services announced the 10 drugs selected for negotiations. Table 1 lists the selected drugs, the year they were approved, the conditions they treat, the number of Medicare enrollees in Part D using each drug, and the gross Part D spending during calendar year 2023. Note that in 2026 no drug will have been approved for marketing less than 11 years and one will be 28 years post approval. The Table shows that those drugs account for nearly $50.5 billion in gross Part D drug spending and were purchased on behalf of 9.7 million Medicare beneficiaries."

46,"The US, Canada, and Mexico need a more coordinated approach to their trade relationships with China",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-us-canada-and-mexico-need-a-more-coordinated-approach-to-their-trade-relationships-with-china/,Joshua P. Meltzer,"June 7, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Introduction
As the U.S. tightens trade and investment restrictions with respect to China and invests in developing critical sectors such as semiconductors, electric vehicles (EVs), and clean energy, deeper cooperation between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico under the United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is needed. The USMCA gives businesses and traders certainty about the economic relationship between the three countries, and the long history of their cooperation should make North America the key economic platform for a more competitive and dynamic economy that is best placed to reduce exposure to Chinese supply chains and compete globally. However, in order for this to happen, USMCA countries need to work together to address the gaps that have opened between U.S. trade and investment restrictions on China and Mexico and Canada’s trade and investment settings. Going forward, the U.S. should coordinate more closely with Canada and Mexico on any new trade and investment restrictions applied to China. The fact is that for the U.S. to effectively de-risk its economic relationship with China, a more coordinated North America approach is required. Failure to build a cohesive North American approach will likely lead to the U.S. adopting a more go-it-alone, less effective approach when it comes to China, and would be a missed opportunity to further strengthen North American economic relations.
The economic importance of North America
Trade and investment across North America underpinned by the USMCA is the most important economic relationship for the US, Mexico and Canada. Over $1.8 trillion dollars in annual trade happens between these three countries, accounting for approximately 17 million jobs. Around 75% of Canada’s exports and 78% of Mexico’s exports are to the U.S., and around 33% of U.S. exports go to Canada and Mexico. As a result, North America is a geography of deeply interconnected supply chains, particularly in automotive, but also medical equipment, IT products, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and more.
De-risking the US economic relationship with China
The U.S. goal of reducing its economic interdependence with China—so-called de-risking—is a key focus for the U.S. that will likely only intensify. To this end, the U.S. has adopted a range of trade and investment restrictions on China. These include tightened inbound investment screening, new requirements on U.S. investors to notify the U.S. Treasury Department about investment into China into particular sectors, export controls that include restrictions on access to U.S. technology used to produce high-end semiconductors, and tariffs. Recently, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) completed its Section 301 review of the U.S.-China tariffs which led the Biden administration to increase tariffs on $18 billion of imports from China, which included increased tariffs on semiconductors, 100% tariffs on EVs, and higher tariffs on EV batteries, to name a few.
A new North American approach to China?
While the U.S. has been working to restrict trade and investment with China, Canada and Mexico have not taken similar measures. For instance, Mexico does not have an inbound investment screening regime and Canadian and Mexican tariffs on Chinese imports are in many cases significantly lower than U.S. tariffs. These differences in trade policy toward China is increasingly in tension—economically and politically—with the very open trade economic relationship under USMCA. The central issue is that U.S. action to reduce Chinese access to its markets and technologies can be undermined should China increase trade and investment with Mexico and Canada in order to enter the U.S. market while avoiding U.S. trade and investment restrictions. For example, exports from Mexico of EVs from facilities owned by Chinese EV maker BYD could enter the U.S. under USMCA and pay zero tariffs if it meets the agreement’s rules of origin, regional steel and wage rate requirements, and could also benefit from the $7500 IRA tax credit for EVs assembled in North America. Alternatively, BYD could still export EVs to the U.S. from Mexico and pay the WTO MFN rate of 2.5% for automotive imports, compared to the 100% tariff rate the U.S. would apply to imports of EVs directly from China.
Developing a North American EV sector should be the goal for all USMCA parties, leveraging  the already deep automotive supply chains. For instance, in 2022, over 50% of Mexico’s imports of parts and accessories for motor vehicles came from the U.S. Accelerating the mining of critical minerals in Canada and Mexico, expanding refining capacity, and building battery manufacturing will also be needed.
Yet to ensure that the U.S. continues to see EVs (as one example) as an industry that should be built out across North America, gaps in economic policy toward China between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico need to be addressed. In the case of EVs, this could include Mexico adopting an inbound investment screening regime and Mexico and Canada adopting tariffs similar to the U.S.’s on EVs from China."
47,Ukraine urgently needs support to defend democracy,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/ukraine-urgently-needs-support-to-defend-democracy/,"Jonathan Katz, Lily Conway, Norman Eisen, Robin J. Lewis, Andrii Borovyk, Josh Rudolph","April 19, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"The unconscionable attack on Israel last weekend by Iran and its proxies is the latest example of the grave threats and actions carried out by authoritarian regimes and their close partners globally, including Russia. For far too long, these autocratic actors have openly sought to destabilize democracies and commit brutal acts of aggression. This is a dangerous moment. Autocrats are waiting to see how the U.S., allies, and the international community respond to confrontation, increased violence, and mounting threats.
This includes taking next steps to respond to Putin’s continued war of aggression against Ukraine. This requires immediate attention, renewed leadership, and action from the U.S. and allies globally to deter Russia. Ukrainians face daily aggression and brutality from Russia. Over the past two years, Ukrainian citizens have been the targets of deadly, unrelenting attacks, including thousands of drone and missile strikes. To make matters worse, U.S. assistance that is badly needed for Ukraine’s defense against Russia has been deliberately stalled in the House of Representatives for months. The House of Representatives’ impasse must end, and Ukraine given the critical bipartisan U.S. support it needs to obtain weapons and supplies to defend its cities, citizens, and territorial integrity from more attacks and atrocities. While we lament the unnecessary and costly delay in support to Ukraine, we are encouraged that a vote on assistance for Ukrainians and other U.S. partners in the House of Representatives could happen this week.
Despite these challenges, Ukrainians continue to fight on every front. This includes the fight against corruption, which despite all the other adversity Ukraine is facing, remains absolutely essential if there is to be a secure, democratic future for Ukrainians. In this essay, we discuss how to continue to push forward on the battle for Ukraine’s democracy and fight against corruption while simultaneously dealing with the other multiple challenges that Ukraine is facing on the battlefront.
The two-year anniversary of Russia’s unjust, full-scale invasion of Ukraine has come and gone, and Vladimir Putin continues his indiscriminate, deadly attacks against Ukrainians. These include war crimes against children and civilians across several towns and cities, such as Kyiv and Odessa. Russia also continues to attack Ukraine’s infrastructure and energy system, most recently the Trypilska plant. Ukrainian frontlines are facing increased pressure as munitions dwindle. There is not a moment to lose: The U.S. and the international community must bolster critical support for Ukraine right now in order to defend democracy, human rights, and security in Ukraine and uphold the free world order that the U.S. and allies built after World War II.
Russia has yet to be held fully accountable for its barbaric war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and human rights violations. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has taken a couple of steps in the right direction. It charged Russian military officials for targeting civilians and destroying critical infrastructure. This is on top of the March 2023 ICC arrest warrants for Putin and so-called Children’s Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova for the abduction of Ukrainian children. The weaponization of conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence is only one example of the unconscionable tactics employed by Russian officials. An emboldened Putin has no reason to change his tactics. The operations underway in occupied Ukrainian territories would likely be repeated across all of Ukraine if Russia is not stopped. The stakes could not be higher, as underscored by the growing body of evidence of Russia committing genocide against Ukrainians.
To nobody’s surprise, Russia’s goal to destroy Ukraine and its future as a strong, consolidated democracy has not changed. Autocrat Putin, after Russia’s faux election, feels confident he has sufficiently suppressed the Russian opposition and believes he is winning the war against Ukraine and against democracies globally. With the death of Russian opposition figure and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny, Kremlin threats of nuclear warfare, and ominous meddling in Moldova’s internal affairs, the world has seen how brutally Putin will retaliate against any threat—perceived or otherwise—against his autocratic tyranny. Sadly, there are some, including in the U.S., who continue to praise Putin as a genius rather than recognize him as a cold-blooded murderer.
Ukraine’s future is on the line, but Ukrainians remain resolute in countering Russian aggression, advancing their democratic transformation (including combating corruption), and aspiration to join the EU and NATO. Despite progress on these three goals, Ukraine is at a tipping point. Critical military support and resources urgently needed for Ukraine’s defense continue to be deliberately withheld—including in the U.S. Congress. Ukraine is looking toward the U.S. for economic aid and to advocate for its acceptance into NATO. Timelines are shortening and congressional lawmakers must address the growing distress in Ukraine, including concerns about Ukrainian frontlines collapsing.
President Biden in his State of the Union address last month was right to use this bully pulpit to be clear about the importance of U.S. leadership in standing up to Putin and to push for immediate security assistance for Ukraine. If the raised possibility of congressional action to support Ukraine does not materialize this weekend, the consequences and threats to U.S. national security and that of our allies and partners will only grow.
Putin has already proven through destruction, interference, and corruption sown globally that Russia’s plans lie far beyond Ukraine. Putin sees NATO, and the West at large, as an existential threat that must be countered. There are considerable worries that the war will expand to other countries beyond Ukraine such as Moldova, Poland, or the Baltic states in a larger strategy to recreate the Russian Empire.
Undergirding these roadblocks in Washington and elsewhere is a malicious and unrelenting campaign of disinformation and obfuscation pushed by Putin and at times by enablers in the U.S. Using social media platforms, Russia is fueling internal domestic conflicts, already interfering in the 2024 U.S. election, and amplifying anti-West messaging around the world—perpetrating lies about Ukraine. After a horrific attack in a Moscow concert hall left over 100 people dead, Putin, instead of being honest with Russians, implicated Ukraine even though ISIS claimed responsibility. Furthermore, despite disinformation being debunked numerous times, statements referring to Ukraine as “one of the most corrupt countries in the world” and other similar claims continue. Kremlin propaganda impacts U.S. policymakers and public sentiment, including explicitly seeking to undermine continued assistance packages for Ukraine. Although a majority of Americans favor sending Ukraine military and economic support, the margins are thin, and there is a deep partisan divide."
48,"Russia, Ukraine, and organized crime and illicit economies in 2024",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/russia-ukraine-and-organized-crime-and-illicit-economies-in-2024/,"Vanda Felbab-Brown, Diana Paz García","February 6, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has significantly affected regional illicit economies and criminal networks, but the basic power balance between the Russian state and organized criminal groups has not changed. Due to its direct involvement in illicit economies, the Russian state has remained in a dominant position vis-à-vis criminal groups even as Western sanctions have prompted the emergence of new trafficking routes to supply the industrial and consumer goods that are subject to Western sanctions. This balance of power between the state and crime is likely to continue in 2024, even as Russian citizens’ security starts deteriorating.
In contrast, in Ukraine, Russia’s aggression significantly severed long-established cooperation between Russian and Ukrainian criminal networks. Yet to be seen in 2024 and 2025 is whether Ukrainian criminal groups’ split from their former Russian organized crime partners will persist despite the strong possibility that Ukrainian forces will face increasing attrition in the second half of the year, especially if Western aid falters and dries up.
Relations between Russian and Ukrainian criminal networks
Over the past three decades, Ukrainian organized crime, intensely intermingled with Ukrainian politics and business, was also closely connected to Russian criminal networks. Ukrainian criminal groups were not as tight with their Russian counterparts as the Belarusian crime networks are, but the collaboration was robust enough for Russian intelligence and special forces to use Ukrainian organized crime in support of Russia’s annexation of Crimea and in the separatist region of Donetsk.
Thus, when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, it was uncertain whether Ukrainian criminal networks would sustain their Russian connections or side with Ukraine. Although some Ukrainian criminal groups, such as in Odesa, still provided services to Russian agents, most have severed those ties.
In preparing for the invasion, Russia did not try to line up Ukrainian criminal networks, thinking it would win quickly, Western law enforcement officials told Vanda Felbab-Brown in 2022 and 2023.
The Ukrainian organized groups’ calculations went beyond patriotism: According to Felbab-Brown’s conversations with actors on the ground in Ukraine, experts on Ukrainian organized crime, and Western law enforcement officials, various Ukrainian criminal groups judged that if Russia succeeded in annexing Ukraine, Russian organized crime would eventually subsume or eliminate them. Siding with Ukraine meant preserving some illicit profits and power.
Ukrainian authorities’ early actions reinforced this calculus: First, Ukrainian counterintelligence networks, bolstered by a decade of Western assistance, have systematically and aggressively sought to identify and punish collaborators, including in the criminal underworld.
Second, various Ukrainian politicians and businessmen with criminal entanglements were at least temporarily forgiven if they supported anti-invasion efforts, such as by supplying weapons and ammunition to Ukrainian forces, profiteering along the way. This and broader corruption in Ukrainian procurement, resulting in weapons supply gaps, have created legitimacy problems internally within Ukraine. Ominously, perceptions of corruption could further jeopardize the already-precarious Western military support.
There are also fears that the weapons meant for and being used within Ukraine could leak into European crime markets, but the extent so far has been limited.
Will Ukrainian criminal groups’ pro-Ukraine alignment start changing in 2024? A decline in Western materiel and training support would bring Ukraine to a dangerous military attrition within several months, a trend potentially intensifying in 2025 should Donald Trump win the U.S. presidential election and European right-wing political parties gain momentum. Some Ukrainian organized criminal groups may start determining that defecting and collaborating with Russian actors now may position them better in the long term as battlefield dynamics shift.
Monitoring the criminal landscape and dismantling and arresting any elements of Ukrainian criminal networks developing relations with Russia will be important for maintaining deterrence.
Kremlin-linked sanctions evasion
Following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, a second key question was whether Western sanctions would trigger the Russian state to become so dependent on criminal networks for liquidity and crucial goods that Moscow would lose its dominance over organized crime. While a complete meltdown of the Russian state à la the 1990s, when Russian mafia dons-cum-businessmen often dictated terms to Russian officials, was unlikely, a substantial weakening of the Russian state vis-à-vis organized crime was possible.
That did not happen because the Russian state itself handled the sanctions evasion and smuggling of critical goods. The Russian corporate sector managed hydrocarbon sales, since many governments, such as India and Brazil, embraced Russian energy discounts despite Western sanctions. Linking up with North Korea, Iran, and China, Russian special operations and intelligence services established weapons, microchips, and other critical goods pipelines.
North Korea’s mafia government, which operates the country’s illicit economies, has been an important smuggler of weapons into Russia, including artillery shells and missiles. North Korea’s Rason port and Russia-linked rail saw a dramatic surge in container activity after Russia invaded Ukraine. Beyond diplomatic succor, Russia likely pays North Korea back with military technology blueprints, agricultural commodities, and oil.
Through the Caspian Sea, Iranian smuggling networks have similarly delivered anti-tank missiles, RPGs, attack drones, and artillery shells to Moscow, while the Iran-linked Houthis have avoided targeting Russian ships.
China too has played an essential role in undermining Western sanctions on Russia, particularly in vital industrial components like microchips. Russian electronics smuggling rings, such as the Serniya Network, have also helped Russia overcome Western export bans. Establishing front companies in Western countries as well as developing hubs in China, the United Arab Emirates, and Serbia, these channels have supplied both the Russian military and other Russian companies.
China also receives the majority of Russian oil tankers. With the Greek port of Kalamata and the Spanish city Ceuta also implicated in evading the European Union’s ban on Russian oil, Hong Kong and Dubai have become Russian oil companies’ primary trading capitals.
Dubai is also where sanctioned Russian oligarchs and criminals have parked their physical assets and money. Indian smuggling networks operating in Dubai have helped launder Russia-bound money and gold, such as that extracted by the Kremlin-linked Wagner Group.
Kremlin-linked Russian criminal networks are expanding a “dark fleet” of vessels that obfuscate cargo origin and frequently operate without a flag state, registration number, automatic identification system, and insurance. Alternatively, they use flags of convenience such as Panama, Malta, Libera, and Cameroon.
Various Greek companies, such as Navios Maritime Partners and Eastern Mediterranean Maritime, are being scrutinized for Russia-linked transactions. Greek ships now constitute nearly 50 percent of tanker capacity departing from Russian ports, a 33 percent surge since the invasion.
A Bombay-based company, Gatik Ship, facilitates disguising ship ownership and illicit business. After Saint Kitts and Nevis annulled the registration of 36 Gatik ships for transporting sanctioned Russian oil, at least four were reflagged in Mongolia.
New land smuggling routes through Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Turkey have also emerged. Many of these networks are highly fragmented, decentralized, non-Russian, and independent of the Kremlin. But since they mostly carry consumer goods for the Russian economy, instead of sensitive military and industrial contraband, they do not threaten the Russian state’s power.
Long used to collecting “taxes” from Russian crime networks, Russian intelligence services began extensively facilitating and directing the Russian organized criminal groups’ smuggling of counterfeit and untaxed tobacco, other counterfeit goods, and even drugs to generate hard cash for the state and their own covert operations.
Organized crime within Russia
Acting independently of the Kremlin, some Russian organized criminal groups also smuggle Western consumer goods, from Mercedes parts to cat food. Since Russian law enforcement structures are preoccupied with suppressing protest and tracing anti-war activities, they are paying less attention. In time, competition over these markets could trigger fights among Russian criminal groups, creating some legitimacy and deterrence problems for the Kremlin.
However, by satisfying Russian consumers, this growing smuggling also indirectly reinforces the Kremlin’s grip on power. Besides, Russia has copycatted many Western brands, raking in profits, often with the Kremlin’s direct hand. The Kremlin and Russian elites have been able to cash in on the bonanza.
While former Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin pioneered the recruitment of hardened criminals, including murderers and drug smugglers, from Russian prisons for Wagner’s Ukraine operations, the Russian military has picked up the practice. Those who do not become the war’s cannon fodder will eventually return to Russia, significantly augmenting Russian criminal groups’ coercive power and perhaps their proclivity toward violence. The Kremlin will have a challenge keeping them subservient. And while in the ranks, they risk further criminalizing the already-corruption-ridden Russian military.
Russian cybercrime is getting closer to the Russian state
Since February 2022, Russian government-affiliated groups have accelerated denial-of-service attacks and malware operations against Ukrainian cyber infrastructure. Leading the charge has been the Sandworm Team, closely linked to Russia’s military intelligence service and engaging in cyberattacks against Ukraine since 2015. Sandworm also helped bring down various Ukrainian cities’ power grids, but its cybercrime and espionage operations go far beyond Ukraine.
Importantly, various previously-independent Russian cybercrime groups, such as Wizard Spider, which has conducted ransomware attacks against U.S. health care networks, have aligned themselves with the Russian state and joined attacks against Ukraine.
Drug flows
Although the war in Ukraine redirected some drug routes, cocaine smuggling into Russia did not collapse. In fact, the cocaine supply, intended for distribution into Western Europe, appears to have increased, as Russian criminal networks, assisted by counterparts in Lithuania, Belarus, Serbia, and Turkey, continue to supply cocaine from Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Venezuela. And despite the Taliban’s ban on opium cultivation, the Russian criminal networks’ decades-old smuggling of Afghan heroin into Russia and Europe, some of which is linked to groups in Chechnya and its strongman Ramzan Kadyrov, has not shown any weakening either.
But consistent with the synthetic drugs revolution sweeping the world, amphetamine use is also rising in Russia. Synthetic drug laboratories, many owned by Russian organized crime and relocated to Kazakhstan since 2022, supply members of the Russian military.
Russian crime far away from Russia
Russian smuggling networks have also proliferated in surprising places, such as the U.S.-Mexico border where since mid-2022, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has reported a noticeable increase in Russians attempting to cross into the United States. The messaging platform Telegram offers detailed migration guidance and facilitates connections to smuggling networks. Many of the smuggled individuals are likely escaping the Kremlin’s authoritarianism, but amid the intense Russian intelligence presence in Latin America and especially in Mexico, some could endanger U.S. interests.
Russian intelligence services could also encourage the establishment of greater cooperation between Russian and Mexican criminal groups or attempt to develop direct ties to Mexicans by offering them safe haven in Russia away from the reach of U.S. law enforcement. Should any such ties materialize, the United States should prioritize dismantling any Mexican groups collaborating with Russia.
Overall, in 2024, the prospects are high that the Russian state will maintain its upper hand vis-à-vis Russian organized crime, while Ukrainian organized crime may start posing a multifaceted challenge to Ukraine."

Animated by shared grievances against the configuration of the international order and mutual concerns about perceived external threats, principally from the United States, the Sino-Russian partnership has deepened over the last decade across the military, economic, and diplomatic domains. Beijing and Moscow’s strategic alignment will pose a significant test for the incoming Trump administration.
China and Russia’s strategic alignment and top threats to vital U.S. interests
China’s continued economic and diplomatic support for Russia enables the latter to sustain its war of aggression in Ukraine. This war undermines the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that underpin global stability, threatens the United States’ NATO allies, and risks drawing the United States into a military confrontation in Europe. China has supplied Russia with industrial inputs, many dual use, including microelectronics, military optics, drone and turbojet engines, armored vehicles, satellite technology, and materials like nitrocellulose. These exports have flowed directly through Chinese suppliers and via third countries and have facilitated the reconstitution of Russia’s defense industrial base. China has also undercut efforts to isolate Russia diplomatically. It continues to lend credence to Moscow’s narrative that paints Russia as the victim of Western aggression and NATO expansion as the real driver of the war in Ukraine. As such, Sino-Russian cooperation poses a direct threat to the interests of the United States as well as its European allies and partners.
China and Russia are weakening the underpinnings of American leadership on the world stage and core elements of the existing rules-based international order. Beijing and Moscow are disseminating narratives of terminal U.S. decline across the Global South and developing alternative supply chains and financial institutions to insulate themselves from U.S. sanctions. The two states are determined to end what they see as a U.S.-dominated international order. With the support of the Global South, they are seeking to create an order in which the United States and its Western partners have a diminished role, and authoritarian states are free from international scrutiny and immune to Western sanctions. The Russia-Ukraine war and the escalating crisis in the Middle East, which have sharply divided the United States, its allies, and its partners from much of the rest of the world, have given Beijing and Moscow a boost in advancing such aims.
While China or Russia alone might not present a credible alternate pole, a joint China-Russia “pole” is appealing to middle powers including Turkey, South Africa, Brazil, regimes in the Middle East, and other Global South states who believe that the current international order does not sufficiently account for their voices. This is evidenced by the growing popularity of the BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Hedging by these middle powers creates geopolitical capital for Beijing and Moscow, economic benefits for Moscow in particular, and limits the influence of the United States, its allies, and its partners.
China and Russia’s deepening military alignment poses a challenge to U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific region. China-Russia military interactions, including joint exercises, have increased in frequency over the decades. In recent months, the two countries have held live-fire maritime drills in the South China Sea and joint long-range bomber patrols near Alaska. While cooperation and integration between the People’s Liberation Army and the Russian Armed Forces are still limited, there is considerable potential for deeper integration. These developments complicate strategic planning for the United States, its allies, and its partners given how costly and complex it would be to deter coordinated, if not joint, China and Russian military operations. In addition, China-Russia technological cooperation in the military domain—including Chinese purchases of advanced Russian fighter jets, submarine technologies, and air defense systems; Russian purchases of Chinese semiconductors that power military drones and tanks; and research collaboration in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and space technology—raises significant security concerns for the United States and its partners.
Identifying the challenges and strategic opportunities
China and Russia’s strategic partnership will persist as long as each continues to see the United States as its principal adversary. The United States maintains a significant trust deficit with both Beijing and Moscow which creates challenges for bilateral engagement. Neither Beijing nor Moscow believes that they have anything to gain by working with Washington to check the other’s influence.
The United States is limited in its ability to engineer a Sino-Russian split. Neither Beijing nor Moscow can be wholly co-opted or punished into submission. It would be extremely misguided to try to win over one or both parties through fundamental concessions, such as endorsing China’s claims to Taiwan or recognizing Russia’s occupation of Ukrainian territories. Such appeasement would not only undermine U.S. credibility with its allies and partners but also embolden China, Russia, and other revisionist regimes to engage in further aggression. Neither can Washington inflict punishments that existentially threaten either China or Russia, such as through a military attack or the imposition of a comprehensive economic embargo, without severely threatening U.S. security and economic stability, as well as that of its allies and partners.
Chinese and Russian interests are not fully aligned. While Beijing and Moscow share the aim of eroding Washington’s global influence and its alliance networks, the two states have fundamentally different strategic outlooks. As the world’s second-largest economy and largest trading state, China has a far greater stake than Russia in regional and global stability. China does not ultimately benefit from prolonged conflicts in Europe or the Middle East, even if Beijing tends to view these conflicts as greater problems for the United States than for itself. While some Chinese strategists believe a United States tied down in Europe and the Middle East diverts attention from China, others point out that U.S. pressure on China has continued to mount despite these conflicts and that strategic ties between the U.S. alliance networks in Asia and Europe have actually been strengthened in spite of, or in some cases because of, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
Moscow, on the other hand, has no interest in serving as a junior partner to Beijing and seeks to expand its freedom of strategic maneuver, as evidenced by its outreach to Iran, North Korea, and India, among others. Both capitals fear being drawn into an alignment that could threaten their independent decisionmaking or entrap them in a war that they have no interest in fighting. In fact, such fears contributed to the Sino-Soviet split during the Cold War.
Finally, despite their pronouncement of a “no limits” partnership, mistrust and rivalry run deep in the Sino-Russian relationship. The two states have a long history of conflict, thin cultural and people-to-people ties, and overlapping spheres of influence in Asia, Africa, and the Arctic—all of which limit the depth of their alignment. These tensions could drive them apart over the medium to long term, as they have in earlier iterations of partnership between Beijing and Moscow.
Beijing benefits from its respective bilateral ties with Russia, North Korea, and Iran, but it has no interest in joining or endorsing a four-way “axis.” Beijing is uncomfortable with strengthening Russian-North Korean military cooperation and especially with the entry of North Korean forces into the Ukrainian battlefield. The rise of a more militarily advanced North Korea that is emboldened by a Russian security guarantee directly threatens the stability of China’s immediate neighborhood. Similarly, while China is Iran’s largest trade partner and Beijing has some security cooperation with Tehran, this relationship remains limited. Beijing does not benefit by linking its relationship with Iran to a broader axis.
China’s ties with Russia could potentially serve as an asset (with limits). While falling far short of Ukrainian expectations—and the West’s, more broadly—Beijing has at times used its channels with Moscow to signal its redlines and expectations, such as its opposition to nuclear escalation in Europe. China has also publicly stated that it supports the principles of state sovereignty and territorial integrity that are enshrined in the U.N. Charter. At the appropriate time, Beijing could be pressed to support a negotiated end to the conflict that upholds its stated positions. It could also potentially contribute to Ukraine’s reconstruction and economic recovery should Kyiv seek Chinese participation. For now, however, Ukrainian frustrations with Beijing have mounted given the latter’s consistent support for Russia since its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
Recommendations 
The United States’ key objectives for the China-Russia partnership should be to prevent the further deepening of this relationship and to actively counter Beijing and Moscow’s efforts to undermine U.S. global leadership and support for the rules-based international order. To advance these objectives, the Trump administration should:
Recognize the strategic challenges posed by China and Russia’s partnership as well as their respective ties with Iran and North Korea, without overstating the degree of their alignment and joint coordination. While China and Russia’s partnership runs deep—and the four countries are working to support Russia’s war effort—the “axis” narrative suggests greater solidarity among this grouping than is merited. This clouds strategic analysis and policy creativity, and it enhances the propaganda value of the grouping to the detriment of U.S. interests.
Keep open channels of communication. While the United States may not be able to engineer a Sino-Russian split, it should keep the diplomatic door open so that if and when strains arise in Beijing and Moscow’s relationship, one or both parties will see Washington as a viable option for hedging against the other.
Signal to Beijing that its interests are better served by sharply limiting its support for Russia. China broadly shares an interest in regional and global stability and aspires to be a respected leader in the international system. A mix of strategic and reputational costs, such as the threat of secondary sanctions, as well as diplomatic incentives, should be employed to push Beijing to limit and constructively leverage its ties with Russia. When possible, threats and red lines should be communicated privately to provide Beijing with a face-saving off-ramp to adjust its policies. In addition, public recognition for cooperative behavior should be given when due, such as when China supports sanctions enforcement or takes a public stand against nuclear escalation. It not only provides China with a reputational boost but also makes any changes in Beijing’s policy more obvious and politically costly. The key is that Beijing must believe that there is an upside to cooperating with Washington to curb Russian aggression.
Take the competition for hearts and minds in the Global South seriously. The United States must more vigorously counter the Chinese and Russian charge that it seeks to inhibit the emergence of a more inclusive international order that presents significant economic opportunities and channels for developing countries to shape the rules, norms, and trajectory of the global arena. To that end, the Trump administration should prioritize an affirmative economic agenda in the Global South and reforms to long-standing multilateral institutions that would strengthen support among developing countries."
50,The climate vulnerability gap: Developing a metric to advance racial equity and more just climate investment,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-climate-vulnerability-gap-developing-a-metric-to-advance-racial-equity-and-more-just-climate-investment/,Manann Donoghoe,"October 16, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",RESEARCH,"Earlier this year, we hit a milestone that should get everyone’s attention: July 2024 marked the first full 12-month period in which global temperatures averaged 1.64 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial-era temperatures. For the U.S., the temperature increase has brought a more unstable climate with frequent and increasingly compounding disasters, from hurricanes and flooding to extreme heat.  
While climate change is caused by greenhouse gas emissions warming the atmosphere, many of the growing impacts of climate change are social and economic. For the most vulnerable communities, these alarming impacts aren’t a future problem—they’re being felt now, and innovative policy is desperately needed to ensure that they do not undermine progress in social and racial justice. To develop effective climate adaptation policy, including targeting investments to the communities that need them most, policymakers—both lawmakers and executives—need empirical tools to understand the distribution of climate risks, vulnerability, and resilience by race, ethnicity, and place. 
But national, state, and local policymakers, while broadly aware of the need for adaptation in vulnerable communities, lack the information to make the most informed choices, especially about opportunities for alignment: how and where to invest scarce public resources in ways that can reduce climate vulnerabilities while furthering racial equity and economic mobility. While tools do exist to identify vulnerable groups and communities, none communicate climate action as a tool for racial justice. New empirical tools are needed for local governance that can expand how climate action is communicated for a variety of racial groups. This includes highlighting the role that disasters, heatwaves, and other climate-related risks play in amplifying barriers to racial progress, and illustrating how policymakers can align investments in climate action with goals for inclusive economic development. 
Tracking racial gaps in climate vulnerability and resilience could help do this. Put simply, “vulnerability” refers to the exposure and sensitivity of communities and households to risks before an extreme event occurs. Social factors such as low household wealth and income, and environmental ones such as aging housing, can make households more vulnerable to disasters and climate extremes. “Resilience,” meanwhile, refers to the capacity of a community, infrastructure, or individual to prepare for, cope with, and recover from an extreme event. Measuring racial gaps in both could provide another policy tool to assess racial progress alongside other metrics.  
To help meet this challenge, this report explores a new concept: “the climate vulnerability gap,” an empirical tool to gauge racial progress in climate policy and action. The report explores this concept by linking the U.S. Climate Vulnerability Index, created by the Environmental Defense Fund and Texas A&M University, with Census Bureau demographic data from the American Community Survey. The preliminary evidence in this report shows:  
Significant gaps in climate vulnerability by race and ethnicity exist, including at the national, regional, state, and city levels, regardless of regional differences in hazards or the demographic makeup of places. While this is a relative measure of vulnerability, the gaps are substantial, indicating an increased likelihood that extreme weather will generate financial distress, loss of assets, or dangerous health impacts in those communities.  
Rather than exposure to extreme climate events, these gaps are driven primarily by racial differences in underlying social vulnerability, such as health risks and housing insecurity—indicating the large role that these factors play in amplifying climate risk for nonwhite communities.  
Despite the race-based gaps in vulnerability, they are averages only; there are also many Black- and/or Latino or Hispanic-majority cities and towns (meaning that residents identifying as Black or Latino or Hispanic alone or in combination represent the majority demographic) where climate vulnerability is lower than the regional average. These relatively less vulnerable communities are spread across the U.S., but are concentrated in Washington, D.C., Virginia, Maryland, Michigan, and Northern California. 
The remainder of this report presents these findings in more detail and demonstrates the potential benefits of adopting intersectional measures of climate impacts and risks such as this, including helping inform local and state planning for adaptation and resilience.   "

55,"What is deterrence, and what is its role in U.S. national defense?",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-is-deterrence-and-what-is-its-role-in-u-s-national-defense/,Melanie W. Sisson,"May 1, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"It may come as a surprise to many Americans that the mission of the United States Department of Defense (DOD) is not “To fight and win the nation’s wars.” It is, instead, “to provide the military forces needed to deter war and ensure our nation’s security.” Although it is a sentence shorter than some coffee orders at Starbucks, this statement captures important ideas about what causes war, what prevents it, and therefore what the DOD needs to be able to do to protect the people and prosperity of the United States.
What does it mean to deter?
The idea of deterrence is the central feature of the DOD mission statement. Deterrence is a very common-sense proposition. It starts with the observation that costs and benefits affect how people make decisions about whether to behave in certain ways. In general, history leads us to believe that people take action when the benefits of doing so are higher than the costs and do not take action when that math is reversed. The implication is that raising the costs or lowering the benefits another actor can expect from a particular behavior will make them less likely to do it—that it will deter them.
This is a simple insight in theory, but it is difficult to do in practice. Attempts to deter always can, and often do, fail. To have a good chance at being effective, deterrence requires having some knowledge of what costs and benefits the other actor cares about. The likelihood of deterring effectively also depends upon the ability to communicate to the other actor that if they behave in a particular way then they will have to pay those costs, or that they will lose those benefits.
What does the DOD try to deter?
The deterrence job of the Department of Defense is to try to convince other actors, usually countries but also non-state actors like terrorist organizations, that they will suffer more than they will gain if they go to war with the United States or its treaty allies. It seeks to deter attacks with nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, often called weapons of mass destruction, and attacks with conventional weapons like bullets, explosives, or fire-producing bombs and missiles. The U.S. military is often one element of larger government efforts to deter other kinds of unwanted behavior, usually actions policymakers believe threaten America’s most important, or vital, national interests or that violate international law. The United States Armed Forces have been involved, for example, in efforts to deter the harassment of ships operating legally at sea, to deter unauthorized tests of nuclear capabilities, and to deter governments from using violence against their own populations.
How does the DOD try to deter war?
The DOD’s priority mission is always to deter other countries from waging war against the United States. To achieve this, the DOD works to convince all potential adversaries that going to war with the United States will cost them far more than they stand to gain.
Since 1945, the Department of Defense has sought to deter war in three ways. The first is through the size and quality of conventional U.S. military forces—the equipment and operational skill of its all-volunteer Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. The DOD determines the necessary size, composition, and locations of these forces based on its assessment of the types, sources, and likelihoods of potential threats to the territory and people of the United States. These assessments include consideration of the second means through which the United States seeks to deter war: its defense alliances with other countries.
U.S. defense alliances are treaty-based commitments that the United States enters into to confirm that it will come to the aid of another country if that country is attacked. In some alliances, that guarantee works in both directions. In others, the United States does not necessarily expect direct military assistance but instead asks the ally to cooperate on other policies that contribute to U.S. national security. In this way, U.S. defense alliances are intended to increase the opposing force a potential adversary must expect to face if it chooses to attack either a U.S. ally or the United States itself. The United States entered into the alliances it has today after learning from the experiences of World War I, World War II, and other conflicts that wars even in distant parts of the world harm the U.S. economy and can threaten the American way of life.
The conventional military capabilities and defense alliances the United States uses to try to deter war are accompanied—or, as it is sometimes said, are “backstopped” —by its arsenal of around 5,000 nuclear weapons.1 The United States makes clear in its policies that its nuclear weapons exist because they are necessary to deter any other actor’s use of a nuclear weapon on the territory of the United States or of its allies. During some periods of history, U.S. policymakers concluded that nuclear weapons also were necessary to deter conventional war. This was the case for some of the 50 years of the United States’ Cold War with the Soviet Union, which had very large conventional forces in positions that were directly threatening to America’s North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies in Europe. After the end of the Cold War in 1991, the United States enjoyed such a clear, global, conventional military advantage that some policymakers believed nuclear threats were not necessary to deter conventional war. All possible adversaries, of course, were also still well aware of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.
Does the DOD have what it needs to try to deter war?
There is disagreement within the U.S. national security community about what conventional forces, defense alliances, and nuclear weapons are needed to try to deter war in what the DOD calls today’s era of great power competition with China and Russia. Some policymakers and analysts think that the most effective way to try to deter China and Russia, and also the smaller but still threatening countries of Iran and North Korea, is for the United States, together with its defense treaty allies, to have clear conventional military superiority. They argue that if the leaders of these states see that they cannot win a war against the United States, then they won’t start one.
This group recommends making substantial investments of taxpayer money in the DOD budget so that it can achieve superiority by buying conventional weapons and other modern warfighting systems. Some believe that nuclear superiority already is, or soon might become, equally necessary, and therefore also recommend increased spending on the infrastructure that maintains the current U.S. nuclear arsenal and that would be used to produce new weapons, if policymakers were to decide to do so. Many who take this view argue that the Biden administration’s request of $875 billion to fund both the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy’s (DOE) nuclear activities in fiscal year 2025 is inadequate to achieve lasting military superiority.
Others, however, do not think it is wise to try to achieve clear military superiority over China. They argue that if such a war were to happen, it would almost certainly be far away from the continental United States, in the seas of East Asia. The U.S. military would be challenged not only by China’s military, which is growing in size and sophistication, but also by distance and the difficulties of operating in an ocean environment. This group warns that attempting to achieve superiority would therefore be immensely expensive and still might not achieve the goal of persuading China that it would lose a war with the United States and its allies. Instead, these analysts recommend that the United States and its allies try to deter China by convincing it that a decision to go to war would be enormously militarily and economically costly and undermine the status, standing, and influence that China has with many countries in the world.
How have Trump and Biden tried to deter war?
During their terms in office, both President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden demonstrated that they think U.S. conventional and nuclear military capabilities are necessary to try to deter war. Both presidents requested annual increases in the DOD conventional and DOE nuclear budgets, which together grew from roughly $650 billion in 2018 to roughly $875 billion in 2024.
Trump and Biden, however, took sharply different approaches to U.S. defense alliances. The Biden administration emphasized that there is great value in the role U.S. defense alliances play in trying to deter war—that the money and effort the United States spends to have defense alliances is worth it. Biden worked to show that U.S. defense alliances are not only militarily strong but that they also will team together to use other tools of national power—like economic sanctions, defense equipment transfers, trade policies, and diplomatic actions in international institutions like the United Nations—to impose consequences if states choose to pursue their goals through war. This is what the United States, its NATO allies, and other partners have done to Russia since it invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
During his term as president, and now as a presidential candidate, Trump has expressed doubt about whether U.S. defense alliances make important contributions to deterring war or support U.S. national security. He believes that America’s allies have not invested enough in their own defense and instead are free-riding and taking advantage of the larger and more capable U.S. military. Trump has repeatedly suggested that because of this he might withdraw from more than one of America’s defense alliances or simply not honor their terms.
Breaking U.S. defense alliances would mean that the DOD’s mission would be to deter attacks only against the United States. This would change how and where the U.S. military operates. It is very likely that if the United States leaves its defense alliances, then many European countries, Japan, South Korea, and others will try to deter attacks on their territories by increasing their conventional militaries. They might also seek to get nuclear weapons if they don’t already have them and to increase their nuclear arsenals if they do. If U.S. defense alliances do influence how leaders in Russia, China, and elsewhere calculate what they stand to gain or lose through war, then the absence of U.S. defense alliances might also make these states more likely to try to achieve their goals through the use of force.
The decision that American presidents make about how to try to deter war is therefore a very serious one. It can affect how U.S. taxpayer dollars are spent, it can affect the size of other countries’ militaries, and it can affect the number of nuclear weapons in the world. Biden and Trump have very different views on how to try to deter wars that can harm the people and prosperity of the United States. These differences mean that America’s allies, and its potential adversaries, will be watching the outcome of November’s election with great interest."
56,"Trump has big plans for climate and energy policy, but can he implement them?",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trump-has-big-plans-for-climate-and-energy-policy-but-can-he-implement-them/,"Samantha Gross, Louison Sall","July 30, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Donald Trump has made clear in his campaign that he supports a significant shift in U.S. energy policy, characterized by a robust emphasis on fossil fuels, extensive regulatory rollbacks, and a scaling back of renewable energy policies. He justifies these changes as necessary to reduce energy costs, achieve “energy dominance,” and boost the competitiveness of U.S. industries by removing the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change and removing regulations on drilling for oil and gas.
Trump does a great deal of posturing on deregulating drilling, rolling back electric vehicles, stopping energy-based inflation, and energy independence, but his results in achieving this agenda will be mixed. Several of Trump’s oft-repeated statements about U.S. energy just aren’t true, including his boasts about the size of U.S. energy resources and his complaints about energy’s contribution to inflation. Additionally, a future Trump administration could not accomplish all of his energy-related objectives alone. Many of these goals would require actions from Congress, whose composition is up in the air until the election. The previous Trump administration’s track record on changing energy and environment policy was spotty at best, although he would likely bring in more experienced staff who are more capable of implementing his deregulatory agenda in a second term. Indeed, a rightward shift in the federal courts and several recent Supreme Court decisions make Trump’s deregulatory agenda easier to achieve.
Trump strongly supports the US fossil fuel industry
Trump’s campaign has consistently emphasized a “return” to fossil fuel dominance. The United States became the world’s largest oil producer in 2018, during Trump’s term as president, and has remained in that spot ever since. In fact, since that time, the United States has produced more oil than any country before, ever. This growth in production had little to do with either president’s policies and was instead the result of applying new technologies in increasingly productive ways. The United States is also the world’s largest natural gas producer, ahead of the next largest, Russia, by more than 40%. One could argue that the United States is already a dominant force in the global supply of fossil fuels.
On the campaign trail, in the Republican Party’s platform, and in his acceptance speech at the 2024 Republican National Convention, Trump claims that the United States has the largest oil reserves of any country. Despite the dominant U.S. role in production today, this statement is far from true. U.S. oil reserves rank somewhere between ninth and 11th, depending on whom you ask. (Estimating reserves is an inexact science and methodologies differ.) The United States ranks fourth or fifth in the world in natural gas reserves. These reserve levels are nothing to sneeze at, and innovation in production techniques and deep capital markets have made the United States the strong producer it is today. Nonetheless, we are not sitting on the world’s largest reserves of “liquid gold.”
Some of Trump’s specific proposals include increasing domestic production and refilling the strategic petroleum reserve. Trump plans to end President Joe Biden’s delays of federal drilling permits and leases on federal lands to boost oil and natural gas production. This includes removing red tape and speeding up the approval of natural gas pipelines. After what he describes as Biden’s “wasteful” depletion of the strategic petroleum reserve, Trump intends to refill it to ensure energy security.
Trump opposes most clean energy policies
Trump has expressed strong opposition to several renewable energy initiatives, claiming that renewable energy is unreliable and costly. He describes Biden’s electricity policies as “industry-killing, jobs-killing, pro-China and anti-American.”
Wind and solar: Trump has made statements during his campaign criticizing wind and solar energy as being too expensive for too little output. He is especially opposed to wind power and has promised to halt offshore wind development, which he claims harms marine life.
Electric vehicles: Trump’s campaign officially opposes Biden’s electric vehicle subsidies and vehicle efficiency rules, arguing that they are detrimental to the auto industry and that electric vehicles are “all made in China” (not true). He promises to repeal these policies to protect American auto workers and the traditional car market.
Abolishing energy efficiency standards: His administration made promises to eliminate energy efficiency standards for appliances, claiming that they result in inferior product choices for consumers.
Nuclear power: Trump’s position on nuclear power is similar to that of the Biden administration; he supports keeping existing nuclear reactors operating and continuing the development of small modular reactors.
Trump sees regulation and international agreements as hindering energy production and driving inflation
A significant part of Trump’s energy policy involves rescinding regulations he believes hinder the energy sector, with a focus on energy security rather than climate change. He claims that Biden has waged a “war on American energy,” and blames Biden for rising energy costs and inflation.
While rising prices for energy and other commodities were an important factor in inflation, other significant drivers included persistent supply chain disruptions that increased the cost of goods and services and a tight U.S. labor market. It’s true that fuel costs were very low at the end of the Trump administration, but those low costs were a result of the global economic shutdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the results of climate change (such as wildfires), volatile fossil fuel costs, and decaying energy infrastructure are driving increased electricity costs in many areas, rather than policies to increase renewable electricity penetration.
Trump claims that aggressive drilling policies could reduce energy costs by 50%. “Drill, baby, drill” is a frequent theme in his speeches. No matter the level of drilling, however, U.S. producers and their international counterparts would be very unlikely to accept such a price drop—producers everywhere slow down their output when depressed prices harm their profitability. Oil is priced in the international market and U.S. actions alone will not have such a large impact on prices.
Trump intends to once again withdraw from the Paris Agreement, describing it in his June 28 debate with Biden as “a rip-off of the United States” and “a disaster.” Unofficial sources say there is talk of also withdrawing the United States from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a move that would remove the United States from participation in global climate negotiations and make it more difficult for a future administration to rejoin the Paris Agreement. It’s unclear legally whether the president alone can remove the United States from a Senate-approved treaty, but rejoining would certainly require a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate, a high hurdle in a closely-divided body.
Biden-era climate and energy laws are likely to remain in place
The first Trump administration was focused on deregulation in many areas, particularly supporting the fossil fuel industry through reducing environmental and climate regulations. The Trump administration’s success in its deregulatory efforts was mixed. On the one hand, the previous Obama administration’s climate efforts were pursued through regulation under existing laws, rather than new legislation, meaning that the Trump administration could change them without involving Congress. On the other hand, the Trump administration often cut corners in the process of deregulation, meaning they frequently lost when their changes were challenged in court.
A second Trump administration faces a different landscape in curtailing climate and environmental policy. Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which represent historic investments in the United States’ infrastructure and energy sectors. The IIJA allocated substantial funding to rebuilding roads, bridges, and railways and investing in the transportation system, enhanced broadband access, water infrastructure, and upgrades to the power grid. The IRA is the largest climate-and-energy-related investment in U.S. history, allocating an estimated $369 billion toward clean energy and renewable production, emissions reduction, and tax incentives for individuals and families to make energy-efficient improvements.
The IIJA and IRA are laws that Congress passed, not agency interpretations of existing laws. Thus, changing or repealing them, completely or in part, would require action from Congress. Given that many of the investments funded by these two laws are taking place in areas represented by Republicans, majorities in Congress might not support Trump’s desired changes. This depends on the outcome of the election, and a strongly Republican Congress would change this assumption. But an evenly divided Congress would be unlikely to repeal either law.
A second Trump administration could be more effective at changing regulation than the first
Clearly, Trump envisions a very different energy future than Biden—and the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, as well—with much greater emphasis on fossil fuels and scaling-back regulations that encourage renewable energy and electric vehicle deployment. A second Trump administration would likely succeed in changing key regulations, which the executive branch can accomplish on its own, such as weakening vehicle and appliance efficiency standards and changing the tax and leasing schemes for fossil fuel development on public lands. Additionally, a Trump administration could slow-walk or weaken the implementation of the IIJA and IRA to better achieve its political ends. More experienced staff and courts inclined to agree with his policies can make these changes happen.
On the personnel side, the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, an agenda for the next Republican administration is intended to provide “conservative policy recommendations and properly vetted and trained personnel to implement them.” Although Trump has publicly distanced himself from Project 2025 (and its policy recommendations are not included in this post), the effort involved more than 140 people who worked in his administration, including six cabinet secretaries. With such a process to identify experienced and loyal officials, a second Trump administration is likely to be more skillful at operating the levers of government than the first, making regulatory rollbacks more likely to be successful.
In the judiciary, efforts to roll back regulations in the energy sector could be significantly impacted by several recent Supreme Court decisions on administrative law. Receiving the most attention is the decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimundo to overturn the policy known as Chevron deference (after the 1984 case Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council). The new ruling asserts that judges should be responsible for determining the “best reading” of ambiguous statutes, rather than relying on agency interpretation as decided in the Chevron case 40 years ago. Other key decisions this term:
Removed the six-year statute of limitations for suing the federal government for a regulatory action (Corner Post Inc. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System).
Stayed an air quality rule because the Environmental Protection Agency hadn’t adequately responded to comments from affected parties (Ohio v. EPA).
Required the Securities and Exchange Commission to try cases involving civil penalties in federal court, rather than in a Securities and Exchange Commission administrative court (SEC v. Jarkesy).
Additionally, the West Virginia v. EPA decision from two years ago said that any issue with major economic or political consequences requires explicit congressional authorization in law, the new “major questions doctrine.”
Taken together, these cases demonstrate the Supreme Court’s skepticism about the administrative state and its willingness to take more power for itself. The courts now decide how technical laws should be interpreted, whether responses to technical comments are adequate, or what constitutes a “major question.” Environmental laws are often written somewhat ambiguously, to allow regulatory agencies to use their authority to respond to new challenges and new abatement techniques and technologies. Since lawmakers can’t predict future challenges, legislating for the future often involves a certain level of ambiguity, setting goals broadly rather than narrowly when they write legislation.
In a potential Trump administration that favors deregulation and with a conservative majority in the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts, this ambiguity in laws may prove to be an advantage and make challenges to existing regulations much more likely to succeed."
57,Russia’s disruptive actions show that European and Asian security cannot be decoupled,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/russias-disruptive-actions-show-that-european-and-asian-security-cannot-be-decoupled/,Angela Stent,"July 15, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"As NATO celebrated its 75th anniversary in Washington, it faced a Russia that continues its brutal aggression against Ukraine, is waging hybrid warfare against Europe, is working hard to turn the non-Western world against the West, and is now developing a new Asia strategy.
China is the anchor of Vladimir Putin’s Asia strategy. Since China stepped in to support Russia after the annexation of Crimea and the outbreak of the war in the Donbas in 2014, Moscow has become increasingly reliant on Beijing. This dependence has grown since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. China has reiterated the Russian narrative blaming NATO for the outbreak of the war and, through its exports of goods that contribute to Russia’s military-industrial base, it enables Russia to continue the war.
China is not only Russia’s lifeline in this conflict but both countries are allied in calling for a multipolar “post-Western” world that will move away from U.S. domination. They seek to build an axis of authoritarians that appeals to a receptive group of countries in the Global South. China is Russia’s top trading partner, although it is much more important for Russia economically than vice versa. Putin benefits from the reality that Xi Jinping does not want Russia to lose the war, because he fears that a post-Putin Russia could be run by a leader who might reconsider Russia’s antagonistic relationship with the West and would improve ties with the United States and Europe—to China’s detriment.
The increasingly close relationship between Moscow and Beijing—despite its asymmetries and differences of interest between the two powers—represents a danger to NATO because it strengthens Russia’s ability to continue its aggression in Ukraine, further threatening European security.
A new axis of resistance
Putin has, in the past two years, created an “axis of resistance” of countries that facilitate his aggression—China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. Iran provides drones that Russia uses in Ukraine, and Moscow appears to be supplying Tehran with advanced weapons, probably accepting that Iran will become a nuclear weapons state. Iranian support of Hamas and Hezbollah destabilizes the Middle East and also threatens NATO countries since its actions could lead to a wider war with the West.
Putin’s recent visit to Pyongyang showcased North Korea’s growing role in his pivot to Asia and the two countries’ increasing ability to disrupt both Asian and European security. Putin received a lavish reception in Pyongyang and signed a bilateral strategic partnership agreement that includes a mutual defense provision that echoes NATO’s Article 5 clause. Putin declared that Moscow has nothing to lose and is prepared to go “to the end” to achieve its goals in Ukraine. His visit serves as a reminder that North Korea not only enables Russia to continue its brutal war, but Moscow may enable Pyongyang to strike out against a close Western ally, South Korea, in a move that could destabilize both Asia and Europe.
Thus, European and Asian security have become increasingly interconnected since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Putin, enraged by increased Western military and financial support for Ukraine, has again made nuclear threats against countries supporting Ukraine. He has announced that Russia will develop a new class of intermediate-range nuclear weapons and may deploy them near NATO countries. He warns that, if Russia loses the war, the 1,000-year-old Russian state will collapse. This is, he says, an existential war for Russia’s survival. The West should, he insists, accept his latest peace plan. This would involve Ukraine eschewing NATO membership and withdrawing its troops from and recognizing the four territories annexed by Russia in September 2022, none of which Russia fully controls, as Russian territory.
Russia’s continuing military assault on Ukraine comes amidst an unprecedented rise in hybrid cyberattacks and acts of sabotage in Europe, including arson at a factory site belonging to a German arms and ammunition maker. Russian espionage activities are also on the rise. And while this is taking place, Moscow is reaching out to what it calls the “global majority” to present itself as the leader of the anti-imperialist world, claiming that it has no colonial past, and exhorting the Global South to follow it in resisting American “hegemony” and creating a new “democratic,” multipolar international order.
An unmistakable Asian dimension
The Washington summit was attended by NATO members and by four U.S. Asian allies—Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea. Given Putin’s recent trips to North Korea and Vietnam, it is becoming increasingly evident that the war in Ukraine and Russia’s threat to European security have acquired an important Asian dimension. North Korea publicly supports Russia’s war with Ukraine. Vietnam—where Putin traveled after Pyongyang—is neutral, but, like most of the Global South, has not imposed any sanctions on Russia. Vietnam has signed a number of defense and security cooperation agreements with the United States. Yet Vietnamese officials vowed to increase bilateral defense cooperation during Putin’s visit to Hanoi.
Reacting to the United States and European countries allowing Ukraine to use their weapons to strike into Russian territory, Putin warned that Russia would supply weapons to “regions of the world where strikes can be made against sensitive targets” among Ukraine’s allies. One can speculate about which countries that might involve, but North Korea is a prime candidate. Since Putin’s visit to Pyongyang, South Korea has said that it is contemplating providing Ukraine with weapons for the first time since the 2022 Russian invasion.
As U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently said, “What’s happening in the Indo Pacific space has real implications for our Allies. And there’s a recognition of that, and that recognition is turning into concrete and strong partnerships. [Japanese] Prime Minister [Fumio] Kishida may have said this best in the context of Ukraine when he said what’s happening in Ukraine today, may well be happening in East Asia tomorrow.”
At the Washington summit, the North Atlantic Council held a separate meeting with the four Indo-Pacific partners (IPP) and agreed to increase their cooperation in supporting Ukraine, cyber defense, countering disinformation and holding regular conversations about Russia’s ties with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea: “By supporting Ukraine, increasing defense spending, and through the development of individual NATO partnerships with IPP countries, Indo-Pacific partners are strongly investing in global security.”
Dealing with new realities
The NATO summit focused on the war in Ukraine and on the threats emanating from Russia’s aggression. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s presence highlighted the determination of the expanded alliance to counter Russia and support Ukraine—short of an offer of NATO membership. But the presence of Asian allies—particularly Japan and South Korea, who are regularly targeted by joint Russian-Chinese naval and air patrols—signaled the determination to counter Russia’s disruptive actions.
Last year, French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly vetoed the opening of a NATO liaison office in Tokyo. Perhaps it is time for NATO to revisit its Asian ties. European and Asian security cannot be decoupled. Russia’s war against Ukraine continues thanks to artillery and ballistic missiles from North Korea and Chinese exports of machine tools, microelectronics, and other technologies that are critical to sustaining the military hardware that Moscow is using to carry out its war. The alliance’s Washington Summit Declaration notes, for the first time, that China has become a “decisive enabler” of Russia’s war.
If NATO wants to ensure that Russia does not win this war, it will have to confront and deal with the new Asian realities. This will involve closer military, economic, and political cooperation with the West’s Asian allies on a number of levels, and it should also be part of a broader Western effort to counter Russia’s moves. The G7 and the European Union should be part of this effort. The NATO+4 format (with Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand) could be upgraded and strengthened to meet the new challenges.
American advocates who argue that the United States should focus on the Indo-Pacific threats it faces, and let the Europeans take care of the threats they face—primarily Russia and its war in Ukraine—are missing the point. The threats from and to Asia and the threats to and from Europe cannot be decoupled. They are part of a new nexus of authoritarian and revisionist states seeking to upend the current world order."
58,How should we provide benefits to gig workers?,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-should-we-provide-benefits-to-gig-workers/,Jonathan Gruber,"June 13, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",RESEARCH,"The past decade has seen an explosion in the market for “gig” workers who provide a wide variety of services for “platform companies” that contract for their services but do not count them as employees. Most notable is the growth in work at Transportation Network Companies (TNC) for which individuals drive customers from place to place (such as Uber and Lyft) and Delivery Network Companies (DNC) for which individuals drive goods from place to place (such as DoorDash and InstaCart). But the gig economy has exploded along other dimensions as well, such as freelancers on sites like Upwork and even crafts creation on Etsy.
The growth has been astonishing, although data on gig work is challenging to measure. Garin et al. (2023) use tax data to measure those earning income from platform companies.1 Since the nascent stages of such platform work in 2012, the number of gig workers has grown by 5 million, and by 2021 comprised approximately 3% of the U.S. workforce—about 30% of the self-employed workforce in the U.S. This was driven primarily by growth during the pandemic, where the number of platform workers more than doubled. Meanwhile, a survey of workers from the Pew Foundation in 2021 found that 9% of the workforce reported working for an online platform in the past 12 months; the difference across these sources partly reflects minimum earnings requirements for reporting gig earnings for tax purposes. The number of drivers for Uber and DoorDash is likely over 1 million each. Revenues of Uber and DoorDash are up roughly five times since 2017.
This shift has a wide variety of implications for the labor force and for society more generally. One of the most important relates to the provision of employee benefits. For most Americans, employer-sponsored benefits provide their primary source of protection against the costs of illness, short-term income losses due to injury, sickness, or unemployment, and income loss in retirement.
The employer-provided model doesn’t work well for gig workers, however. In the traditional labor market, employers provide these benefits to their full-time workers after some period of attachment to the firm. Gig workers value the flexibility of being able to vary their hours across platforms and over time. This makes it difficult to apply the traditional benefits model, raising questions such as who is sufficiently attached to the firm to qualify for benefits, and how to provide benefits when workers work across multiple platforms.
There are two solutions to this problem. The first is to reclassify gig workers into traditional employment roles, as has been proposed in recent legislation in some states, such as California’s AB 5. But such an approach is problematic for two reasons. The traditional employer model is eroding, and putting gig workers into a declining system does not appear to be an effective option. Moreover, the traditional employment relationship may constrain the flexibility that gig workers are looking for in these arrangements. As I show below, most gig workers are using this work to supplement their income, not as a main source of income, and the flexibility that these positions bring would be constrained by the rules of engagement for traditional employer-employee relationships.
The second is to introduce a new model that can address the problems that gig workers face in providing for their income and health security. I propose such a new model in this paper. This model is based on the lessons learned from a study I carried out surveying Uber drivers about their benefits preferences.2 In this paper, I begin by reviewing that study and the key lessons learned. I then turn to recommending a model for a new benefits platform that would provide security for gig workers."
59,The partially convergent Trump and Harris defense policies,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-partially-convergent-trump-and-harris-defense-policies/,Michael E. O’Hanlon,"September 12, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"There is a dichotomy, almost a contradiction, in comparing Donald Trump to Kamala Harris on matters of defense and the military. At one level, national security policy appears to be an area where there is more accord, and less debate, between the candidates than is the case in many other policy realms. However, national security policy may also be the place where there is the greatest potential for divergence based on the characters, personalities, and decision-making styles of the two candidates, should the nation face a crisis and have to consider the use of military force.
First, here are some of the areas where they (mostly) agree: Both the 2018 National Defense Strategy of the Trump-Pence administration under Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and the 2022 National Defense Strategy of the Biden-Harris administration under Secretary Lloyd Austin prioritize roughly the same things. Both promote a focus on great-power rivalry and deterrence over the emphasis on “rogue states” and terrorist organizations of the previous three decades. Trump focused in equal measure on Russia and China; Biden emphasized China more, calling it the “pacing challenge” rather than an adversary but clearly underscoring that given its resources and size, it was the potential challenger to watch most closely. Few that I know in Trump world would disagree with the Biden/Austin tweak to Mattis’ strategy; few in the Biden-Harris administration have anything critical to say about Jim Mattis and his earlier 2018 document as well as the budgetary priorities that went along with it. Neither Trump nor Biden sought to enlarge the military; both sought to modernize it more quickly than had been the case in recent decades to make it more lethal, survivable, and resilient.
The 2024 party platforms provide few differences of opinion as well. Both prioritize troop pay, the strengthening of the defense industrial base, and the modernization of the American nuclear deterrent. Trump’s platform places more emphasis on an expanded national missile defense “dome” and on expunging “woke” Democrats from the ranks of the national security community. The Democratic document inherited by Harris makes a (slight) nod to arms control and also criticizes Trump’s earlier occasional disparaging remarks about American servicemen and servicewomen. Trump promises to demand more equitable military burden sharing from allies; the Democrats celebrate the strengthening of alliances on their watch. These are all important points, but I find the areas of accord more striking than those of disagreement (unless and until Trump actually takes seriously the idea of breaking off U.S. security commitments to allies that fail to do enough burden sharing, as he has sometimes hinted he might).
Neither platform nor candidate is specific about what, if any, defense budget increases they might advocate. The track record is that Trump increased defense budgets notably on his watch, above and beyond the rate of inflation, whereas Biden and Harris, inheriting those increases, kept the real-dollar or inflation-adjusted defense budget steady. So, Trump’s legacy is slightly more “pro-defense” than that of Biden and Harris, but the differences are slight, and the pledges about where either candidate would take the defense budget going forward are imprecise and thus, indistinguishable.
So, as best I can tell, the real differences boil down to civil-military relations and also to possible decisions on the use of force.
First, to be fair to Trump, his tendency towards bellicosity in his rhetoric and his political style was not matched by his actual decisions on the use of force as president. He threatened to go to war with North Korea but later tried summitry with Kim Jong Un. He inherited a strategy to defeat ISIS that was showing promise, doubled down on it, and succeeded. He authorized the killing of Iranian terrorism mastermind Qasem Soleimani but otherwise avoided new uses of force for the most part. 
To be fair to Biden, although the Afghanistan withdrawal went badly, it was a decision on a given timeline that Trump had initiated, so if you don’t like the results of that withdrawal (and I don’t) you should probably blame both recent presidents (and I do). Also, Biden and Harris and team have done a generally good job in building and sustaining a coalition to help Ukraine fend off Russian attacks without risking direct American intervention in that war. They have also managed their way through several crises with China, over Taiwan and the South China Sea, that a less careful team might have misplayed. In his first term, to give Trump credit, he also managed to keep problems with China from blowing up into dangerous crises. But he had hired professionals in his first term—Mattis, Mark Esper, H.R. McMaster, John Bolton, Rex Tillerson, Mike Pompeo—that should get lots of the credit. However, eventually, he fired most of the people on that list, and it is not clear that he would hire equally competent national security officials in a second term. So, on crisis management, I give the nod to Harris not because she is a Democrat but because she fits in the modern bipartisan American tradition of studious consideration of options with a team of top-notch professionals before making momentous decisions on the possible use of American military force. Trump does not; he wings it based on personal instinct and intuition. My worries here are somewhat mitigated by my sense that Trump does not relish violence the way that some belligerent leaders in world history (or Vladimir Putin today) seem to. But they’re only somewhat mitigated.
Finally, there is the matter of civil-military relations. Trump had very tense relations with his second chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Mark Milley, largely over the events of January 6, 2021, but also in regard to the Lafayette Square incident after the killing of George Floyd and on other occasions. Trump has also been disparaging towards members of the military, as the Biden-Harris platform document reminds us. Trump did not fire lots of generals and admirals in his first term, to be fair, and also his disparaging commentary about the troops did not seriously damage military recruiting or retention on his watch (COVID-19 proved the bigger challenge on the recruiting front for both Trump and Biden). Yet Americans benefit enormously from a professional and de-politicized military today; it would be a shame if that were jeopardized by a future president.
Bottom line: On policy and spending, there is probably only modest difference of opinion between Trump and Harris. But on decision-making style on matters of war, peace, and civil-military relations, there is an enormous gulf between them that could have important consequences for how the United States handles any national security crises that might arise on the next president’s watch."
60,What do North Korean troop deployments to Russia mean for geopolitics?,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-do-north-korean-troop-deployments-to-russia-mean-for-geopolitics/,"Andrew Yeo, Hanna Foreman","October 29, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"In early October, Ukrainian intelligence reported that several thousand North Korean soldiers were undergoing training in Russia in preparation for deployment to the Ukrainian front line later this year. South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) later corroborated Ukraine’s assertions, sharing satellite images of Russian vessels transporting the first batch of 1,500 North Korean special forces to Russia’s Far East. On October 23, White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby confirmed the presence of at least 3,000 soldiers. The Pentagon now believes that 10,000 North Korean troops are in Russia with a contingent heading toward the Kursk region in western Russia to battle Ukrainian forces.
The large deployment of North Korean troops in Russia represents a troubling new phase in the Russia-Ukraine war while carrying deeper implications for global politics. We address five key questions related to accelerating North Korea-Russia military cooperation.
What do Russia and North Korea stand to gain?
Russian President Vladimir Putin will reap immediate military benefits from North Korean troops. Since August 2023, Russia has reportedly received 13,000 shipping containers that include artillery rounds, anti-tank rockets, and short-range ballistic missiles to replenish badly depleted Russian munitions and weapons. Now facing a potential shortage of conscripts, the use of North Korean troops will temporarily relieve domestic pressure to recruit more Russians this autumn. Deploying foreign forces to Ukraine also addresses the backlash Putin faced after sending fresh Russian conscripts to the front lines.
North Korea will likely receive additional economic benefits and greater military-technical assistance from Russia, possibly including satellite and rocket technology. Once opposed to North Korea’s nuclear program, Putin may now find it useful to help improve North Korea’s missile capabilities and nuclear weapons delivery systems. Russia may also help North Korea upgrade its aging submarine fleet. North Korean soldiers could gain valuable combat experience fighting alongside Russians and be able to evaluate firsthand how effective its military technology fares against Western-manufactured arms and defenses.
How effective are North Korean troops and what risks does the regime face?
It is unclear how well North Korean troops will perform in combat. Although North Korean troops are undergoing training in Russian military facilities in the Far East, differences in language, culture, training, and warfighting doctrine could diminish the effectiveness of North Korean forces until they are better integrated with Russian units.
Reportedly, Kim has dispatched special operations forces from the Eleventh Army Corps known as the “Storm Corps.” These are elite troops trained for infiltration and assassination missions, with more military training than new Russian conscripts sent to the frontlines. However, it seems unlikely that Kim Jong Un would continue to dispatch a large number of elite soldiers to Russia if casualties mount at the same rate as Russian casualties.
One risk the North Korean regime faces is the possibility of its soldiers deserting the battlefield and seeking to defect to Ukraine or South Korea. Although the claim has not been independently verified, Ukrainian intelligence reported that 18 North Korean soldiers stationed near the Russia-Ukraine border had deserted their positions.
It is possible that some North Korean soldiers who surrender or are captured by Ukrainian forces may not want to return to Russia or North Korea. These soldiers may seek asylum or ask to be transferred to South Korean authorities.
North Korean prisoners of war may need to be protected under the Geneva Convention and eventually returned to Russia or North Korea. However, South Korea’s defense minister described North Korean troops in Russia as mercenaries disguised in Russian uniforms and acting under Russian military command, suggesting that Ukraine may not be obligated to repatriate North Korean soldiers seeking asylum. The defection of North Korean special operation forces would represent an embarrassing blow to the Kim regime.
How has South Korea responded to North Korean troops in Russia?
From the South Korean perspective, Seoul has yet to say what might catalyze its direct involvement in the form of sending military personnel and lethal aid to Kyiv. To date, South Korea has helped backfill weapons for Ukraine by supplying arms to NATO members.
Since the start of the war, South Korea has been reluctant to directly send lethal weapons to Ukraine and has mostly provided economic and humanitarian support. However, this new development may force Seoul to consider supporting Kyiv by sending weapons, sharing intelligence, and sending military intelligence personnel. If Seoul decides to send arms to Kyiv, the move would require substantive legislative revisions to its Foreign Trade Act; South Korea is currently prohibited from sending lethal weapons to live conflict zones except for peaceful uses, and countries that purchase South Korean weapons cannot re-export them to third-party countries without Seoul’s permission.
Regardless of whether South Korea provides Ukraine with offensive weapons, Pyongyang’s actions have pushed Seoul to work more closely with its European partners, including NATO. On October 28, a delegation of South Korean intelligence and defense officials briefed NATO’s North Atlantic Council and Indo-Pacific partners on their assessments of North Korean troop deployments to Russia and pledged to continue coordination on monitoring the situation in Ukraine. Increased cooperation between South Korea and NATO will enable Seoul to share and receive information regarding North Korean combat capabilities and tactics and track North Korean troops sent to the Ukrainian front line. South Koreans could also assist Ukrainians in carrying out psychological operations to encourage North Korean soldiers to defect.
Where does China stand?
China has avoided comment when asked whether North Korean troops are in Russia. Publicly, Beijing has offered diplomatic platitudes calling for de-escalation in Ukraine and peace on the Korean Peninsula. Privately, however, Beijing remains worried about the risks that it cannot directly control, potential instability on its doorstep, and likely increased security cooperation between South Korea, Japan, and the United States and emerging coordination between NATO and Seoul as a response to Pyongyang’s military adventurism.
While Beijing has provided diplomatic and economic cover for Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, Beijing’s relationship with Pyongyang has been tepid lately. The communication gaps between the three governments have put China in the uncomfortable position of trying to prevent further regional destabilization, given its geopolitical and economic challenges.
What are the global implications of North Korea-Russia military cooperation?
The image of North Korean and Russian soldiers fighting together plays into the narrative of a growing “axis of upheaval” between China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran. To date, however, the most significant relationships between the four actors have been separate and bilateral in nature. 
The dispatch of North Korean troops to Russia indicates that Pyongyang is “all in” with assisting Russia’s unjust war effort in Ukraine. While North Korea has previously been known for its cyberthreat, money laundering, arms trafficking, and illicit trade activities, this new development may embolden Pyongyang to participate in other ongoing conflicts and future wars on behalf of like-minded partners opposed to the West.
North Korea’s troop presence in Russia has at least two longer-term implications. First, Putin has demonstrated again that, far from being isolated, countries are willing to support Russia during its war in Ukraine. The lengths North Korea has taken to enable Putin’s war may encourage other states to strengthen their own bilateral military ties with Russia; Iran, for example, may increase its cooperation with Russia as it braces for possible escalation with Israel.
Second, deeper Russia-North Korea military cooperation comes at a time of escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula. This includes North Korea’s recent destruction of inter-Korea roads and railways and the alleged incursion of South Korean drones into North Korea this month. North Korea’s decision to dispatch troops to Russia indirectly suggests that North Korea is hardening its strategic position against South Korea. Should Russia further boost North Korea’s weapons capabilities and deliver troops and munitions to Pyongyang through its Far East, the United States and its allies in Europe and Asia will need to prepare for a new phase of greater instability and possible escalation in Northeast Asia."

62,"State bond banks, the best kept secret in infrastructure finance, need a bigger role in rebuilding America",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/state-bond-banks-the-best-kept-secret-in-infrastructure-finance-need-a-bigger-role-in-rebuilding-america/,"Michael Gaughan, Adie Tomer","June 20, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",RESEARCH,"It’s been a historic few years for federal investment in American infrastructure and the built environment. The combined heft of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and the capital-eligible parts of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) will commit well over a trillion dollars in federal government contributions to the physical reconstruction and modernization of America.
Yet, with all the big news out of federal Washington, it’s easy to lose sight of who does most of the investing in American infrastructure and other fixed assets owned by the public: states and localities. The IIJA, for example, is likely to average about $170 billion in spending per year across all its programs. This compares with $300 billion in new infrastructure spending financed by the $4 trillion municipal bond market in 2023 alone.
Since the bulk of the IIJA and IRA move through either established state formula programs or private industry, both laws also fail to reach every community or qualify many of their non-traditional infrastructure assets for investment, such as renovated schools and recreation facilities. Even after ARPA’s local investment programs—of which most of the dollars are now committed—the unmet needs are still substantial. Aging schools alone are estimated to need $85 billion of investment annually.
As federal policymakers begin the long work of considering what’s next in infrastructure policy, they would be wise to strengthen one of America’s best-kept secrets in infrastructure policy: the humble and highly effective state bond bank. (Disclosure: One of the authors serves as Executive Director and Secretary of the Vermont Bond Bank, a position he has held since 2018.)
Unlike most federal infrastructure programs that target one infrastructure sector at a time, state bond banks provide a locally responsive tool through which federal dollars can be leveraged and channeled to all types of projects that are of high priority to the public. First created by the State of Vermont in 1969, a state bond bank (or bond bank throughout this brief) helps make social and physical infrastructure more affordable by providing access to low-cost capital for every community within a state. Bond banks further reduce the opportunity costs of investment by providing consistency in process and market specialization for any type of project, making them different than other state lending entities such as state revolving loan funds (SRF) for drinking water and clean water infrastructure.
Today, active state bond banks (or a form thereof) exist in an estimated 13 states—which is far too little reach for one of America’s most powerful tools to leverage private infrastructure capital for communities and projects of all sizes.1,2 To remedy this gap, the federal government should create a one-time $25 billion national block grant to incentivize the creation and growth of bond banks. Such a program would ensure the efficient leveraging of a one-time federal appropriation while also creating a durable path for helping rural areas, small urban municipalities, and other underserved places overcome longstanding investment gaps.
What is a state bond bank?
State bond banks are instrumentalities of states that help local governments and independent government units such as school boards access capital at a low cost. State bond banks typically operate with independence from the sponsoring state, even though they are publicly owned.
State bond banks help overcome gaps in information, scale, and credit to allow cities, towns, villages, school districts, and other forms of government achieve equitable access to capital. Traditionally, bond bank staff achieve these goals by pooling loans from around the state together into one security structure that stands behind tax-exempt bonds issued in the larger capital markets. The proceeds from the bank’s bond sale are then used to make loans for a wide range of local priorities from recreational paths to gravel pits.
These bonds are not pass-through transactions, or conduit bonds, and are held on the balance sheet of the state bond bank alongside the ultimate responsibility for repayment. More recently, state bond banks are fulfilling their missions by using the above structure with new sources of capitalization, like those in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
Historically, state bond banks succeeded in rural America where the size of capital needs is a mismatch with the scale required for local entities to access the capital markets effectively. The Vermont experience is illustrative. The median size community in the state is only 1,800 people while, over the last several years, the median size loan issued by the Vermont Bond Bank was $1 million. That’s far too small an amount to efficiently access the bond markets, which limits investors and can drive up both risk and costs for communities.
States typically offer credit enhancement as well, most commonly through an intercept (or offset) mechanism whereby dollars due to local communities are redirected to local debt service payments in the event of nonpayment. Like any lender, bond banks review loans for creditworthiness and undertake a portfolio management program, including cash management and ongoing credit monitoring. State bond banks and related borrowers then use standardized loan documents and related forms to help minimize transaction costs."

This spike in funding has come with an enormous opportunity and challenge: hiring, training, and retaining a generation of talent to advance these projects across transportation departments, water utilities, and other state and local entities. 
With almost 17 million workers currently constructing, operating, and maintaining the country’s infrastructure (and the potential for 1.5 million new jobs annually), there are many shoes to fill. Connecting more and different workers to careers in the infrastructure space—including younger individuals, women, people of color, and others historically overlooked or excluded—also has the potential to expand quality career pathways, which can offer higher pay, pose lower formal educational barriers to entry, and present additional benefits compared to other jobs nationally.  
Despite this opportunity, many state and local leaders are struggling to harness federal funding in ways that address both project needs and workforce development needs. Infrastructure owners and operators do not always coordinate with education and training providers, for instance, and the latter do not always understand how projects are funded, staffed, or ultimately executed. Yet a new collaborative strategy is emerging in different regions to help bridge these gaps: “infrastructure academies,” which serve as place-based destinations where employers and other workforce development partners collaborate to support prospective workers entering infrastructure careers, with an eye toward driving greater economic equity.  
Building off a 2018 Brookings report that profiled the newly launched DC Infrastructure Academy, this piece aims to further contextualize and demystify what these academies are attempting to do by focusing on a new example in Austin, Texas. The details matter for how these academies are structured, who is involved in their creation, and the extent to which they are even addressing these workforce gaps. But Austin’s infrastructure academy is not just an ad hoc experiment; through its ongoing design and implementation, it can help inform how other regional leaders may consider launching similar approaches.  
What are infrastructure academies? 
Preparing workers for infrastructure careers relies on a combination of efforts among public and private employers, workforce development boards, educational institutions, labor groups, community-based organizations, and other entities. Work-based learning opportunities, including apprenticeships and internships, are especially important for many workers in the skilled trades, who tend to develop knowledge and experience on the job. For example, workers interested in pursuing a career as a water treatment operator may rely on classroom instruction at a community college, receive on-the-job training at a water utility, and gain supportive services (e.g., transportation to a worksite) from a nonprofit group as they earn needed credentials and grow their competencies over time. 
Navigating such educational and training pathways can pose barriers to entry for prospective infrastructure workers. The siloed planning, lack of communication, and limited community outreach among infrastructure employers can also perpetuate hiring and training difficulties. However, the emergence of sector strategies—coordinated plans and programming among employers and workforce intermediaries to target specific industry needs—is helping these gaps. And when combined with other place-based strategies (including local hire and apprenticeship utilization requirements), leaders are addressing their infrastructure workforce needs head-on.  
Infrastructure academies embody both sector and place-based strategies by serving as a single destination for workers, employers, and educators to drive more coordinated infrastructure workforce development. At a basic level, they aim to introduce more students and job seekers to infrastructure careers through targeted coursework and applied learning opportunities. Although their specific design and reach vary, these academies can be located in one physical building, where prospective workers—particularly the out-of-work and other disadvantaged individuals—can quickly access training and supportive services.  
The DC Infrastructure Academy (DCIA) represents one of the first examples of this type of effort. Launched in 2018, DCIA is overseen by Washington, D.C.’s Department of Employment Services (DOES) and housed in a previously vacant elementary school in the city’s historically disadvantaged Ward 8 (and it will soon be relocated in a new, expanded facility). While DOES helps run DCIA, a variety of employers support training and potential job placement, including Pepco, Washington Gas, and DC Water. So far, DCIA has helped train more than 4,600 residents (and counting) for infrastructure careers, pulling talent across many different demographics.  
Examining the Austin Infrastructure Academy 
Austin is now blazing forward with its own infrastructure academy. Workforce Solutions Capital Area (WFSCA)—the workforce development board serving Austin and Travis County—has spearheaded this effort alongside other planning activities, including a labor and demand forecast and strategy plan for the mobility and infrastructure sector. This work was led by CivicSol, an advisory services firm based in Austin. That forecast, combined with conversations among regional leaders, has centered infrastructure as a key area of growth and opportunity for residents. Austin’s mobility and infrastructure sector already employs over 222,000 workers—the area’s second-largest sector, ahead of both health care and advanced manufacturing—and is projected to add 10,000 new jobs annually through 2040. The fact that most of these workers (60%) are earning above the region’s prevailing wage ($22 per hour) is attractive too. 
While still in the design phase, the Austin Infrastructure Academy aims to serve as “a central hub to integrate recruitment, comprehensive and unified training, and wraparound service support” for workers entering infrastructure careers, with a particular focus on economic equity. This includes aligning training programs with in-demand skills (e.g., for transit operators, mechanics, and engineers); helping facilitate job placement; and evaluating outcomes and performance over time. WFSCA is the academy’s administrator, but multiple other partners have been involved, including project sponsors, industry associations, community-based organizations, and training providers. Texas Mutual Insurance Company and Google.org made significant early financial contributions to support the Academy’s design. Another key partner, Austin Community College, will dedicate space for the Academy on their new campus in Southeast Travis County. Additionally, the Austin City Council has already greenlit funding for this effort, and Austin Community College is already supporting access to the Academy’s services at its Riverside Campus—speaking to the evolving number of activities involved in the Academy’s conception and implementation.

Pipa, Zoe Swarzenski","October 31, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"What is rural America?
There is no single official definition. Many people’s images of what it means to be “rural” are based on archetypes from the media or places they know. From a policy perspective, however, to be “rural” depends on how you define it—and the federal government defines rural in more than a dozen ways. 
The two most commonly used definitions are delineated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which uses population thresholds to distinguish between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan counties, and the Census Bureau, which uses housing and population density to distinguish between geographic areas that are urban and rural.  
Each metric paints a different picture of rural America. OMB classifies 13.8% of the country’s population, or 46 million people, as living in nonmetro counties. The Census Bureau classifies 20% of the country’s population, or 66.3 million people, as living in rural areas. That is a difference of more than 20 million people. Less than 45% of the Census rural population overlaps with the OMB non-metro population."

Rediker, Angela Stent, Yun Sun, Tara Varma, Valerie Wirtschafter, Andrew Yeo","October 21, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"For years, Western policymakers have largely dismissed BRICS as more bark than bite. After all, the bloc long aimed to create an alternative to Western dominance in the global financial system—and failed. BRICS has not rewritten the rules of international trade, no common BRICS currency has materialized, and its alternative payment systems have yet to dent the U.S. dollar’s global dominance. 
But it is not a good idea to take BRICS lightly—if nothing else, for the political symbolism surrounding the upcoming meeting in Kazan, Russia. Who would have thought that only two-and-a-half years after his brutal invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin would be hosting a summit attended by dozens, including U.S. partners like Egypt and NATO ally Turkey, which has recently expressed an interest in membership?  
The fact that such a meeting is happening at all signals a shift in global politics and exasperation with the U.S. role in the world—and that should concern Washington. BRICS represents more than just the fragmentation of the international system—it embodies growing resentment among middle powers toward the U.S.-led world order. In the aftermath of the war in Gaza, Russia and China have more effectively harnessed this anti-Western sentiment, capitalizing on frustrations over Western double standards as well as the use of sanctions and economic coercion by the West. It doesn’t mean that middle powers want to trade U.S. dominance for Chinese—but it means they are open to aligning with Russia and China for a more fragmented and autonomous world.  
On trade, BRICS has neither established its own trade regime nor institutions, but key trends hint at its growing influence. For example, China now has an alternative to the SWIFT payment system, though limited in use, and countries like Turkey and Brazil increasingly restructure their dollar reserves into gold. Currency swaps for energy deals are also a popular idea—all suggesting a desire for greater financial independence from the West. 
Washington should not ignore BRICS. The United States should focus on revitalizing the Group of 20 and on offering meaningful partnerships to key middle powers like Turkey, Brazil, and Saudi Arabia. BRICS is not the cause but an indication of a global insurgency. And if unaddressed, these groupings will eventually coalesce around a more coherent political and economic agenda.  "
66,Democracies are strongest when they stand together,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/democracies-are-strongest-when-they-stand-together/,"Jonathan Katz, Nathan Kohlenberg","October 16, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY + OP-ED,"In the early days of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, amid reports that Russian death squads had infiltrated the country to assassinate President Zelensky, the U.S. offered to evacuate him from Kyiv. Zelensky reportedly quipped, “I need ammunition, not a ride.” Recently, he got both when the White House announced new U.S. support for Ukraine. Zelensky visited Pennsylvania’s Scranton Army Ammunition Plant, a United States Army Joint Munitions Command (JMC) facility, which makes the 155-millimeter artillery shells Ukrainians need to continue fighting Putin-led Russia. The stakes could not be higher: As a worker at a Pennsylvania army depot noted, “what we [are] doing directly affects whether people live or die.”   
For many in Pennsylvania, with the federal government sending nearly $1.6 trillion to Pennsylvanian defense companies as of December 2023, assistance to Ukraine means—among other things—a surge in new well-paying manufacturing jobs in communities like Scranton. For Americans in Pennsylvania and across the U.S., however, it also means something more: a return to a proud bipartisan tradition and legacy of America supporting and providing assistance to democracies that stand up to tyranny.  
“We must be the great arsenal of democracy,” President Roosevelt proclaimed in a December 29, 1940 radio address. He argued for the U.S. to provide more military aid to Britain and countries fighting Nazi Germany and Axis partners. That assistance, buttressed by the labor of millions of American workers, was critical to defeating Axis powers, safeguarding U.S. democracy and security, and winning World War II.  
Now the forces of autocracy are rising with strengthened networks that threaten the U.S. and partners. These autocratic regimes are trying to disrupt U.S. elections and seek to weaken U.S.-Ukraine cooperation and democracy globally. 
Historically, autocracies have been capable of coordinated efforts. Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, and Fascist Italy formed the “Axis Powers” which collaborated before and during World War II. Today, help from the emerging axis of other authoritarian states—Iran, China, and North Korea—is vital to Russia’s efforts to evade sanctions and keep its military supplied with the weapons used to target Ukrainian civilians. These authoritarian states have a shared interest in making the world more hostile to democracy and freedom.   
America and its partners have the tools, conviction, and interest to prevent a return to a world in which wars of conquest, mass killings, and illegal annexation are permitted. That deepfelt motivation extends to Americans who support aiding Ukraine. Americans favor continuing to supply Ukraine with weapons by a 23-point margin and support authorizing Ukraine to use weapons to strike targets inside Russia by a 25-point margin. Americans understand that what Putin and Russia have done in Ukraine is wrong and that dictatorships triumph when people and nations do nothing to stand up to bullies and autocrats.  
A handful of members of Congress have tried to make a partisan issue of Zelensky’s visit to Pennsylvania even though the Ukrainian President visited other U.S. states, including Utah, where he signed a memorandum of understanding with Utah officials. 
It is more important than ever that U.S. support for Ukraine remain bipartisan as it has been in Congress since February 2022. Unity is needed on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue to ensure Ukraine gets the support it needs and to deter watchful autocrats from seeing Putin’s aggression as a winning strategy, including Xi in Taiwan. During his visit, Zelensky delivered a clear message: “the war in Ukraine needs to be stopped. Putin can’t win. Ukraine has to prevail.”   
Democracies are strongest when they stand together in the face of autocracy, as many Americans of both parties have done for decades. That solidarity, an unshakeable pillar of U.S. security, should be bolstered by standing with Ukraine, not punctured by disunity and praise for autocrats at the expense of allies and partners. We need to go beyond rancor and ensure that America remains the “arsenal of democracy”—committed to supporting partners and allies and ensuring our nation’s safety and prosperity. The arsenal of democracy in support of Ukraine was echoed perfectly by Joe Leary, President of the Local 847 International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union, who said, “Our members do this work every day, with little notice or fanfare…We were just happy to see Zelensky up close, because we want him to win.” "

With the expiration of many tax cuts and unmet climate targets, 2025 could be a crucial year for climate policy in the United States. Using an integrated model of energy supply and demand, this paper aims to assess climate policies that the U.S. federal government may consider in 2025 and to evaluate emissions reductions, abatement costs, fiscal impacts, and household energy expenditures across a range of policy scenarios. The model shows several key findings. First, the emissions reductions of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are significantly augmented under scenarios that add a modest carbon fee or, to a lesser extent, that implement a clean electricity standard in the power sector. Second, net fiscal costs can be substantially reduced in scenarios that include a carbon fee. Third, expanding the IRA tax credits yields modest additional emissions reductions with higher fiscal costs. Finally, although none of the policy combinations across these scenarios achieve the U.S. target of a 50-52 percent economy-wide emissions reduction by 2030 from 2005 levels, the carbon fee and clean electricity standard scenarios achieve these levels between 2030 and 2035.
Introduction
Because much of U.S. climate policy currently operates through the tax code, 2025 could prove to be a crucial year for U.S. climate policy choices: At the end of 2025, a large number of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) provisions are scheduled to expire. Policymakers across the political spectrum have expressed support for extending at least some of the expiring tax cuts and a desire to put new tax policy ideas on the negotiation table.
That creates an opportunity for pragmatic evaluation of the trade-offs that result from—among other factors—lower tax revenues and continued incentives to invest in decarbonization. In particular, a full extension of TCJA provisions would come at a large revenue cost, estimated to approach $4 trillion over 10 years (Clausing and Sarin 2023), in a time of already high deficits and rising debt. In addition, further action is needed to meet the United States’ Paris Agreement commitment to decarbonization. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which has been described as the largest piece of climate legislation in U.S. history, relies on tax credits, loans, and direct spending to help meet that commitment. But even that package is projected to bring the United States only part way toward its commitment of 50–52 percent economy-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions in emissions by 2030 relative to 2005 (Bistline et al. 2023).
The combination of scheduled expirations of lower tax rates, fiscal pressures, and unmet climate targets suggests that a range of climate policy options could be under consideration as policymakers debate future tax policy. In a recently released NBER working paper, John Bistline, Kimberly Clausing, Neil Mehrotra, James Stock, and Catherine Wolfram (Bistline et al. 2024) analyze seven potential climate policy scenarios facing the U.S. federal government in 2025 and their associated trade-offs.
Climate policy scenarios
The seven scenarios considered here are (a) policies that could plausibly be under consideration in 2025, although consideration of each is more or less likely depending on outcomes of the 2024 elections and on future economic conditions; and (b) tax and expenditure policies with potentially major fiscal and/or emissions impacts. To analyze these policy options, Bistline et al. (2024) use the Electric Power Research Institute’s (EPRI) U.S. Regional Economy, Greenhouse Gas, and Energy (US-REGEN) model (EPRI 2021). These climate policy scenarios are summarized in table 1."

70,What is US foreign assistance?,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-is-us-foreign-assistance/,George Ingram,"September 12, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Eight decades of American foreign aid has generated confusion among U.S. taxpayers on how and how many tax dollars are spent on foreign assistance.
As we are in the midst of an election cycle, it is important that candidates, voters, and media have a better understanding of how taxpayer dollars are currently used to advance our national interest.
What is foreign aid?
Foreign assistance falls into one of three basic categories:
Humanitarian assistance (food, medical care, shelter, security) for life-saving relief from natural and manmade disasters.
Development assistance that promotes the economic, social, and political development of countries and communities.
Security funding that helps strengthen the military, police, and other security forces of a country.
The relative proportions vary each year. The 2022 budget of $70 billion was representative of the split, with humanitarian assistance accounting for approximately one-quarter, development assistance for almost two-thirds, and security assistance less than one-fifth.
Very little assistance is delivered as cash to governments, a recent exception being support for the government of Ukraine (the use of which is checked and rechecked) in response to the Russian invasion. Most funds for humanitarian and development assistance are provided through U.S., global, and local organizations and businesses.
How much of US gross domestic product (GDP) is devoted to foreign aid?
Historically, as demonstrated by the chart below, foreign aid peaked at 3% of U.S. GDP during the Marshall Plan program to resuscitate Europe following the end of World War II. Subsequently, it ranged from 1% to just less than 0.5% during much of the Cold War. In recent decades, it has hovered in the range of less than 0.33% of U.S. GDP.
In terms of the federal budget obligations, foreign assistance accounts for about 1%. In fiscal year 2022, foreign assistance totaled $58 billion and in fiscal year 2023 about $63 billion (final figure not available)."

72,Russia-Afghanistan relations in the aftermath of the Moscow attack,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/russia-afghanistan-relations-in-the-aftermath-of-the-moscow-attack/,Vanda Felbab-Brown,"March 28, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"The horrific terrorist attack against the Crocus concert hall in Moscow has been claimed by the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), the same Afghanistan-based terrorist group that bombed the Kabul airport’s Abbey Gate in August 2021, killing 13 U.S. soldiers and 170 Afghans. The United States has also attributed the attack to ISKP. Yet to deflect attention from the Russian security services’ incompetence and to instrumentalize the attack to increase Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian grip and war efforts in Ukraine, Russia’s propaganda is seeking to link the attack to Ukraine. This disinformation is part and parcel of Russia’s (and Iran’s) persistent lies that the United States created ISKP, as Russian interlocutors for years claimed to me and others.
Although the ISKP attack may complicate Russia’s relations with the Taliban, it is unlikely to alter them fundamentally. While the Taliban’s repeated promise that it would prevent international attacks from Afghan soil is further discredited, ISKP is the one terrorist group that the Taliban has been fighting with determination and consistency even after coming to power. Russia might ask the Taliban for further specific actions, but it has adjusted itself to Taliban rule, supporting the Taliban at multilateral fora, and it doesn’t really have alternatives in Afghanistan.
ISKP’s international terrorism
In its propaganda, ISKP has long highlighted Russia as a key international villain and target. ISKP grievances include Russia’s support for the Bashar Assad regime in Syria, repression of Muslims in Chechnya and other parts of the world, and Russian counterinsurgency in Afghanistan. The United States, Iran, Pakistan, and India also feature high on ISKP’s list of enemies.
ISKP’s external operations against a wide range of international actors have increased over the past two years, as its prospects of conquering a significant part of Afghanistan from the Taliban have diminished. For example, in April 2022, ISKP fired a salvo of Katyusha rockets against the Uzbek city of Termez. In May 2022, it launched a similar barrage against Tajikistan. In October 2022, its attack on a Shiite shrine in Iran killed many worshipers, as did its other Iran operations—in April 2023 in Shiraz and in January 2024 in Kamran.
ISKP has also repeatedly attacked international targets in Afghanistan: the Russian and Pakistani embassies in Kabul in September and December 2022 and a hotel frequented by Chinese businessmen.
ISKP has been actively and successfully recruiting outside of Afghanistan, including in Pakistan, Tajikistan, Central Asia, and Syria. Russia claims that the Crocus attack perpetrators it captured were from Tajikistan.
ISKP’s external operations and attacks against international targets in Afghanistan seek to demonstrate its perseverance despite the Taliban’s military actions and undermine the Taliban’s successful external engagements. ISKP likely calculates that by souring the Taliban’s relations with Russia and Afghanistan’s neighbors, it can augment Afghanistan’s economic woes and reduce financial flows to the Taliban, destabilizing its rule. ISKP also likely hopes that by inducing the Taliban’s regional isolation, it can grow more powerful on the battlefield and prevail in any ensuing Afghan civil war, which Russia and regional actors want to avoid above all else.
ISKP-Taliban relations
ISKP emerged in Afghanistan a decade ago in direct opposition to the Taliban. Its core members were Taliban commanders who, for various reasons, such as their bloodthirstiness, ran afoul of the then Taliban leader, Akhtar Mansour. Some of the commanders Mansour fired sought to incite an anti-Shiite sectarian war in Afghanistan; Mansour opposed this, as he was actively courting ethnic minorities to join the Taliban.
The Taliban has been fighting ISKP with determination and resolve since the latter’s inception. In 2016 and 2017, the Taliban’s military pressure forced ISKP cadres into eastern Afghanistan where they extensively recruited Pakistani militants and fighters from dissatisfied local tribes. Jihadists from abroad joined the new Islamic State branch, and ISKP also intensively intermingled with another militant group in eastern Afghanistan: Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). (The Taliban’s persistent fear that TTP members might join ISKP and fight the Taliban explains why the Taliban has not been willing to crack down on the TTP despite its intensified attacks against Pakistan and Pakistan’s pressure on the Taliban to do so.)
From 2018-2019, the Taliban’s ground operations against ISKP in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province crucially supplemented the U.S. air campaign against the group, smashed its rural base, and dispersed it into Afghanistan’s northern and urban areas.
In April 2023, the Taliban killed the ISKP commander who organized the August 2021 Kabul airport attack. It has eliminated other ISKP commanders, including the group’s presumed deputy commander, interim leader, head of intelligence, and shadow minister of justice. As a result of Taliban actions, ISKP attacks in Afghanistan decreased last year. In late 2022, the Taliban also presumably decimated ISKP cells targeting Uzbekistan & Tajikistan.
ISKP is the only terrorist group in Afghanistan that the Taliban actively fights. Due to the Taliban’s ideological bent, global jihadist obligations and debts, and decades of intermarriage with other militant actors, it has merely sought to manage Afghanistan’s other terrorist groups, such as the TTP, al-Qaida, and Central Asian militants. The Taliban moves the groups away from its neighbors’ borders, places them (temporarily) in special camps, and separates the fighters from their families. However, the Taliban has not been willing to arrest, kill, or extradite them. The Taliban also merely manages Uyghur militants, China’s top concern, even though it looks to China for badly-needed economic investment and trade far more than Russia.
Russia’s and regional counterterrorism diplomacy
Russia, regional actors, and the West are highly concerned with preventing terrorism spillovers from Afghanistan, and all remain sensitive to the risk that an Afghan civil war would provide a dangerous breeding ground for terrorists and stimulate much larger migration flows. To meet these challenges, Russia, regional actors, the United States, and Great Britain have maintained a counterterrorism dialogue with the Taliban.
Russia, Iran, and China have reconciled themselves to Taliban rule. The three are lukewarm toward Western economic sanctions on the Taliban, such as the freeze of the Afghan central bank’s assets, and unmotivated by issues of human rights, civil liberties, and women’s rights. They have even given up advocating for the representation of their ethnic kin powerbrokers in the Taliban government.
Russia has been developing its relations with the Taliban for years. By 2017, Russia was providing the Taliban with weapons and intelligence to fight ISKP and the United States. Russia sought to make the United States militarily bleed and entangle itself in Afghanistan even as Moscow opposed long-term U.S. bases in Afghanistan. Since the U.S. withdrawal in 2021, Russia has labored to reduce U.S. influence in the region. However, Russia’s efforts to position itself as an Afghan kingmaker haven’t panned out. Like everyone else, Russia has not been able to move the Taliban on internal rule in Afghanistan even though it has tacitly supported the Taliban in various international fora, including in a recent multilateral meeting in Doha by not insisting on a new U.N. special envoy whom the Taliban opposes. Along with China, Russia has condemned Western sanctions and called for engagement with the Taliban (though Russia has not pushed to remove the sanctions at the United Nations). But the Taliban has continued to snub Moscow on international diplomacy at various times.
China has gone the furthest in normalizing relations with the Taliban by accepting the latter’s ambassador to Beijing in December 2023. Chinese businesses have also slightly increased their exploration of trade and resource extraction opportunities in Afghanistan packaged within a renewed possibility that the Taliban-run Afghanistan may join the Belt and Road Initiative.
Surprisingly, Iran has developed the deepest access to the Taliban’s reclusive Haibatullah and his inner circle, despite Tehran’s long-standing sectarian rivalries with the Taliban and recent military skirmishes over water. Like others, Tehran calculates that it is stuck with the Taliban. Moreover, Kandahar and Kabul insiders tell me that the Taliban has permitted Tehran to continue recruiting fatemiyoun Shiite brigades in Afghanistan for its “axis of resistance” operations in the Middle East. It is notable that after the January Kamran bombing, Tehran did not strike targets in Afghanistan and instead hit alleged assets of Jaish al-Adl, another militant Sunni group in Pakistan.
With less influence over the Taliban than Iran, Russia should note Iran’s restraint. Moscow can ask the Taliban for specific actions against ISKP, and the Taliban is likely to grant them. But beyond that, Moscow can do little more than boost its military readiness in Central Asia —including at its bases in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, something it had already signaled before the Crocus attack—and become more diligent about monitoring and stemming jihadi terrorist networks in Russia.
Moscow’s effectiveness with the Taliban is as constrained as everyone else’s, and its leverage is even more limited. Russia provides virtually no humanitarian aid to Afghanistan—not that the West has been able to translate it into inducing less odious internal Afghan policies—and its economic engagement with Afghanistan is small. Russia may threaten the Taliban with opposition to lifting sanctions and travel bans against the Taliban, but since there is no current prospect for their removal anyway, little leverage results. And building up Afghan alternatives, i.e., the very weak National Resistance Front that has been flailing in its efforts to fight the Taliban, would take a long time and bring uncertain payoffs.
Russia may feel frustrated with the Taliban over the Crocus attack, but its false-flag Ukraine propaganda aside, it has few cards to play with the Taliban."
73,Atlanta’s water burst is the latest reminder of America’s mounting water bill,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/atlantas-water-burst-is-the-latest-reminder-of-americas-mounting-water-bill/,Joseph W. Kane,"June 6, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Following a string of water main bursts in Atlanta, the country is once again grappling with an age-old conundrum: how to stay ahead of an increasingly intractable list of water infrastructure challenges. Corroded pipes—some nearly a century old—failed near downtown and Midtown Atlanta, leading to shutoffs, boil-water advisories, and growing frustrations for thousands of households and businesses (the final tally is still unclear). Repair crews raced to fix the bursts and local leaders pledged financial relief for those affected, but ongoing concerns remain over the full extent of the water system’s needs.
Atlanta’s water needs are locally problematic, but they are also nationally emblematic of a broader water infrastructure challenge: America is failing to invest enough in its water systems.
From Flint, Mich., to Jackson, Miss., to a seemingly unending number of urban and rural communities, the country’s water infrastructure is aging and in need of repair. Contaminated drinking water, including lead pollution, is often the most glaring sign of an often-invisible challenge. But leaking pipes, combined sewer overflows, and other chronic issues persist too. An increasingly destructive climate, including more frequent floods and droughts, is not helping matters either. The ripple effects of these failures are also extensive across different systems, leading to network failures across neighborhoods and entire regions.
More than $600 billion in investment is estimated to be needed over the next 20 years to keep up with all the necessary improvements, according to the latest EPA national water assessments. Even with more federal funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), these estimates continue to escalate.
Water main bursts like those in Atlanta are the quintessential example of our investment backlog. An estimated 260,000 pipe failures happen each year, or about 11.1 breaks for every 100 miles of pipes, based on a survey conducted by Utah State researchers. Many of these pipes are older (53 years on average) and made of more susceptible materials such as cast iron. But more striking is that an estimated 20% of pipes in this survey are beyond their useful life and will require $452 billion to replace.
While these various water infrastructure needs and costs are concerning in themselves, the bigger issue is the lack of financial capacity to address them. Local water utilities are the primary owners and operators of this infrastructure, responsible for upwards of 90% of all public spending each year on the country’s water needs. Yet, with more than 50,000 utilities in the U.S., they are often highly localized and fragmented in their operations and service areas, as well as limited in their ability to generate predictable and durable revenue from ratepayers. That’s especially the case in cities like Flint and Jackson that have endured population loss and economic disinvestment over many decades. The tension between balancing water investment and affordability is ever-present.
The financial pressure is immense on local utilities—and other state agencies—who are constantly trying to cobble together enough resources to stay ahead of these needs. Beyond increasing rates, utilities are implementing new fees (e.g. stormwater fees) to keep up with the pace of repairs and other regulatory pressures. They are appealing to voters and passing ballot referenda; Atlanta, in fact, recently approved a one-cent sales tax to cover needed water upgrades. Utilities are also investing in more cost-effective designs, technologies, and other upgrades to provide more reliable service; Atlanta has also invested in widespread pipe improvements and more resilient green infrastructure installations.
But even these steps are not enough, as Atlanta’s recent experience demonstrates. So where does the country go from here?
The first step is to establish increased, sustained federal water funding. While the IIJA pumped about $57 billion into a host of different water infrastructure improvements, this figure still pales in comparison to the price tags noted earlier. Even when including additional funding for watershed and resilience improvements from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), there is still an outstanding needs gap. Federal investment, ideally tuned to need and ability to pay, can ensure all communities gain the resources they need. Recent conversations in Washington have generally supported more investment, including reauthorization of funding for flood control and other waterway projects. But the reality is that federal funding lags behind the full scale of water needs nationally, and utilities are scrambling for predictable resources.
The second step is to support continued local and state experimentation. While many utilities are struggling to simply keep up with existing repairs, that should not be an excuse for failing to test more proactive and collaborative solutions. Considering alternative revenue sources, breaking down governance siloes, and creating new asset management strategies are among these possible solutions. Admittedly, larger urban water systems tend to have greater capital budgets, existing financial resources, and staffing levels to accelerate new types of projects and other repairs. Seattle, for instance, has established more comprehensive and community-led plans around different upgrades, as have utilities in Milwaukee, Washington, and other cities. But utilities in more resource-constrained cities like Camden, N.J., and Buffalo, N.Y., are also launching innovative plans and partnerships to accelerate improvements.
Atlanta’s water dilemma is not an isolated phenomenon. Expect more water disruptions in the months and years to come. At this point, it’s not a question of if, but when in many communities. As these challenges and their associated price tags mount, though, they will serve as continual reminders of the need for more sustained funding and proactive innovation."
74,Eight facts about permitting and the clean energy transition,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/eight-facts-about-permitting-and-the-clean-energy-transition/,"Lauren Bauer, Wendy Edelberg, Cameron Greene, Olivia Howard, Linsie Zou","May 22, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",RESEARCH,"During the 2021 Leaders Summit on Climate, President Biden pledged that, on the road to economy-wide net zero emissions in 2050, the U.S. power sector would be carbon pollution free by 2035 (White House 2021). Meeting these goals requires building clean energy infrastructure at an unprecedented speed. Permitting reform—that is, changing the processes for obtaining government approval to build and operate energy generating, energy transmitting, and energy storage systems—has attracted notice because permitting-related bottlenecks have stymied both the speed and the scale of the clean energy transition. In this set of facts, The Hamilton Project highlights key economic facts about the state of permitting reform and where attention should be focused to accelerate building out clean energy infrastructure.
Since 2012, policymakers have instigated a series of modest reforms to the federal permitting process, through actions such as establishing and supporting the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (Liscow 2024), streamlining review processes (Minott, Fishman, and Jacobs 2023), and expanding the use of categorical exclusions (White House 2024). Over the past 15 years, federal permitting durations have decreased (fact 2), in part due to these policy actions. While such actions improve permitting efficiency, nearly all wind and solar projects are exempt from the three most relevant federal permits (fact 1). Intense focus on federal permitting reform will not speed up most clean energy infrastructure projects.
Nonetheless, there are significant permitting issues that inhibit project completion—but they are typically at the state and local levels. In 2023, researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) surveyed utility-scale wind and solar developers, asking them what the leading causes of solar and wind project cancellation have been for projects that were cancelled in the preceding five years. These developers, representing firms that comprise about half of the solar and wind capacity in their respective markets, were asked to pick up to three reasons for cancellations. Figure A shows that the two leading causes of cancellation of wind and solar projects in the five years before the poll were local ordinances or zoning and grid interconnection. Local ordinances or zoning are enforced through the requirement of local permits. Grid interconnection requires site-specific feasibility studies, effectively a type of permit, and occurs in parallel to external permitting processes, typically at the state and local levels. Community opposition is also tied into permitting, insofar as the permitting process itself is how projects can be challenged; those too are mostly at the local level. In fact, some believe agencies’ long permitting processes are a proactive defense against future citizen lawsuits (Sud, Patnaik, and Glicksman 2023). These three reasons are also the top reasons that developers gave for project delays of six months or longer (Nilson, Hoen, and Rand 2023)."
75,Bring US-Turkish relations in from the cold,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/bring-us-turkish-relations-in-from-the-cold/,Rich Outzen,"October 30, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"In one sense, U.S.-Turkish relations had a productive 2024, reversing a decade and a half of tension and deterioration. The exchange of Turkish approval for Sweden’s NATO accession for American approval of Turkish purchase of new F-16V aircraft and upgrade kits marked positive momentum after years of drift on defense industrial cooperation and regional security. Moreover, the second year of the Strategic Mechanism implemented to address bilateral problems and opportunities provided greater transparency, while quiet diplomacy by the U.S. ambassador in Ankara, Jeff Flake, helped facilitate a significant new coproduction deal for artillery ammunition.  
Yet as 2024 enters its final months, the momentum seems to have stalled. The Turkish F-16 order has been scaled back. The relationship between Presidents Joe Biden and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan deteriorated over the course of the year, largely as a result of divergence over the war in Gaza. Tensions over spotty Turkish enforcement of export bans of U.S.-origin sensitive equipment to Russia have grown. 
U.S.-Turkish relations have always had their difficulties, but an additional development makes navigating such obstacles even trickier. Specifically, a view has gained currency in Washington centered on the premise that U.S.-Turkish tensions may not be worth solving. According to this view, Washington has little to gain from addressing Turkish concerns, Ankara can’t or won’t make transactions in good faith, or Ankara has adopted positions so irreconcilable with U.S. and Western interests that there is no point in trying. Proponents of this view get several important points wrong but have effectively amplified the message nonetheless. 
Pitching hardball
The most extreme version of the leave-Turkey-out-in-the-cold argument asserts that Ankara actively undermines U.S. interests—interest antagonism rather than divergence—and is irredeemable as an ally as long as Erdoğan remains in power. The argument denies both the potential and actual geopolitical value of the U.S.-Turkish alliance, and typically rests on an exaggerated litany of outrage citing Turkish statements, diplomatic stances, trade actions, and regional interventions that their authors consider outrageous. According to this narrative, Erdoğan should be treated as “a transnational threat that is an insult to democratic governance worldwide.” 
A more nuanced version of the argument concedes Turkey’s weight and value as an ally but holds that the current relationship requires a punitive and coercive approach by Washington to get positive movement on key U.S. interests. The prescription for this diagnosis consists of attempting to bypass and isolate the Turks while pressing for political change in the country. Over the longer term, this line of thinking concedes the loss of Turkey as a functioning ally and cautions against efforts to forge consensus by navigating contentious issues on a transactional basis. Instead, Washington should ignore Ankara—where our interests overlap, cooperation will emerge on its own, and where they do not, we should work against the Turks together with other regional actors. 
The list of analysts and think tanks in Washington espousing the avoid-Turkey line is not short. Interestingly, it is less common across the Atlantic, where Chatham House, the Royal Uniformed Services Institute, the German Institute for International Security Affairs, and other sober analysts remain engaged and balanced, if still critical, in their Turkey analysis. The more shrill tone of the Washington-based commentariat helps explain why the Biden administration pursued a “cold shoulder” approach during its first year, despite prior warnings against a rift from some Biden policy hands. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and deteriorating conditions in the Middle East reaffirmed the need for close bilateral dialogue and cooperation on regional issues with Turkey, the Biden administration pursued closer engagement and renewed collaborative projects, but the tone of policy commentary has not really changed much. For a variety of reasons, numerous policy shapers and analysts want to see the United States keep Turkey at arm’s length. 
Wisdom or folly?
What could possibly go wrong with a policy based on sidelining, marginalizing, ignoring, or punishing a potent ally? In a world of perfect hegemony, the policy would carry little risk: the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must. The logic of ambivalent antagonism toward Turkey rests upon a presumption of hegemony that has clearly been debunked, however, by an era of great power competition. The positive value of U.S.-Turkish relations when they are based on forged consensus, and their negative value when they are marked by estrangement and antagonism, implies a need for a shrewd mix of incentives and disincentives that reflects warmth in public and tough bargaining in private. 
There are at least five good reasons why marginalizing or punishing Turkey is neither prudent nor, in a final analysis, possible. The first is that Ankara has adroitly expanded its diplomatic and trade networks over the past two decades, enjoying partnerships with a diverse array of powers great and small, thereby reducing its vulnerability to coercion or isolation by the West. The Turks now deploy the third-largest network of foreign representations in the world. Turkish statesmen have proven agile enough to improve ties with even bitter regional rivals over time, including Egypt, the Gulf countries, Greece, Armenia, and (prior to the post-October 7 Gaza war) Israel. This diplomatic agility makes it very hard to assemble coalitions to pressure Ankara, as the Turks have built an impressive array of diplomatic partners disinclined to try to force their hand. Especially given prevailing views in Europe and the Middle East that America’s ability to responsibly orchestrate world events—hegemony—has declined, the value of a stable and prosperous Turkey as part of the emerging regional order has commensurately risen—making pressure campaigns directed from Washington even less likely to succeed.  
Secondly, Ankara has developed effective hedging strategies to balance great power pressure by deepening strategic dialogue, trade ties, and defense cooperation with international actors—first and foremost with the United States and NATO, but also with Russia, Iran, Pakistan, Ukraine, Qatar, and numerous states in Central Asia and Africa. Turkey has developed power projection strategies and military partnerships with dozens of countries, none of whom should be expected to join coercive campaigns. Because Ankara engages with the West, anti-Western powers, and the Global South simultaneously, its trade and security networks are difficult to curtail or collapse. Ankara still depends more on the West than any others in economic and strategic terms but has mitigated the degree of dependency (and thus vulnerability to coercion) through this hedging. 
Thirdly, in light of the diversification and resiliency of Turkish diplomatic, trade, and security networks, simply ignoring or working around Ankara is tantamount to ceding influence over a potent geopolitical actor to its other partners. The European Union has already committed this error, and Turkish aspirations to join the BRICS bloc were a pointed signal to Brussels that cold shoulders open doors for other actors. How would “working around” Turkey work, exactly, in the Black Sea region, the eastern Mediterranean, Central Asia, and North and East Africa? Turkey’s access and influence over these areas are significant, whereas the U.S. interest in them tends to be more partial and intermittent. By not forging cooperative approaches in these areas, the United States greatly reduces the prospects of successful policies in any of them.  
Fourthly, divergence and distance in U.S.-Turkish bilateral relations incur significant opportunity costs which undermine both players’ regional strategies. In the Balkans, the Caucasus, the Black Sea, Africa, and Central Asia, the two allies’ interests significantly overlap in advancing political stability and trade, improving humanitarian conditions, and limiting control by Russia, China, or Iran. Libya is an interesting example wherein Washington and Ankara both supported the Tripoli government while it was under assault by the forces of Khalifa Haftar and Russian mercenaries. Turkey acted unilaterally and over U.S. warnings to halt Haftar and stabilize Tripoli, rather ironically laying the groundwork for U.N.-led negotiations that largely halted the war. There are at least a dozen other crisis and conflict zones that would benefit from the United States and Turkey working together for stability, but coordinated strategy and action do not forge themselves—and cannot occur in a “cold shoulder” environment.  
Finally, in an era of great power competition, successful coalition and alliance management greatly impacts competitive outcomes. In a world in which Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea are working together actively to undermine U.S. power and interests, ignoring or marginalizing allies—even imperfectly aligned ones—is strategic folly. The United States and its closest allies must keep every powerful partner in the proverbial tent to the greatest degree possible, needing all the friends it can get in such a struggle; they do not have the luxury of playing hard to get.
Productive steps
The binary proposition of full and predictable alignment with Washington or punitive consequences is a false dilemma, and the complicated geopolitics of the 21st century call for something more feasible, and more likely to garner positive results. A 2023 study by the German Marshall Fund (GMF) sketched out such an approach for “global swing states,” defined as having “significant leverage in international affairs but varying preferences for cooperation.” Turkey was one of the six most prominent pivotal players, along with Brazil, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa. All practice some version of “strategic multialignment,” with transactionalism rather than solidarity as their driving force. 
In an era marked by strategic competition, mid-sized powers enjoy greater power and greater flexibility than during periods of strict bloc alignment (bipolarity) or unipolar hegemony. They are positioned to choose positions on the basis of mutual advantage and carefully crafted compromise with the United States and the West, or to hedge against Western punitive action in the absence of trust and assurance. “The United States and its allies will continue to see their global influence wane unless they take steps to reverse the trend through greater engagement with these powers,” as the GMF report puts it, by avoiding binary equations and showing mutual respect for national sovereignty.        
The Turkish case shows that adroit senior-level diplomacy can produce effective transactional relations and build a modicum of trust. Through energetic and sustained engagement by several senior officials in the Biden administration—including recently departed Ambassador Jeff Flake, the State Department’s Victoria Nuland, and CIA Director Bill Burns—mutually beneficial deals on NATO accession for Sweden, the sale of F-16 fighters, and coproduction of artillery ammunition were hammered out. Much more is possible, and there is no time to waste in pursuing broader reconciliation and collaborative efforts. The results could be beneficial for both partners with regard to mitigating China’s and Russia’s revisionist impulses, stabilizing the Middle East, aiding Ukraine’s survival and Africa’s development, enhancing trade, and pursuing interests in other areas. To argue against seeking convergence in these areas is policy malpractice, despite any therapeutic or cathartic value obtained by counseling it."

Most conspicuously, the administration’s major spending bills—the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), the Chips and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)—stand out for their sheer size.
Together, the bills loom historically large and account for some $3.8 trillion in outlays aimed at modernizing the U.S. economy. What comes after them in the next administration, if anything, is a vital question.
And yet, beyond the big bills’ scale, something else matters intensely about this legislation: the inclusion within it of nearly $80 billion in explicitly “place-based” industrial policy that is now being tested in the nation’s regions.
Authorized by the 117th Congress but in many cases under appropriated, the nearly two dozen individual place-based economic development programs embedded in the big policy packages stand out as a critical experiment for a nation that has been struggling with stark regional divides and uneven economic progress.
The “place-based” experiment matters because “place-based” policies—which channel investments or other interventions into particular locations—reflect a growing recognition that the nation’s economy is itself place-based—shaped by a tilework of distinct local economies—and requires place-focused problem-solving.
As such, the new place-based economic investments have put into action compelling new programs such as the Economic Development Administration’s Regional Technology and Innovation Hubs and the National Science Foundation’s Regional Innovation Engines that take a fresh stab at engaging more directly, precisely, and efficiently with the roots of the nation’s economic issues. Such programs purport to support “bottom-up” local problem-solving that gets at the “micro” underpinnings of broader “macro” challenges, whether it be building up the nation’s semiconductor sector in Phoenix to compete with China or improving worker training for an advanced mobility cluster in Tulsa.
But now, the presidential election may bring a major decision point. The presidential candidates each point to the China competition and the struggles of places “left behind,” but they would likely train very different views on place-based initiatives.
Kamala Harris appears fully committed to the Biden-Harris focus on large, place-focused grant competitions channeled to top-quality ideas from places—often ones scarred by deindustrialization. In her September 25 speech in Pittsburgh on industrial strategy, Harris spoke of “prioritizing investments for strengthening factory towns” and “investment that brings all places and workers along”—a clear reassertion of the Biden-Harris administration’s focus on place-based growth strategies.
For his part, Donald Trump expresses anger at the damage wrought by the deindustrialization caused by Chinese low-cost impacts but doesn’t have much to say about place-oriented industrial policy. To the contrary: The conservative Project 2025 agenda for the next administration calls for abolishing the Economic Development Administration—a focal point of the Biden-Harris administration’s awards to regions—and reallocating its funding to other priorities.
And yet, with that said, murmurings on Capitol Hill continue to suggest that there could be bipartisan investment in place-based programs like the Tech Hubs in the next administration, regardless of who wins the election. The investment would likely be oriented toward technology scale-up on topics like AI that are vital to the China competition.
In any event, the election will likely greatly affect the scope of the next phase of place-based policy in the U.S. While a Harris administration would likely seek to extend the experiment, Trump might well let the experiment peter out, with only a few exceptions.
Given that, the stakes are high as the nation continues to test new “place-based” programs to counter the regional inequality that continues to divide the nation.
For the first time in several generations, the nation has on the table sizable new tools for addressing the stubborn economic problems that wrack the scores of local communities following deindustrialization."

79,Biden and Netanyahu: A crisis in perspective,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/biden-and-netanyahu-a-crisis-in-perspective/,Itamar Rabinovich,"April 2, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"The Biden administration’s decision on March 25 not to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a cease-fire in Gaza brought the tension between the Biden administration and the Netanyahu government to a new high. On October 7 after Hamas’s horrific terrorist attack, the administration, and President Joe Biden personally, extended remarkable support to Israel, but as the war lingered (it will soon reach the six-month mark) significant disagreements emerged. They have to do with issues ranging from the war’s end, “the day after,” and the geopolitics of the Middle East, to the acute humanitarian crisis in Gaza and Israel’s prospective attack on Hamas’s remaining forces in Rafah, where over a million displaced people are currently sheltering.
Underlying the policy differences is the bad personal relationship between Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu, and Netanyahu’s calculated willingness to confront rather than accommodate his American counterpart. This was a strident reversal of Israeli prime ministers’ long-held tradition to avoid head-on collisions with U.S. presidents. Netanyahu first collided with former President Barack Obama and has taken it further with Biden during the past few months. Biden has been critical of Netanyahu and his extreme right-wing coalition since the formation of the latter’s current government. Biden viewed Netanyahu’s “judicial reform” as an attack on Israel’s democratic system and refused to invite him to Washington. They finally met in New York around the U.N. General Assembly in September 2023 and discussed, among other things, Biden’s quest to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel in tandem with the upgrading of the U.S.-Saudi relationship. Given Russia, China, and Iran’s challenge to the U.S. position in the Middle East, Saudi-Israeli normalization would be a crucial step in the formation of a pro-American bloc of moderate Arab states and Israel.
These issues were temporarily overshadowed by the events of October 7. But as the war unfolded, the same issues returned to the agenda, modified by the war. In the Biden administration’s view, after the war’s end, Gaza, following a transitional period, should be governed and administered by a revitalized and reformed Palestinian Authority (PA). Israel and the PA should then resume negotiations on a final status solution culminating in a two-state solution. This should enable the Saudis and the Emiratis to finance Gaza’s reconstruction and for the Saudis to normalize their relations with Israel. The role played by Iran’s proxies in the Israel-Hamas war served to highlight the need to construct that pro-Western anti-Iranian coalition. This vision is unacceptable to Netanyahu, who knows that his right-wing partners would topple his government if he accepted the two-state solution formula.
Contextualizing today’s crisis
This crisis’s significance should be seen against the backdrop of several earlier crises in the U.S.-Israeli relationship.
In 1957, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower’s administration forced Israel to withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula in the aftermath of the Suez-Sinai campaign. Israel’s leader, David Ben-Gurion, capitulated to U.S. pressure and agreed to withdraw in return for arrangements made for the Sinai and Israel’s freedom of passage in the Straits of Tiran, a gateway to Israel’s Port of Eilat, on the Red Sea.
In 1962-1963, President John. F. Kennedy exerted massive pressure on Ben-Gurion’s government over Washington’s suspicions that Israel was developing nuclear weapons in the southern town of Dimona. The pressures were tacit but consequential. The nuclear issue as such remained on the U.S.-Israeli agenda until a mutually acceptable formula was worked out with President Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger in the early 1970s.
In 1973, following the initial setback sustained by Israel during the Egyptian-Syrian attack on October 6, the United States, after a short delay, provided Israel with massive military aid and diplomatic support. By October 22 that year, the United States, pressured by the Soviet Union and Arab states, began to insist that Israel agree to a cease-fire and refrain from completely destroying the Egyptian army. Alongside the Soviet and Arab concerns, Kissinger wanted to avoid a complete Egyptian defeat, allowing Cairo to transition from war to negotiations from a position of strength. This created tension in the American-Israeli relationship but in retrospect, Israelis came to realize the benefits of U.S. policies that laid the foundations for a peace process that culminated six years later in the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.
In 1974-1975, Kissinger conducted his shuttle diplomacy which led to cease-fire and disengagement agreements between Israel, Egypt, and Syria and to the Israeli-Egyptian interim agreement of September 1975. During these negotiations, tension arose several times between Kissinger and the Israeli negotiators over concessions that Israel had to make. The most acute crisis in this series of disagreements occurred in 1975 between Kissinger and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. In the course of that crisis, President Gerald Ford, at Kissinger’s request, announced “a reassessment” of U.S.-Israeli relations, after which Rabin accepted most of Kissinger’s demands and a significant agreement with Egypt was eventually signed.
In January 1977, President Jimmy Carter launched an ambitious quest to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict in cooperation with the Soviet Union. His policy envisaged Arab-Israeli peace in return for a full Israeli withdrawal from the territories it captured in 1967 and the establishment of a Palestinian state. This led to a head-on collision between Carter and Rabin. A few months later, Menachem Begin was elected as Israel’s prime minister at the head of a right-wing government. He was bitterly opposed to Carter’s policies but so was Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, and the two ended up reaching an agreement on what became the first Arab-Israeli peace treaty outside of Carter’s framework. After an initially cold response to this new trend, the Carter administration endorsed the Egyptian-Israeli dialogue and brought it to fruition at the Camp David summit in September 1978. The process of negotiating the agreement and subsequently implementing the Palestinian dimension of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty led to repeated Israeli-American frictions, but these did not develop into a major crisis.
In its final years, the administration of President George H.W. Bush and James Baker, his secretary of state, sought to promote an Israeli-Palestinian agreement. The administration was openly critical of the Yitzhak Shamir government’s failure to respond to its initiatives and to Israel’s policy of building new settlements in the West Bank. The policy’s practical aspect was Bush’s refusal to approve $10 billion in loan guarantees to Israel designated to help integrate the new wave of Russian-Jewish immigration. Shamir’s failure to manage his relationship with the Bush administration partly explains his defeat by Rabin in the parliamentary elections in 1992.
Rabin’s second term, coming back to power after Shamir, set the stage for the most optimistic period in the effort to formulate and implement a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace process. This occurred during the final months of the George H.W. Bush administration and during Bill Clinton’s presidency. Under Rabin, his successor Shimon Peres, and later Ehud Barak, all of whom wanted to move the peace process forward, close cooperation with the United States was common, despite occasional disagreements over tactical issues.
Obama’s presidency and Netanyahu’s return to power coincided in early 2009, and it led to profound and open disagreements over both the Palestinian issue and Iran’s quest for nuclear weapons. Obama was determined to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and successfully pressured Netanyahu to publicly accept the notion of a two-state solution, which he did in a speech at Bar Ilan University. However, they ended up in a public and bitter disagreement, which culminated in Netanyahu’s decision to criticize Obama’s policy toward Iran in a speech to a joint session of Congress in March 2015. This did not prevent the signing of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, but after Donald Trump’s election to the presidency, Netanyahu played a role in his decision to withdraw from it.
Netanyahu’s decision to take on the U.S. president in Congress represented a sharp change in the paradigm mentioned above. Unlike most of his predecessors, Netanyahu did not mind openly quarreling with the president of the United States, but actually saw a political advantage in it and was not penalized by Israeli public opinion for it. In the United States, however, Netanyahu’s policies led to the perception that Israel had abandoned its policy of bipartisanship in American politics and shifted toward reliance on the Republican Party. This resulted in significant criticism of Israel in the Democratic ranks.
What makes today’s crisis different
Against this backdrop, the current crisis in the U.S.-Israeli relationship is very severe. It is reminiscent of the October War’s end in 1973, when a U.S. administration, having helped Israel transform an initial setback into a victory, sought to use the war’s ambiguous outcome as the starting point for transformative regional diplomacy. But a similar transition from war to a new diplomatic order is currently not in the cards.
Washington and Jerusalem’s profound policy differences are compounded by Biden and Netanyahu’s negative personal relationship. The Biden administration seems to believe that a change in government and prime minister in Israel is essential for the conduct of effective U.S. policy and a shift to a new regional order. Netanyahu, in turn, is clearly interested in an open confrontation with Biden, regarding it as an asset in his quest to survive Israel’s domestic political crisis. Worse, both parties are now openly interfering in each other’s domestic politics. Netanyahu abandoned a long-standing policy of working with both sides of the aisle and is leaning heavily on the Republicans, while Biden and his allies openly or implicitly express an expectation to see a new prime minister and government in Israel."

81,"South Africa, AGOA, and nonalignment",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/south-africa-agoa-and-nonalignment/,Witney Schneidman,"April 17, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"In 1998, flanked by U.S. President Bill Clinton and with Table Mountain looming in the background, South African President Nelson Mandela (after warmly welcoming the American president) used the opportunity of his first joint press conference with a U.S. president on South African soil to defend the country’s right to maintain positive relations with Libya, Cuba, and Iran.
Thirty minutes later, while taking a question from the media on the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and the “large number of conditionality clauses” it included, President Mandela acknowledged that his administration had “serious reservations” about the proposed legislation and that it was “not acceptable.”
Twenty-six years later, differences between Pretoria and Washington have once again raised questions about South Africa’s involvement in AGOA. The current imbroglio is enflamed by perceptions that South Africa has abandoned its traditional policy of nonalignment which, in the view of some in Congress, could justify its exclusion from the program."
82,Gloom about the ‘day after’ the Gaza war pervasive among Mideast scholars,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/gloom-about-the-day-after-the-gaza-war-pervasive-among-mideast-scholars/,"Marc Lynch, Shibley Telhami","June 20, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Even before a lasting ceasefire in the Gaza Strip could be attained, the Biden administration has avowed the need to return to the eventual goal of a two-state solution as the foundation of a durable Israeli-Palestinian settlement. But a new survey of Middle East scholars who study the issue suggests that finding such a solution out of the horrific devastation of Gaza is highly unlikely.
The latest round of the Middle East Scholar Barometer that we co-direct, with over 750 mostly U.S.-based respondents, reveals that few scholars believe that advancing a two-state solution in the foreseeable future is a realistic option, and a large majority believe that war in Israel and Gaza is likely to lead to new large-scale, long-term displacement of Palestinians from Gaza and/or the West Bank. The Biden administration’s policy gets failing grades from the scholars: More than three-quarters say President Joe Biden’s policy negatively impacts the prospects of peace in Israel and Palestine, U.S. interests in the Middle East, and America’s standing in the world.
This unique survey probes opinions on timely issues of Middle East experts from the American Political Science Association, the Project on Middle East Political Science, the American Historical Association, and the Middle East Studies Association (MESA), which we have been conducting on a biannual basis for more than three years. Most of our list and our respondents are political scientists, as are the two of us and the six-member advisory committee. The latest round was conducted from May 23 to June 6. Notably, we found few significant differences between MESA members and those who are not, and between political scientists and other scholars, suggesting that the scholars’ views are not on the whole dependent on their academic discipline or their organizational membership. As we have recently reported in the Chronicle of Higher Education, over 80% of U.S. based scholars say they self-censor when discussing the Israeli-Palestinian issue professionally, mostly speech critical of Israel.
The nature of the war in Gaza and Israeli aims
Nearly three-quarters of the scholars surveyed, about 72%, expect the war to result in new mass displacements of Palestinians outside of Gaza and the West Bank. This expectation seems partly based on the scholars’ gloomy assessment of Israel’s motives: A majority, about 57%, see making Gaza uninhabitable in order to force Palestinian removal as a primary Israeli objective of the war. About 15% each see Israel’s primary objective to be keeping the current Israeli government in office or destroying Hamas. Few (about 4%) say Israel’s operation is justified by the right of self-defense."
83,Meeting Israelis’ demand for change and accountability,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/meeting-israelis-demand-for-change-and-accountability/,Marvin Kalb,"May 6, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"So far, only one Israeli senior officer, Aharon Haliva, the chief of Israeli military intelligence, has resigned, accepting personal responsibility for what he called the “black day” of October 7, when Hamas attacked Israel, brutally killing 1,200 Israelis and seizing 253 hostages. Throughout Israel’s continuing confrontation with Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and, most significantly, Iran, no other Israeli officer or official with responsibility for the stunning Israeli security and intelligence failures on October 7 has resigned or been held accountable.
One might have expected if not resignations then at least explanations for the failures. But none has been forthcoming—there have been no meaningful explanations from Defense Minister Yoav Gallant or Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In fact, while Gallant accepted responsibility for failing to stop Hamas’s attack on October 7, Netanyahu, who bears the ultimate responsibility for the shameful collapse of Israeli security, has so far hidden behind escapist rhetoric about some kind of postwar reckoning—but not now, he stresses, not during the war. A number of Netanyahu critics, including journalist Anshel Pfeffer, who wrote a biography of Netanyahu, have suggested that the prime minister has been more absorbed in this war with his personal and political survival than with Israel’s security.
Seven months into what seems like an endless war, Israelis have become increasingly uncertain about their future, and they have still not been provided with a satisfactory explanation of why October 7 happened and who is responsible.
Lessons from 1973
One possible path forward can be found by looking back to the events of 1973, 50 years and one day prior to October 7, 2023. Half a century ago, on October 6, 1973, Egypt and Syria took advantage of the Yom Kippur holiday to launch a surprise attack on Israel, leaving it for a while in alarming disarray. There had been warnings of an imminent Arab attack, but they were foolishly ignored. Even Defense Minister Moshe Dayan, an Israeli hero, wondered if Israel would survive. But, once again, like in the present crisis, the United States came to Israel’s rescue. President Richard Nixon ordered emergency shipments of military supplies. Israel, reinvigorated, counterattacked and not only survived but prevailed.
But then, like now, Israelis were saddled with the agonizing question, who was responsible for this near disaster? Prime Minister Golda Meir, unlike the current prime minister, accepted that Israelis deserved an answer. On November 21, 1973, she established the Agranat Commission of Inquiry to investigate the glaring failures in Israeli intelligence and military preparedness for the 1973 war. The commission was limited by design: it was not to examine Israel’s political leadership, only its military leadership. Still, it functioned by reviewing strategy and interviewing key personnel. Led by Shimon Agranat, chief justice of Israel’s Supreme Court, it produced a final report, placing blame for Israel’s failure of military preparedness on the chief of military intelligence, Eli Zeira, and the chief of staff, David Elazar, both of whom immediately resigned. Months earlier, Meir and Dayan had also resigned, accepting responsibility for their roles in the 1973 war.
The commission served two important public services: it explored how the intelligence and military failures happened and how the risk of a repeated failure might be mitigated, and it produced a measurable degree of official accountability, which the Israeli people had demanded and deserved.
A cry for accountability
Of course, history follows no exact libretto, but Israelis are again demanding accountability and an explanation for the obvious political and intelligence failures that led to the October 7 calamity. So far, for different reasons, there has been no sign that Netanyahu will follow in Meir’s controversial footsteps. He has refused to resign. No national commission has been organized. Nor have national elections for a possible change in government been announced, even though Benny Gantz, a moderate member of Netanyahu’s war cabinet, has raised the possibility of elections this fall. So too in a stronger voice has Yair Lapid, a prominent anti-Netanyahu politician.
The Israeli people have been demanding some degree of political accountability for this war without end, and, with even more force, they’ve been screaming for the release of the more than 100 family members still being held hostage by a hostile Hamas. Elections are one form of accountability; a national commission is another.
But in the immediate future, Israel’s destiny lies in the hands of a prime minister who continues to pretend that he doesn’t hear the people’s cry for accountability. His political future appears to depend on the continuing cohesiveness of his ruling coalition. Should it crack apart under increasing public pressure, a major change in the Israeli government is certain. But should it somehow hold together, the streets and squares of Israel will again be crowded with angry, disappointed, and frustrated protesters, demanding, among other things, a return of hostages, accountability for October 7, and a change in government."
84,Sizing and seizing Washington’s $40 billion down payment on place-based industrial policy,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/sizing-and-seizing-washingtons-40-billion-down-payment-on-place-based-industrial-policy/,"Glencora Haskins, Joseph Parilla","December 3, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",RESEARCH,"Though President Biden and Vice President Harris are leaving office in January, the ramifications of four pieces of economic legislation the Biden-Harris administration passed with the 117th Congress will continue to impact local economies across the country.  
The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) signified a new federal commitment to building the productive capacity of the nation—and importantly all its regions—to respond to global geopolitical competition, the ongoing threat of climate change, and economic inequities that have left many people and places behind. 
Those three objectives—national security, energy abundance, and place-based economic opportunity—uniquely converge in a nearly $80 billion portfolio of “place-based industrial policies” authorized by these major bills. A prior Brookings Metro report selected place-based industrial policies using a two-part definition, requiring that such strategies should:  
Encourage economic transformation through interventions in key industries 
Explicitly leverage concentrations of talent, suppliers, and knowledge that cluster and interact in place to spur development 
This brief offers a first-of-its-kind analysis of the technological, geographic, and socioeconomic footprint of public investments flowing from place-based industrial programs. It finds that:  
Nearly $41 billion has been awarded across 13 programs, which are distributing funding via two mechanisms: company-level investment incentives (94%) and coalition-based economic development grants (6%).  
Technologically, most of the funding has targeted three strategic sectors—semiconductors, batteries, and clean energy— primarily through these company-level investment incentives.  
Geographically, place-based investments are landing in 50 states, but total funding is relatively concentrated. The top 10 recipient labor market areas (LMAs) have been awarded more than three-quarters of the overall funding.  
Economically, coalition-based economic development grants were more likely to award funding to employment-distressed communities rather than company-level incentives.  
Going forward, government, industry, and community actors all have a role in maximizing the economic benefits of this place-based industrial policy agenda. In Washington, Congress can finish the job it started by fully funding key aspects of this portfolio, including the $17 billion in authorized but unappropriated funds for the National Science Foundation (NSF) Regional Innovation Engines program (Engines), the Economic Development Administration (EDA) Regional Technology and Innovation Hubs program (Tech Hubs), and the EDA’s Recompete Pilot Program (Recompete). Yet there is considerable political uncertainty around future funding.  
Acknowledging that, the ultimate economic outcomes of this $41 billion investment will be determined in dozens of cities, metropolitan areas, and rural communities across the country. So we conclude the brief with clear implications for implementers, investors, and evaluators that want to co-invest in this generational economic development opportunity.

85,Freedom—Harris’s message to America,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/freedom-harriss-message-to-america/,"Elaine Kamarck, William A. Galston","August 23, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"In their 2024 national convention, Democrats reclaimed the mantle of freedom.
The first indication was Vice President Harris’s choice of Beyoncé’s song “Freedom” as her campaign anthem. It has been playing at her rallies and it played at the end of the film before her entrance onto the stage. In addition to placards that said, “Thank you Joe” or “Vote” or “Coach Walz,” the DNC had thousands of placards printed for the delegates to wave that simply read, “Freedom.” Many of the convention speeches invoked the term in some way. Governor Walz’s acceptance speech for the vice presidency was especially heavy on it:
“Freedom. When Republicans use the word freedom, they mean that the government should be free to invade your doctor’s office. Corporations—free to pollute your air and water. And banks—free to take advantage of customers.
“But when we Democrats talk about freedom, we mean the freedom to make a better life for yourself and the people that you love. Freedom to make your own health care decisions. And yeah, your kids’ freedom to go to school without worrying about being shot dead in the hall.”
Nothing is as central to America’s cultural DNA as freedom. After all, we as a nation were born out of a desire for freedom from King George.
One of the seminal speeches of the 20th century was President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s 1941 State of the Union address. In it, he announced what he called the “Four Freedoms”—freedom of speech and expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear—principles that were incorporated into the war aims of the Allied Powers, and eventually into the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
A generation later, the Civil Rights Movement marched for freedom from the oppression of segregation and unequal citizenship, goals that the modern Democratic Party embraced. After the Roe v. Wade decision was handed down in 1973, Democrats defended women’s freedom to choose against conservative attempts to restrict access to abortion, and even to prohibit it nationwide.
Since the 1980s, however, Republicans claimed freedom for themselves; starting with the presidency of Republican Ronald Reagan, they narrowed it to mean free markets and limited government. This redefinition rested on the argument that government represented the main threat to freedom, which is at best a half-truth. Yes, government can become oppressive. But weak government can also pose a threat to freedom. Citizens cannot live free from fear unless government minimizes threats to the security of persons and property as citizens act within the structure of law. They cannot enjoy freedom from want unless government protects markets from force, fraud, and threats to competition, and unless it protects individuals from economic privation. In his 1944 State of the Union, FDR declared: “Necessitous men are not free men. Men who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.”
Despite the power of such arguments, modern Democrats have found it difficult to persuade the electorate that they were champions of freedom. And then in 2022, the Supreme Court handed down the Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade and jeopardized women’s freedom of choice across the nation. The reaction has been striking; with one decision, the government was suddenly in the middle of the most personal decisions women and men could make.
Since then, not a month has passed without a story making national news about a woman denied abortion care that could save her life and/or her fertility. On stage at the Democratic convention, some of these women told their heartbreaking stories. Since then, abortion has been on the ballot in seven states—many of which, like Kansas and Kentucky, are conservative, deep red states. And in every single instance, the pro-choice position won. Since then, abortion has played a major role in the Virginia legislative elections, the congressional midterm elections, and many special elections. In 2024, abortion referendums will be on the ballot in eight states, two of which, Arizona and Nevada, are swing states and where the issue may very well bring out young Democratic voters. 
Against this backdrop, it’s not surprising that Harris’s speech spent more time on abortion than any other single policy issue. Her unique ability to prosecute this issue was evident back when she was a senator from California who asked then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh if he could think of a law that controlled men’s bodies. In addition to warning the country about Republican plans to take away reproductive freedom by enacting a national abortion ban and installing a national anti-abortion coordinator in the White House, Harris expanded on threats to freedoms.
“In this election, many other fundamental freedoms are at stake. The freedom to live safe from gun violence—in our schools, communities, and places of worship. The freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. The freedom to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis. And the freedom that unlocks all the others. The freedom to vote.”
Beyond the articulation of a freedom agenda, the speech had other tasks, which Harris crisply carried out. She introduced herself to the country as a child of a middle-class family and declared that building a strong middle class would be one of the defining purposes of her administration. To that end, she advanced her vision of an “opportunity economy” where everyone would have a chance to compete and where success for some need not mean failure for others. 
Harris took on inflation and immigration, two areas of potential vulnerability for her campaign. She promised to bring down prices of everyday goods and services and to attack the nation’s housing crisis. On immigration, she sought to turn the tables on Donald Trump, reminding her audience that he had subverted a bipartisan reform bill that would have helped secure the border.
Surprising some observers, Harris laid out a tough agenda on defense and foreign policy, promising to maintain the strongest and most lethal fighting force in the world, retain our leading position in NATO, defend Ukraine against Russian aggression, stand up against Iran and North Korea, and take democracy’s side in the struggle with tyranny. She articulated a firm pro-Israel stance while mentioning the suffering of Gaza’s inhabitants and endorsing Palestinians’ right to dignity and self-determination.
Taken as a whole, Harris’s acceptance speech positioned her as a center-left Democrat in the mold of Joe Biden rather than Bernie Sanders. It embraced what she termed the pride and privilege of being an American. And as if to show that Republicans have not cornered the market on patriotism and American exceptionalism, she told her audience that together, they had the opportunity to write the next chapter of the most extraordinary story ever told. She ended her speech in the most traditional way imaginable, by asking God to bless the United States of America.
Harris’s speech, which the convention received with unfeigned enthusiasm, did nothing to interrupt the momentum of one of the most explosive campaign launches in American history."

87,Putin and Kim are creating a crisis—Can the US and China rein them in?,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/putin-and-kim-are-creating-a-crisis/,Patricia M. Kim,"June 21, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"The newly inked Russia-North Korea security pact has spiked anxiety around the world about Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s growing partnership and its implications for the Korean Peninsula, Ukraine, and beyond. While some have pointed to the past week’s developments as more evidence of a hardening “alignment of evil” that includes Russia, North Korea, China, and Iran, the reality is that the pact might do more to fracture than solidify any burgeoning axis.
With regional tensions rising, history could very well repeat itself: China could be drawn into a crisis or even a full-blown war on the Korean Peninsula that it has no interest in fighting, be left to clean up the mess given Moscow’s preoccupation in Europe, and suffer major setbacks to its actual priorities as a result. 
China’s top objectives for the Korean Peninsula—no crisis or chaos—are actually more in line with the interests of Washington and its allies than with Pyongyang and Moscow. Before a crisis strikes, the United States and China, along with South Korea and other regional stakeholders, should work together to rein in the Putin-Kim collaboration and revamp diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula.
North Korea emboldened
The newly signed Russia-North Korea security pact is deliberately ambiguous by design. The text states that the two sides will provide “military and other assistance with all means in its possession without delay” if one party falls into a “state of war” due to an “armed invasion” by one or more countries.  This raises the question of what counts as a “state of war” and the threshold that would need to be met for the mutual security clause to be triggered. Furthermore, the type of support to be rendered by either party is left quite open—“military and other assistance” could refer to anything from intelligence sharing to sending troops on the ground.
This ambiguity is likely intended to keep the United States and its allies uncertain about what might trigger the mutual defense clause and to instill caution as a result. And the vague wording on the types of assistance also gives Pyongyang and Moscow flexibility in their obligations to one another. It’s also quite possible that Moscow and Pyongyang have different interpretations and expectations of what they’ve promised each other.
Nevertheless, a grave concern is that with a Russian “security guarantee” or at least the facade of one in hand, North Korea may be emboldened to intensify its provocations based on the calculation that the United States and its allies will respond with greater caution now that they have to take a potential Russian reaction into account.
Putin unlikely to restrain Kim
Even more concerning is that Moscow has little incentive to restrain its junior partner from engaging in actions that destabilize Northeast Asia. In fact, Putin could very well welcome a North Korean provocation on the Korean Peninsula that forces the United States to turn its attention away from Europe, where Russia is continuing its relentless war against Ukraine.
It’s also conceivable that Russia and North Korea—both of whom have much to gain from another Trump presidency—might initiate an “October surprise” in an attempt to tilt the U.S. presidential elections in Trump’s favor. After all, the former president has openly expressed fondness for both Kim and Putin. Trump has also suggested that he would strike a deal with Pyongyang that allows it to keep its nuclear weapons and that he would cut U.S. aid to Ukraine immediately upon election.
Chinese, Russian, and North Korean interests diverge
These developments have rattled not just the United States and its allies, but also China. Beijing is rapidly losing its influence with Pyongyang relative to Moscow, all the while paying the diplomatic costs of being associated with the two pariah states.
To be sure, Beijing, Moscow, and Pyongyang share deep grievances about what they see as a U.S.-dominated global order. All three seek to erode Washington’s power and influence. But a key difference between Beijing and its two partners is that it seeks to achieve such an end without setting the world on fire or completely derailing its profitable ties with the world’s developed countries.
China needs a stable environment to deal with its myriad economic challenges at home and to manage trade tensions and de-risking efforts by Western states. China wants to move up the technology and innovation ladder and accelerate its military modernization, which Beijing believes is essential for compelling unification with Taiwan. In contrast, neither Russia nor North Korea has promising economic prospects or believes it benefits from a stable global order. This is why both countries have exclusively embraced violently disrupting the status quo.
In private conversations, Chinese observers, like their South Korean and American counterparts, express concerns about their lack of visibility on the military technology transfers being made between Russia and North Korea and the short- to long-term consequences of such transfers. They also share fears that Putin may be encouraging Kim to take destabilizing actions to distract the United States, raising the risk of war on China’s doorstep.
The last thing Beijing wants is U.S. attention shifted from Europe to Asia. Beijing is already uncomfortable and incensed by enhanced nuclear coordination between the United States and the Republic of Korea (ROK), deepening U.S.-ROK-Japan trilateral cooperation, and the many other steps the Biden administration has taken to strengthen alliance cooperation and deterrence in the region.
China left holding the bag?
China may soon find itself paying the costs of North Korean adventurism like it did at the beginning of the Cold War when the newly established People’s Republic of China (PRC), encouraged by Moscow to advance the communist cause in Asia, agreed to support the North Korean regime next door. Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Un’s grandfather, gladly took advantage of Soviet and Chinese backing to pursue his ambitions of absorbing the entire Korean Peninsula. He kicked off the first hot conflict of the Cold War which led to the death of an estimated five million civilians and soldiers, including hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops.
This was at a time when the Chinese communists faced the urgent task of consolidating their rule at home and rebuilding China’s war-torn economy. Instead, they were forced to pivot their attention to the Korean Peninsula and direct almost half of their state budget to military spending. Mao Zedong also lost an opportunity to invade Taiwan—a goal that continues to elude Beijing today—after the United States sent the 7th Fleet to neutralize the Taiwan Strait.
To add insult to injury, the Chinese counted on Soviet air cover and weapons as part of their agreement with Moscow to help the North Koreans. But Josef Stalin waffled on his commitments at critical moments and the burden of assisting the North Koreans fell heavily on Beijing’s shoulders.
While the PRC then is not the same as the PRC today, and the power dynamics among all of the states have shifted, Russian and North Korean collusion has never played out favorably for China.
The case for U.S.-China coordination
The United States, China, ROK, Japan, and virtually every other state in the region seeks stability, peace, and the ultimate elimination of the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. There’s a strong case for collaboration before the Russian-North Korean partnership takes the region further away from these objectives.
The world is facing conflicts in Europe and the Middle East. The fact that Washington and Beijing have not been able to work together on these conflicts and are often at cross-purposes raises the question of how one might expect U.S.-China cooperation on the Korean Peninsula.
Yet the brewing crisis in Northeast Asia is different: there’s so much more at stake for China’s direct security interests, as well as those of the United States and its closest Asian allies.  Perhaps most disturbing for Beijing is that while it may be able to control escalation dynamics in the Taiwan Strait or in the South China Sea as a direct party in the conflicts, it can’t say the same for Russian-backed North Korean adventurism.
Enhanced U.S.-ROK-Japan military deterrence is necessary but insufficient to meet the growing challenge posed by Russia and North Korea’s alignment. It will also take clear and credible threats and assurances from the United States and China to shape Pyongyang and Moscow’s behavior. Collaboration doesn’t suggest that all steps, if any, need to be taken jointly. After all, Washington and Beijing have different relationships and points of leverage with North Korea and Russia. But quiet discussions on how the two sides might signal redlines and revamp a dead diplomatic process that neutralizes the threat posed by North Korea are in urgent order."

While local stakeholders and environmental advocacy groups have long pushed for sustained investment in climate-resilient infrastructure and the built environment, few federal resources have been available—leaving communities across the U.S. to pick up the tab for crumbling roads and bridges, water and sewer system failures, and the significant environmental, socioeconomic, and public health impacts of degrading public spaces. In the American Society of Civil Engineers’ 2021 report card of U.S. infrastructure, the estimated cost of this disinvestment topped $2.6 trillion.  
Addressing this funding gap has been one of the top priorities of the Biden-Harris administration’s Investing in America agenda, most clearly exemplified through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Yet, the American Rescue Plan Act’s (ARPA) State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) program has also been a uniquely flexible source for local governments to invest in infrastructure. This analysis shows that in making these investments, large local governments are not only advancing their goals of obligating their SLFRF allocations ahead of the December 2024 deadline, but they are doing so in ways that strengthen their built environment, create economic opportunity, and redress past environmental injustices.

89,Accelerating the clean energy revolution by working with China,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/accelerating-the-clean-energy-revolution-by-working-with-china/,"David G. Victor, Michael R. Davidson","June 18, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"It has become axiomatic in Washington that America must get tough on China. This is evident in clean energy, an industry that is critical to the future, where Chinese suppliers are treated as existential threats rather than vital to America’s success.
This approach will backfire. America is already lagging behind China in important ways. Collaboration and competition, not hostility, are how we can catch up to the world’s largest supplier of clean technology products. Big tariffs and barriers to Chinese firms doing business in the United States will undermine that strategy. These anti-Chinese policies are already making it harder for American firms to stay abreast of the world’s best innovations and redefine the technological frontier with their own ideas. In the end, isolating ourselves from China won’t just fail—it will also harm American companies, workers, and innovators. Moreover, it will drive up the cost of green technology, making it even harder to clean up the world’s energy system.
U.S. strategy should help American companies compete at the frontier while avoiding excess dependence on China. Success requires understanding how China became so dominant in so many clean technologies and how trade and investment can help American industry, workers, and communities thrive as well.
Understanding China’s dominance—and our dependency
There is no question that the world has become too dependent on China, especially in the raw ingredients of the clean energy economy. China refines 60% of the world’s lithium and nearly 90% of rare earth metals (used in magnets for motors and generators such as on wind turbines). Demand for such minerals will soar as the clean energy revolution advances.
The big opportunities in competition and collaboration aren’t in ingredients but in products—the place where China is really excelling through innovation and excellence in design and manufacturing. Chinese battery and solar producers are world-class—they operate and, increasingly, define the global frontier. Their competitiveness comes from manufacturing innovations geared to producing huge volumes with minimal cost and defects. For example, the leading Chinese producers have all automated battery and electric vehicle production lines because human workers can’t assure quality except when they manage robots rather than compete with them. If defects spoil just a few percent of batteries, for example, a plant can’t compete with the world’s best. In fact, Chinese factories are often more automated than their Western competitors, because the Chinese gear is newer.
Understanding how China got so dominant is the key to crafting an American strategy. Chinese industrial policy, including big subsidies, set a foundation for leaps in productivity. Local governments in China have attracted firms and entrepreneurs through lucrative tax breaks and other benefits like free land and expedited approvals to build facilities—policies that can be highly effective in creating local industrial ecosystems that attract still more firms in complementary industries. Competition in clean energy technologies is fierce inside China and spilling into other markets (e.g., robots to supply car manufacturers); as China gets more competitive, there have been ripple effects globally as other firms, such as Tesla, have been forced to slash margins in some markets and deliver better value to customers. These local subsidies create advantages, but China is hardly alone in adopting those policies. Industrial location incentives, mainly in the form of tax breaks, are widespread in the United States. And at the federal level, the United States has its own industrial policy—centered on the Inflation Reduction Act and other federal legislation with hefty spending.
Responding to Chinese dominance
A strategy that gains from trade with China isn’t the same as throwing open the border to crushing competition, but the right way to respond to Chinese dominance isn’t with extensive tariffs—Washington’s bipartisan strategy. Donald Trump called in March for a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles, and the Biden administration more or less implemented what Trump wanted last month. The administration is also readying still more tariffs and retaliation.
There’s certainly a role for tariffs, especially when countries use dominant positions and a history of hefty subsidies to dump products on global markets—actions that undermine competition in many ways, including the extinction of rival firms allowing for monopolistic behavior. But the United States has allowed that proper role to spiral beyond control with huge tariffs that apply across whole industries. A much narrower approach to tariff retaliation—along with one that follows the rules of the World Trade Organization, where the United States has also been unhelpfully obstructionist—would be much smarter.
Tariffs harm the United States in two ways. First, by driving up the cost of Chinese imports, tariffs make it harder for anyone who wants to use solar panels or batteries to reduce emissions. Along the way, these tariffs temporarily make some American firms more profitable, but the main effect so far has been to encourage Chinese firms to relocate their supply chains—first to Southeast Asia and now globally. Second, and more perniciously, tariffs are politically destabilizing. As the United States attacks China’s supply chains, from Vietnam to Mexico, it undermines our trading relationships with important trading partners. And when China retaliates, trade wars over batteries and lithium metastasize to harm exports of other products, such as soybeans, where American producers have big advantages.
Even more shortsighted are the escalating barriers to Chinese firms investing in America. When Chinese firms partner with expert local American firms, both sides learn and local communities benefit from the investment and jobs. The United States learned that lesson when it faced the threat of competition from Japan around 1990—a dose of managed trade along with allowing (even encouraging) joint ventures created value here at home.
However, obstacles to this kind of productive collaboration abound in the United States. In the electric vehicle sector, for example, an opaquely applied rule known as the Foreign Entities of Concern, a wonky element of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), prohibits any enterprise with Chinese ownership greater than 25% or any control by Chinese managers from receiving U.S. subsidies. Nobody really knows how this will work, or even if the letter of the rule can be trusted. Many states are also piling in with their own legislation that wrongly targets Chinese residents and investors. The result: Chinese firms that could compete in one of the world’s largest clean energy markets are shunning America.
Getting industrial policy right
The ongoing subsidy race for clean technology has breathed life into climate policy ambitions. Yet subsidy-rich industrial policies face both fiscal and political limits, blunt the power of markets, and cause friction with our closest clean tech trading partners. We have a common interest in focusing industrial policies in areas where markets have failed, such as in encouraging adequate investment in innovation and the demonstration of early-stage technologies. (By that standard, the IRA’s role still has a way to go.)
Many of those opportunities for innovation would benefit from U.S.-Chinese collaboration, including academic collaboration. Tentative early signs of a possible U.S.-China thaw have included pledges for advanced clean energy collaboration, like carbon capture, though they remain politically fragile in both countries. One benefit of a better U.S.-Chinese geopolitical relationship could be a forum where the two countries discuss paring back excessive subsidies—akin to what the United States, Europe, and other countries have done for decades in agriculture. On subsidy reform, the United States would be pushing, to some degree, on an open door in China. In the early years of the clean technology revolution, the Chinese central government backed Chinese industry with local content rules and an array of subsidies including loans from state-linked banks; much of that support is now unnecessary and starting to be rolled back.
We must diversify the global suppliers for the ingredients of a clean energy revolution. This will require international cooperation and using the market, not anti-China mandates. (The market is already delivering to some degree—recent lithium price volatility has prompted supply to expand, for example, mostly not in China.) We must also demand, as Europe already does, that Chinese supply chains meet the same environmental standards as those in the West. Chinese battery makers already know this and are putting in place the monitoring systems needed to comply.
It’s also important that we pay close attention to places where the Chinese government might manipulate supplies and undermine national security. Some manipulations are already evident in markets for graphite (used in batteries) and rare earths. The best way for America to secure its supply chains is to work alongside other countries that want greater security in critical minerals to encourage a diversity of global suppliers and monitor the market for abuses. Lithium isn’t the new oil; moving lithium supplies onshore, even if that were feasible, is a much less effective and more costly way to secure supplies. Furthermore, today’s “America First” approach all too easily leads to overreactions as every behavior from China gets treated as a national security threat.
Learning from China
Rather than erect barriers, we should emulate China’s approach. Through permitting reform—an area where nascent bipartisanship is making some headway—we should be cutting red tape on projects and plants. Solar panel factories, for example, are far smaller than China’s behemoth wafer, cell, and module factories. More and bigger plants offer huge gains from scale. Getting out of the way of—and even encouraging—U.S. communities to adopt newer Chinese manufacturing technologies and methods will also help push local firms to the global frontier.
The clean energy revolution is well underway and accelerating—in red and blue states alike. Gaining the most from this revolution requires that we quickly catch up to the global technological frontier by learning from—not locking out—Beijing."
90,Will the ICC issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Sinwar?,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/will-the-icc-issue-arrest-warrants-for-netanyahu-and-sinwar/,Kelebogile Zvobgo,"September 9, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"On May 20, International Criminal Court (ICC) Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan applied for arrest warrants for five atrocity crimes suspects in the Israel-Hamas war. They include Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant, and Hamas’s leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar. Israel reportedly killed two other Hamas leaders whom Khan had charged—Mohammed Deif, in an airstrike in Gaza, and Ismail Haniyeh, in a bombing in Iran, both in July. Hamas and Israel have denounced the request for warrants.
Khan’s application is based on evidence collected since the October 7 terrorist attacks—when Hamas massacred about 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage—and the start of Israel’s retaliatory military action in Gaza. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed since then, with hundreds of thousands of others displaced and facing starvation.
The investigation spans a decade, beginning in 2015 when the State of Palestine accepted the ICC’s jurisdiction over atrocity crimes (e.g., war crimes and crimes against humanity) in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) from June 13, 2014, onward. The State of Palestine, officially represented by the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), has been a “nonmember observer state” at the United Nations since 2012. This designation allows Palestine to join treaties like the ICC’s Rome Statute. There are two rival governments in Palestine: the Palestinian Authority (PA)—which speaks for the PLO, governs the West Bank, and initiated the ICC probe—and Hamas in Gaza. Hamas was briefly a part of the PA, after its 2006 general election win in Gaza and the West Bank, but splintered off when Fatah, a rival faction, refused to recognize the election results.
Because Hamas militants are ICC member nationals, they are liable for prosecution for atrocities committed in either Israel or Palestine; Israeli personnel, as nonmember nationals, are only liable for atrocities committed in Palestine.
Whether or not they ultimately lead to arrests, warrants matter, and Hamas’s and Israel’s allies shouldn’t attack the ICC for its findings. Doing so undermines international law and jeopardizes international justice for Israeli and Palestinian victims of atrocity crimes.
What are the allegations?
Khan’s filing asserts that Sinwar and Deif are criminally responsible for atrocities including murder, hostage taking, torture, and sexual violence since at least October 7, while Netanyahu and Gallant are criminally responsible for civilian targeting, wilful killing, and using the starvation of civilians as a weapon of war, among other crimes in Gaza since at least October 8. The “at least” language is important: Khan is focused on the current war, but he is also examining a broader range of abuses (potentially including genocide by Hamas and/or Israel) over a longer time frame. The U.S. Department of Justice has separately filed criminal charges against Hamas leaders.
Are the judges taking a long time?
There is no set time for ICC judges to deliberate, but they are taking longer in this case than they did with the last high-profile arrest warrants. In 2023, the judges took just three weeks to grant warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and one of his deputies for the unlawful deportation and transfer of Ukrainian children to Russia.
The judges may be taking more time for several reasons, including the number of perpetrators and violations, and the many amicus curiae observations (or briefs filed by outside advocates) that states and other groups have submitted for consideration. The judges also may want to decide on all the warrants before making an announcement. Consider this hypothetical: if the judges issue warrants for Hamas leaders first and do so for Israeli leaders at a later date, they could face two types of backlash—first, for appearing to be biased against Palestinians and, second, for seeming to capitulate to pressure to include Israelis. There will be backlash no matter what, but backlash on one front seems better than backlash on two fronts.
Do arrest warrants matter?
Judges can take months to issue warrants but they almost always accept the prosecutor’s requests (at least those we know about—some requests are made under seal). Warrants don’t always result in arrests, to be sure—but they still matter. They hold symbolic value, marking the accused as international pariahs and acknowledging victims’ suffering. Just the possibility of warrants makes it harder for allies to continue lending military and diplomatic aid. Foreign governments, like the U.K., have in recent weeks withdrawn aid they think Israel could use to violate international law.
Warrants also mean ICC members—124 countries—have a legal obligation to arrest suspects who enter their territory (per Article 59 of the Rome Statute) and to cooperate with court proceedings (per Article 86). But countries don’t always comply.
For example, South Africa failed to arrest former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir during a 2015 African Union summit in Johannesburg. But in 2023, President Cyril Ramaphosa agreed to not have Putin attend a BRICS summit in Johannesburg. Putin had threatened to declare war if Ramaphosa’s government tried to arrest him, but ultimately, the two leaders avoided a standoff.
Putin has traveled little outside Russia since the arrest warrant and only to ICC nonmembers like China, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan—until recently. ICC member Mongolia has drawn global criticism, including from the United States, for welcoming Putin to Ulaanbaatar on September 3.
What happens after arrest warrants are issued?
If warrants are issued, Hamas and Israeli leaders could dodge the court, like 20 other current defendants. They could also be arrested if they visit an ICC member country. Alternatively, they could surrender themselves, as did Uganda’s Dominic Ongwen (now in prison for atrocities he committed as a brigade commander in the Lord’s Resistance Army) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s Bosco Ntaganda (now in prison for atrocities he committed as a leader of the Patriotic Forces for the Liberation of Congo).
At this point, remaining at large (scenario one) seems most likely. To be arrested by an ICC member country (scenario two), Israeli and Hamas leaders would first have to travel there. Only if the suspects were likely to face worse punishment at home would they consider voluntarily surrendering (scenario three).
The blowback 
Israeli officials, U.S. President Joe Biden, and others have challenged what they see as a false moral equivalence in the charges against both Hamas and Israeli leaders. But the prosecutor’s job isn’t to make moral judgments; it’s to apply the law. This isn’t to say that the prosecutor isn’t political or doesn’t act strategically. For instance, the prosecutor’s office has in the past been accused of targeting offenders in African countries, ostensibly because the prosecutions seemed easier to conduct. (These claims are contested, however, even in Africa.) What matters most is that, within each country investigation, the prosecutor is even-handed.
Hamas enacted unspeakable violence on October 7 and militants should be held criminally accountable. But this doesn’t give Israel a blank check to commit atrocities to secure itself and bring the hostages home. Israeli personnel should also be held accountable.
Some commentators assert that warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant will make peace harder to achieve but others challenge the “peace versus justice” assumption underlying such claims. The ICC can make negotiations more complicated, but it doesn’t necessarily make negotiations less productive. Other commentators have proposed that the arrest warrant request could help end the war and encourage Israelis to oust Netanyahu’s government, which is very unpopular.
However, the Israeli government isn’t going down without a fight and has threatened to punish Palestinians if the ICC issues warrants. The United States has similarly threatened to withhold aid to Palestinians. But as international law expert Mark Kersten argues,
“There is no moral, legal or political justification for Israel’s allies punishing civilians for an investigation by the only credible, impartial and independent court investigating atrocities against Palestinian and Israeli victims of atrocity crimes.”
During his announcement, Khan made an oblique reference to attempted interference in his investigation and threatened legal action under Article 70 of the Rome Statute, which provides for fines and up to five years imprisonment for individuals who obstruct justice.
A week later, The Guardian reported that Israel has “deployed its intelligence agencies to surveil, hack, pressure, smear and allegedly threaten senior ICC staff in an effort to derail the court’s inquiries”—likely the actions Khan was referencing, though an Israeli spokesperson denied the allegations.
This wouldn’t be the first—or likely the last—time the ICC has faced intimidation. During the Trump administration, the United States levied sanctions against court officials, and it could do so again. Some lawmakers have warned, “Target Israel and we will target you.” But others have spoken out against such threats, including the White House.
Still, Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have called Khan’s actions “outrageous” and “shameful,” reinforcing the idea that the system is unfair. Israeli officials have gone a step further, accusing the ICC of antisemitic bias, echoing prior allegations of an anti-African bias.
These attacks are intended to undermine the ICC’s credibility and effectiveness—and they shouldn’t continue or be allowed to succeed. Opponents can instead offer legal arguments and evidence to challenge the court’s determinations. States that value the rule of law should make their case using the law—not ad hominem attacks, intimidation, or obstruction."

93,The Taliban’s three years in power and what lies ahead,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-talibans-three-years-in-power-and-what-lies-ahead/,Vanda Felbab-Brown,"August 14, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Three years on, the Taliban regime remains firmly in power. Its supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, has strengthened and centralized his rule by creating parallel institutions while formulating policies from his tightly-knit Kandahar office. The regime has become more exclusionary, privileging southern Pashtun Talibs. Despite massive economic challenges, including more than 90% of Afghans struggling with poverty and increasing food insecurity, the regime is not at immediate risk of an economic implosion.
Afghanistan’s neighbors, as well as China and Russia, are intensifying their engagement with the Taliban regime. But Pakistan remains frustrated with the Taliban’s meager actions against the terrorist group Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has bases in eastern Afghanistan. Despite the Taliban’s grave violations of human rights and women’s rights, U.S. interests in Afghanistan—including counterterrorism—are for now best served by maintaining a low-level equilibrium in engagement with the regime.
The Taliban’s power and its structures
The Taliban leadership includes dogmatic ideologues such as Haibatullah, as well as relative pragmatists who are more restrained in their desire to implement extreme versions of Sharia and interested in engagement with the West. Yet the pragmatists have failed to moderate the amir’s policies and have pulled back from challenging him.
Haibatullah is supported by a praetorian guard of powerful military commanders from Helmand and Kandahar, such as Abdul Qayyum Zakir. To counter rival leaders, such as Sirajuddin Haqqani and Mohammad Yaqub, Haibatullah has appointed his loyalists as deputy bosses across the regime’s ministries and agencies.
The Taliban regime refuses to integrate into its structures Afghan warlords, politicians, and most other individuals associated with the defeated Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. It has removed from office or demoted several non-Pashtun Taliban commanders. To monitor local actors, placate demands for inclusivity in policy decisions, and preserve its adroitness in resolving local disputes, the regime has established local religious ulama councils.
Human rights, such as freedom of expression, have been drastically weakened, with opposition actors and protesters arrested. In its gender apartheid—from the ban on girls’ education beyond primary school to restrictions on women’s travel and work—Haibatullah’s dogma stands out, even among various authoritarian Central Asian and Middle Eastern countries. But Haibatullah is impervious to criticism from Afghan and other Islamic religious scholars, other Taliban leaders, and other countries.
Yet underneath, the implementation of his edicts, such as restrictions on women in public spaces, girls’ education, and public executions, has been slow-walked, as local communities and Taliban officials dislike many of Haibatullah’s policies.
The regime’s economic viability
The shocks of Western sanctions, a profound liquidity crisis, and the collapse of Afghanistan’s economic system linked to the Western war machine produced a staggering contraction of Afghan GDP between 2021 and 2023 by 20%-30%. The economy has stabilized but is stagnating. At least 23 million Afghans, over half of the population, need humanitarian support, even as international aid has declined precipitously because of competing global needs, Western distaste for the Taliban’s repression, and Russia’s and China’s lack of interest in providing humanitarian assistance.
The Taliban’s effectiveness in reducing the immense corruption that characterized the republic boosted tax and revenue income. In 2023, Afghanistan benefited from brisk regional trade, including coal exports to Pakistan and exports of minerals across the region, amounting to $1.9 billion in Afghan exports. But in 2024, exports shrank substantially.
Implemented with stunning determination, Haibatullah’s ban on opium poppy brought cultivation down by over 95%. But it further immiserated Afghans. Wiping out 450,000 jobs at the farm level alone, the ban cost the Afghan economy at least $1.3 billion.
Haibatullah’s praetorian guard powerbrokers have benefited from the ban as the value of their heroin stockpiles skyrocketed. But if they cannot sell these stockpiles or eventually deplete them without the ban being revoked, cleavages between Haibatullah and his southern clique may arise. Such rifts could provide opportunities for policy changes.
Regional acceptance
Afghanistan’s neighbors are accommodating the Taliban regime in various ways. Regional talks to resurrect the Turkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan–India Gas Pipeline (TAPI) are underway. Afghanistan’s neighbors are also exploring ways to resume the Central Asia-South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project (CASA-1000) in Afghanistan, with its components in Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan nearly complete. Even Tajikistan is not ready to blow up a CASA-1000 deal. Tajikistan exhibits more hostility toward the Taliban than other regional actors and hosts Afghan Tajik opponents of the regime, such as the feeble anti-Taliban National Resistance Front, but it limits their activities. To maintain visibility on potential terrorist activity in Afghanistan, India has a low-level, but steady relationship with the Taliban, so far not seeking to undermine the regime. Seeking diversified international arrangements, the Taliban likes to divide economic deals across countries, even rivals such as the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.
Low-key trade between China and Afghanistan is picking up, with Afghanistan potentially included in China’s future Belt and Road Initiative projects. But just like the Afghan republic, the Taliban remains disappointed by the lack of Chinese investment. In July 2024, the ribbon was cut—for about the 10th time—at the Aynak Mas copper mine, where China has held a mining license for 15 years. But no actual extraction is around the corner.
Although no country has formally recognized the Taliban regime, regional diplomatic engagement has intensified. Most dramatically, China accepted the accreditation of the Taliban ambassador in Beijing in December 2023. Various countries have opened embassies in Kabul.
The region has stopped pushing the Taliban to include in its government ethnic powerbrokers from the Afghan republic. Uzbekistan is not even letting one such warlord and former Afghan vice president, Abdul Rashid Dostum, stay in Uzbekistan.
Surprisingly, it is Shiite Iran that has developed the deepest access to the Sunni Haibatullah. But this access hasn’t translated into Iran being able to satisfy its water interests, with the Taliban building dams over Iranian objections.
The Taliban’s oppression of the Hazara Shiite minority is less than during the 1990s.
In general, mass killings have been rare, and land theft is no greater than that perpetrated by powerbrokers associated with the Afghan republic.
Terrorism
Suppressing terrorism remains the region’s—and the United States’—primary interest. The Taliban has persisted in its years-old definition of what that means: preventing attacks out of the country, but not the presence of foreign fighters and terrorist groups in Afghanistan.
Foreign fighters are heading to Afghanistan, and madrassas are producing radicalized students. Iran is recruiting fighters for its “axis of resistance” operations from Afghan refugees in Iran. Sirajuddin Haqqani hosted al Qaeda’s leader, Ayman al-Zawahri, for a while, until the U.S. intelligence agencies killed him.
In the summer of 2023, a U.N. expert panel on Afghanistan produced an alarming report, predicting the reconstitution of al-Qaida’s capability in Afghanistan and a heightened possibility of global terrorist attacks. The U.S. intelligence assessment vehemently disagreed.
The Taliban has been going after the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP), an international terrorist group and a rival, with determination and effectiveness. Russia has not blamed the Taliban for failing to prevent the ISKP attack on Moscow’s Crocus City Hall in March 2024, finding the ISKP planned it in Central Asia.
The Taliban has also placated China regarding Uyghur militants, moving them away from the border with China. It maintains regular counterterrorism exchanges with Western intelligence agencies.
But the Taliban has bucked its former masters and supporters in Pakistan’s intelligence agencies by refusing to counter the TTP’s safe havens. The TTP is connected by familial ties to the Haqqanis, and the Taliban fears that any crackdowns would drive TTP fighters to ISKP. TTP attacks in Pakistan have racked up casualties and threatened Chinese economic assets in Pakistan. Islamabad has promised Beijing that it can pick and choose among the militants, suppressing the ones that threaten its and Chinese interests (like TTP), while nurturing the anti-India ones and previously the Taliban.
The Taliban’s negotiations with the TTP brought temporary lulls in TTP violence, but nothing more. Frustrated, Pakistan expelled Afghan refugees from Pakistan, but to no avail.
The best the United States can get
For now, the United States should reconcile itself to building a low-level equilibrium with the Taliban. Such an equilibrium best advances the United States’ primary counterterrorism interests. If international terrorist attacks are linked to the Taliban, the United States should strike with drones and missiles.
The United States should foster channels to the more pragmatic Taliban leaders and look for quid-pro-quo positive transactions. Such a foundation may provide opportunities to shape, a little bit at least, the Taliban’s behavior, should the balance of power within the Taliban change. That doesn’t preclude engaging with the Afghan diaspora, particularly those untarnished by corruption, predatory rule, and human rights abuses.
Washington should continue highlighting women’s rights and human rights. But absent a power change within the Taliban, it is unlikely that the United States can effectuate dramatic policy changes. That should not stop the United States from supporting female entrepreneurs in Afghanistan, internet schooling and health care for Afghan girls, and humanitarian aid.
A collapse of the regime and the outbreak of civil war in Afghanistan, exacerbated by beefed-up international support for anti-Taliban resistance groups, would worsen counterterrorism objectives and augment refugee flows. A Taliban faction would likely win anyway. No international actor is ready to move in this direction.
Nor will Western isolation of the Taliban improve the regime’s governance and human rights. It will only deprive Washington of any shaping opportunities, while Russia, China, and Iran continue to foster their relations with the Taliban."
94,Stablecoins and national security: Learning the lessons of Eurodollars,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/stablecoins-and-national-security-learning-the-lessons-of-eurodollars/,Timothy G. Massad,"April 17, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",RESEARCH,"As Congress struggles to resolve big issues like funding for Ukraine and Israel, the debate over legislation to regulate stablecoins seems like small potatoes. But there is a connection, which is that stablecoins could have national security implications: Unless we strengthen their regulation, they could undermine our ability to use sanctions to advance our national interests. This was illustrated recently by news that Russian smugglers have used Tether, the largest stablecoin, to avoid Western sanctions and purchase billions of dollars worth of weapons.
Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that is far more useful as a means of payment than Bitcoin.1 That is because stablecoins are designed to maintain a constant price in terms of another asset.2 Stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar are more “money-like” than other cryptocurrencies. They can be used to move value across borders without going through banks, and it is the banking system—and in particular the role of U.S. banks—that is key to the implementation and efficacy of sanctions.
Stablecoins are in some respects similar to Eurodollars, a financial innovation that helped to create the financial plumbing used to implement sanctions. Both stablecoins and Eurodollars are U.S. dollar-based liabilities that had their origins outside the regulated banking system. U.S. policymakers initially paid little attention to Eurodollars because the market was small. But it quickly grew, and—luckily for policymakers—Eurodollars ultimately helped cement the international role of the dollar. It is the global dominance of the dollar, coupled with the role of U.S. banks in facilitating dollar payments, that gives the U.S. its tremendous financial leverage.
Could stablecoins undermine that leverage? As with the early days of the Eurodollar market, stablecoin use is minimal today, and so their national security risk may also be minimal. But just as Eurodollar use grew quickly and unexpectedly, stablecoins could also grow. While they are used principally to trade other crypto assets today, they could become a more widespread means of payment. They have also become popular as a means for people in countries with weak currencies to acquire a dollar substitute. Moreover, that growth could come even if the U.S. does not take action. That is because many other jurisdictions are creating frameworks to license stablecoins, including Europe, the U.K., Japan, Singapore and the U.A.E. While those frameworks may lead to stablecoins in native currencies, they could also give rise to new dollar-based stablecoins.
This paper discusses how stablecoins could destabilize what Eurodollars helped to create—the global financial system plumbing that has been a means to implement sanctions3—and what to do about it. First, I provide a brief summary of the history of Eurodollars and their rapid growth. I discuss how Eurodollars strengthened the role of the U.S. dollar and U.S. banks. I then discuss the risks that stablecoins pose, in particular how they could be used to circumvent the existing financial system plumbing and sanctions. Finally, I suggest a path forward to promote responsible financial innovation while protecting our national security interests."

The SECURE 2.0 legislation, passed in December 2022, is the most extensive set of changes to retirement law in the last 15 years. In this paper, we place SECURE 2.0 in the context of the ongoing evolution of the retirement system, summarize its key provisions, and discuss the need for additional reforms. Because 2024 marks the 50th anniversary of the passage of ERISA, assessing the broad arc of retirement policy and behavior is particularly timely. Previous reform efforts, including automatic 401(k)s, Automatic IRAs, and the saver’s credit, aimed to make retirement saving easier and more rewarding for rank-and-file workers. More recently, SECURE and SECURE 2.0 improved and expanded the saver’s credit (renamed the saver’s match), expanded automatic enrollment, and extended plan participation to more part-time employees. They also facilitated multiple-employer plans and took steps to improve account portability and disclosure, reduce pre-retirement leakage, facilitate emergency saving, and promote better options to convert savings into retirement income. However, there are still important avenues for policy to make the retirement system more equitable and effective. Particularly important are eliminating the coverage gap and closing the racial, ethnic, and gender gaps in retirement wealth. Other key goals include helping workers convert savings into reliable lifetime income; encouraging people to work longer; reducing pre-retirement leakage, including by ensuring that retirement savings can follow workers from job to job; and exempting smaller savers from the required minimum distribution rules.

97,Switzerland: Europe’s critical vulnerability,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/switzerland-europes-critical-vulnerability/,Constanze Stelzenmüller,"March 12, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"It is not difficult to list the contributions that Switzerland could make to Europe’s security; what is more interesting is the question of why it should do so. But one thing at a time.
Recently, Swiss journalist Roger de Weck told the Neue Zürcher Zeitung that his country is “the niche […] where things happen that are forbidden elsewhere.” The Swiss criminal law professor and corruption hunter Mark Pieth describes this somewhat whimsically as the “pirates’ harbor.” The aspects of Swiss politics they are referring to are well-known and regularly scrutinized in the established Swiss media. Their critique goes well beyond an understanding of neutrality that is increasingly alienating Switzerland’s neighbors and which—by way of example—prohibits even democratic neighbors from passing on armaments produced by former Swiss companies to a Ukraine fighting against a brutal aggressor.
Switzerland, which likes to see itself as a storm-tossed island of the blessed, is in reality the world’s largest (and very tolerant) offshore financial center. It has long been a hub for the global commodities trade and a huge magnet for seemingly endless flows of less-than-licit data, money, goods, and people that make up the dark underbelly of globalization. All of this is served by a dense and anything-but-transparent network of lawyers, consultants, and brokers.
Even before the Russian attack on Ukraine on February 24, 2022, this state of affairs was a nuisance to many other states. But in the context of Europe’s greatest security crisis since 1945, it allows the Kremlin to undermine Western sanctions (which Switzerland is at least participating in), thereby potentially prolonging the war. In geo-economic terms, this makes Switzerland a critical vulnerability in Europe’s security policy.
There are plenty of concrete proposals to close this security gap. Switzerland could create a supervisory authority for commodities trading; or even better, become part of international monitoring efforts. The G7 countries and the European Union would like to see Switzerland make more of an effort to close loopholes in the prosecution of sanctions-breakers; they are also calling for Bern to join the international REPO (Russian Elites, Proxies and Oligarchs) task force, which tracks down Russian kleptocrats’ hidden assets. After all, the Swiss Bankers Association itself estimates that at least 150 billion Swiss francs (approximately $171 billion) of Russian assets are held in Swiss accounts.
That leaves the question of why. Swiss media have a rather conspicuous habit of theorizing about “enormous pressure” from abroad. It is a bit reminiscent of Berlin, where policymakers or politicians often invoke “constraints” (circumstances, allies, norms) compelling them to act. And the Swiss banking secret was indeed brought down by the U.S. Treasury a decade ago.
And yet why would such a rich and powerful country, one of the 20 largest economies in the world and currently a non-permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, pretend that it is so much smaller and weaker than it is? Especially since Switzerland, unlike Germany, has elevated the principle of neutrality—the freedom not to take sides—to a raison d’etre. The contradiction is obvious.
Perhaps it is time for Bern to rethink the prerequisites for freedom of action in an age of strategic competition, a disintegrating world order, and the formation of blocs between democratic and autocratic powers. Switzerland is, of course, not an island, but rather a global player in a world economy that is becoming increasingly interdependent. It is also exposed to the weaponization of interdependence. Some might now point out that Switzerland is a passive beneficiary of the order of peace, law, and prosperity protected by NATO and the EU in Europe. But as a non-member, it has no voice or veto in the circle of these friends; it is a rule taker, not a rule maker.
NATO and the EU initially closed ranks against the impact of Russia’s aggression—which is directed not just at Ukraine but at the entire European order. Yet in light of the fact that Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea are increasingly finding common ground and that the so-called Global South is by no means taking the side of the victim and its allies, the West is currently on the defensive. And should Donald Trump or a Trumpist win the U.S. elections in November 2024, Europe would be quite lonely in the world—and Switzerland with it.
Will that propel Switzerland to suddenly seek protection in alliances or the EU? Or to eliminate its geo-economic vulnerabilities in order to offer Europe’s opponents one fewer entry point? Hardly. But the notion that its exposure is a national security gap and should be closed in the interests of its own freedom of action has just become rather more plausible."

99,Learning from the United States’ failure to prevent the Yemen war,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/learning-from-the-united-states-failure-to-prevent-the-yemen-war/,Allison Minor,"September 18, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"The Houthis—a minor armed group from Yemen—have succeeded in upending global maritime commerce through the Red Sea, driving up the cost of goods globally and dampening global GDP, including in the United States. And there is little the United States can do about it. The United States is battling the Houthis in what officials have called the largest naval battle since World War II, but the Houthi threat is only increasing.
It is an important time to ask how we got here.
While the United States has few good options now, it could have helped prevent the war that propelled the Houthis to power and devastated Yemen. And doing so would have been far easier and less costly than battling the current Houthi threat. So why did the United States fail to do so?
In a new research paper, “How the United States could have prevented the Yemen War,” I identify three windows of opportunity between 2011 and 2015 when the United States could have prevented or mitigated the Yemen war. I describe the specific policy actions the United States could have taken during this period, while being clear-eyed about the limitations both of U.S. influence inside of Yemen and within the U.S. policy space.1 More importantly, I explore what U.S. failures in Yemen tell us about how the United States could improve its ability to prevent similar conflicts going forward and whether current reform efforts are sufficient.
Yemen is a compelling case study for two reasons: 1) the United States had a strong interest in and the ability to prevent the war; in fact, dozens of the policymakers in place in 2015 when the war broke out published a public letter acknowledging the U.S. policy failures, including President Barack Obama’s national security advisor; 2) Yemen is one of a growing number of “internationalized” wars—internal wars with significant international involvement—that have proven particularly destabilizing and difficult to resolve.
Missed opportunities
I find that the United States had three windows of opportunity to prevent or mitigate the Yemen war between 2011-2015:
2011
The United States could have used sanctions and a travel ban to secure stronger conditions on former Yemeni president/dictator Ali Abdullah Saleh after a popular, military-backed protest movement pushed him out of power in 2011. This would have prevented him from backing the Houthis to overthrow Yemen’s political transition process.
Observed events: The United States, led by senior White House officials, supported a transition agreement under which Saleh was allowed to stay in Yemen, remain the head of the country’s dominant political party, and retain the billions he amassed while in power.
Counterfactual causal chains and assumptions: Absent Saleh’s support, it is highly unlikely the Houthis could have seized the capital or other significant territory. Saleh was highly vulnerable to both sanctions and a travel ban in summer 2011, and the United States, in coordination with Saudi Arabia, could have credibly threatened these actions to secure Saleh’s cooperation with stricter terms (e.g., exile) that would have significantly restrained his ability to support the Houthis.
Why the United States failed to seize the opportunity: Senior White House officials were aware Saleh posed a serious threat to the transition process but were hesitant to take actions that could disrupt high-priority U.S. counterterrorism activities (Saleh’s family members continued to oversee Yemen’s counterterrorism forces). Further, securing regional and international support for tougher conditions on Saleh would have required strong U.S. diplomatic leadership at a time when senior U.S. policymakers were overwhelmed dealing with instability across the Middle East.
2014
The United States could have used its considerable leverage with former Yemeni President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi to dissuade him from pursuing a plan for a future federal Yemen state that was unrealistic and put him in direct conflict with the Houthis following their takeover of the capital, a conflict which ultimately triggered the outbreak of the war.
Observed events: Hadi pushed through a federal plan that intentionally sought to erode Houthi political and economic power, despite the fact that Hadi lacked the strength to enforce such a plan. The Houthis responded by placing Hadi and his cabinet under house arrest in January 2015. After Hadi escaped, the Saudi-led coalition launched a major military campaign against the Houthis.
Counterfactual causal chains and assumptions: After taking control of the capital in September, the Houthis gradually asserted control of government institutions but were hesitant to topple the government, as doing so would jeopardize the legitimacy of a government they were effectively controlling. If the United States had pushed Hadi to pursue a more viable plan, Yemen could have avoided a major escalation, preserving space for U.N.-led negotiations to reach a new political equilibrium. While this scenario would have formalized Houthi power within the government, the political space prior to the war would have permitted significant constraints on Houthi power and behavior.
Why the United States failed to seize the opportunity: It should have been clear to the United States that Hadi would lose in a confrontation with the Houthis, especially by September 2014, when the Houthis seized control of the capital with almost no resistance. However, the United States failed to update its assumptions about the Houthis and the status of the transition process, even in the face of overwhelming evidence.
2015
The White House could have made its support for the Saudi-led military campaign contingent on the Saudis identifying a credible end goal and path to negotiations. While the United States was unable to prevent the war at this stage, this approach could have facilitated an early transition to negotiations, significantly limiting the scope and duration of the conflict.  
Observed events: The United States provided unqualified support to the Saudi campaign and backed a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for a full Houthi surrender, which complicated U.N.-led negotiation efforts for years.
Counterfactual causal chains and assumptions: Saudi dependence on U.S. diplomatic and military support provided the United States with leverage to shape the Saudi approach and objectives, particularly before they publicly announced the campaign. The United States was likely unable to dissuade the Saudis from launching the campaign, and concerns over the Saudi-U.S. bilateral relationship and priorities like the Iran nuclear deal prevented the United States from outright refusing to support the campaign. However, the United States could have used its leverage to convince Saudi Arabia to moderate its maximalist objectives and identify a pathway to negotiations without jeopardizing these other priorities. This could have facilitated an earlier transition to negotiations, especially after the Saudi-led coalition made significant military gains in mid-2015.
Why the United States failed to seize the opportunity: U.S. policymakers, including Obama’s CIA director, knew at the time that the Saudi campaign plan was not viable, but officials failed to weigh the consequences for Yemeni stability alongside immediate U.S. policy imperatives like the Iran nuclear deal and U.S.-Saudi bilateral relationship. A persistent wishful thinking bias and the lack of strategic planning in the lead-up to the Saudi request exacerbated this failure.
Learning from U.S. failures in Yemen
The U.S. failure to seize these windows of opportunity was the result of systemic impediments to effective preventative action, including:
The challenge of weighing the medium-term consequences of a policy decision alongside short-term costs.
An adaptability challenge, namely the difficulty of updating U.S. assumptions in a sufficiently timely manner during dynamic periods, even in the face of overwhelming evidence, in part due to a “wishful thinking” bias.
Insufficient high-level attention and bandwidth dedicated to Yemen even during periods of crisis, which compounded the adaptability challenge by undermining decisive U.S. policy action.
At no point were U.S. policymakers faced with an easy opportunity to prevent the Yemen war. To seize these fleeting windows of opportunity, officials would have had to accept tough truths and trade-offs and quickly mobilize resources. The U.S. ability to prevent conflict has always hinged on U.S. policy decisions, not how Washington wielded individual foreign policy tools like foreign assistance. Overcoming these systemic impediments to taking preventative action and seizing windows of opportunity would require significant reforms to elevate conflict prevention and make policymaking processes in countries at risk of conflict more adaptive and responsive.
The United States has reasserted its commitment to conflict prevention during the past 10 years, but it has failed to effectively address these policymaking challenges. The 2019 Global Fragility Act (GFA), the most significant and recent U.S. conflict prevention initiative, represents the culmination of years of efforts to learn from U.S. policy failures in fragile and conflict-affected countries and seeks to support long-term, whole-of-government investments in select countries. But the GFA has operated largely as a foreign assistance initiative and lacks the tools and authorities to influence the policymaking processes and decisions that are at the core of the U.S. ability to prevent conflict. While the GFA’s focus on learning could theoretically help address the adaptability challenge noted above, the initiative is primarily focused on long-term lessons for improving foreign assistance and the tools it has developed are not appropriate for informing real-time decisions of policymakers in rapidly changing environments.
In another new paper, “Implementing prevention: A practical guide for improving the U.S. approach to violent conflict in a changing world,” I provide a model for crafting a more effective approach that focuses on establishing more adaptive, responsive policymaking processes in strategically relevant countries with a near- to medium-term risk of conflict, building policymaker buy-in, and arming officials with the appropriate resources and incentives to prioritize prevention."

Kim, Kevin Dong, Mallie Prytherch","January 22, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"How is China responding to the Israel-Hamas war?1 Since Hamas’ October 7 terrorist attack on Israel and the subsequent Israeli strikes on Gaza, Beijing has positioned itself as an advocate for peace, calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state while criticizing the United States’ support for Israel. In the weeks following the attacks, China hosted the foreign ministers of four Arab states and Indonesia. The fact that the delegation chose Beijing as its first stop was heralded by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi as a sign that “China is a good friend and brother of Arab and Islamic countries.”
While more than 10 Chinese nationals have been killed, injured, or reported missing as a result of the crisis, the Israel-Hamas war has not, however, generated much of a public reaction in China. In fact, a close examination of Beijing’s official statements and activities, commentaries in state media, and social media narratives around the Israel-Hamas war reveals that while China seeks to portray itself as a proponent for peace and to signal its alignment with many non-Western states in advocating for the Palestinian cause, it remains reluctant to assume a substantive role in the ongoing conflict.
Parsing official Chinese statements and diplomatic activities
Official Chinese statements on the Israel-Hamas war have centered on expressing broad concern around the conflict’s escalation and its humanitarian consequences. Beijing has not explicitly condemned Hamas’ terrorist attacks while stressing that only a political settlement and a two-state solution can ultimately solve the conflict between Israel and Palestine.
Chinese President Xi Jinping commented publicly for the first time on the crisis nearly two weeks after the October 7 attacks on the sidelines of the Belt and Road Forum. In a meeting with Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, Xi called for a permanent cease-fire and the need to prevent the conflict from spiraling out of control. His remarks that a two-state solution and establishing an independent State of Palestine are the “only viable way” to resolve the longstanding conflict between Israel and Palestine were again reiterated in his speech at an extraordinary BRICS summit on the crisis the following month.
In the early weeks of the crisis, Wang spoke with his counterparts in the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority (PA), in addition to Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Russia, and the United States. A comparison of the official Chinese readouts of these meetings provides a window into how Beijing seeks to position itself publicly amid the crisis. For instance, the summary of Wang’s call with PA Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki adopts a considerably warmer tone, starting with Al-Maliki’s “heartfelt thanks to China” for “standing firmly with the Palestinian people” and a summary of the PA’s position.
In contrast, the readout of Wang’s call with Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen simply notes that Cohen gave “an update on Israel’s position” to China. Wang is then quoted lecturing his Israeli counterpart that “All countries have a right to self-defense, but it is important to observe humanitarian law and protect civilians.” Wang notes that “only by adhering to common security can sustainable security be achieved” — a core theme of Beijing’s “Global Security Initiative.” Beijing has employed this argument with greater frequency in recent years to criticize the United States and its allies for pursuing “individual security” at the expense of “common security,” and to lend diplomatic support to Moscow, Pyongyang, and other “victims” of Western containment.
Although Beijing and Washington theoretically share a mutual interest in preventing the spread of conflict in the Middle East, there seems to be little, if any, coordination between the two sides on the crisis. At the United Nations, the United States and China have stood at a crossroads. The U.N. Security Council has failed on four separate occasions to pass a resolution related to the Israel-Hamas war due to vetoes by the United States, China, and/or Russia. China has vetoed a U.S.-sponsored draft resolution for failing to call for an immediate, permanent cease-fire, while the United States has vetoed resolutions for failing to condemn the attacks of October 7 and not mentioning Israel’s right to self-defense.
China has taken steps to bring attention to this division — for instance, Chinese Ambassador to the EU Fu Cong stated that “there are many countries who obviously do not see eye to eye with Europe in terms of values … We can clearly tell from the divergence of responses to the ongoing Gaza crisis.”
Eschewing a leading role in the conflict
Even as China has expanded its diplomatic footprint in the Middle East — most notably helping broker a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran to restore relations last March — it has not sought to assume a leading role in the ongoing conflict in Gaza. In late November, Beijing released a five-point position paper in which it calls for an immediate cease-fire, the protection of civilians, and the ramping up of humanitarian assistance.
The paper also calls for “countries with influence on parties” to help deescalate the crisis and for an international peace conference to draft a “concrete timetable and roadmap” to implement a two-state solution and a “just and lasting solution to the question of Palestine.” Quite notably, the paper explicitly calls for the U.N. Security Council or the U.N. to take the lead on advancing each of the five points. Nowhere is there a reference to Beijing’s offer from last spring to mediate between Israel and Palestine.
Last week, Wang began his first foreign trip of the year in Egypt, where he expressed China’s support for a “larger-scale” international peace conference, stating the details of the conference would be “determined by all parties,” and for the United Nations to play an “active role” in the process. Despite growing global concerns about the Houthis’ attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea and China’s economic stakes in the region, Beijing has shown no interest in directly addressing the mounting crisis other than declaring its opposition to the harassment of civilian ships and obliquely criticizing U.S. and British airstrikes against Houthi-controlled sites in Yemen.
Narratives in state-owned media
Chinese state-owned media has leaned into using the crisis to cast Washington as the driver of instability in the Middle East. Many of these articles point to the United States’ “hegemonic behavior,” its history of military interventions in the Middle East, and its “biased” support for Israel as key drivers of the current conflict. For example, one editorial in the Global Times states that the United States and Europe’s inability to “uphold the existing world order” and their “marginalization of the Palestinian issue” are the driving factors in the current conflict. Another blames the United States and some of its Western partners for “add[ing] fuel to the fire” and for “seeking absolute security” for themselves “under the guise of peace.” These critiques parallel Chinese accusations that the United States is “fanning the flames” in the Russia-Ukraine war by providing Ukraine with lethal assistance.
Domestically, state-owned media has gone further. In one instance in early October, a China Central Television social media account reposted a clip from coverage of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. It included several antisemitic conspiracy theories, including that “Jews influence the U.S. government through money and votes.” The social media clip went on to utilize the hashtag “占美人口3%犹太人操纵七成美国财富,” or “Jews represent 3% of the U.S. population but control 70% of the U.S. wealth.”
Narratives in Chinese social media
Weibo, often described as a Chinese version of X (formerly known as Twitter), is one of the few remaining gauges of Chinese public opinion despite substantial censorship of its content and the heavy presence of government-sanctioned posts. A few weeks after the outbreak of the conflict, there were 12 trending topics/hashtags related to the Israel-Hamas war that were read by at least 250 million people (see Table 1). Interestingly, most of the trending topics focused on Israel rather than Gaza, Hamas, or Palestine, although whether this reflected genuine user interest or curation efforts by censors is difficult to determine. Videos and photos of attacks committed by both Israel and Hamas were rampant, although more posts highlighted atrocities committed by Israel. Posts that discussed terrorism by Hamas were not censored, however, and received both sympathy and condemnation from netizens."
103,Health care costs are a top concern for voters in the 2024 election,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/health-care-costs-are-a-top-concern-for-voters-in-the-2024-election/,Gabriel R. Sanchez,"July 3, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Although overshadowed in the national political discourse by discussions about the importance of the economy, immigration, or abortion, voters have expressed that health care continues to be one of their highest priorities. In fact, a May 2024 poll by Pew found that health care was the third-highest issue priority for voters, garnering a robust 57% from respondents.
The salience of health care bodes well for Biden since he outperforms Trump on health care (39% trust Biden on health care, compared to 34% who prefer Trump), as seen from an ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted last month, consistent with most polls that show a similar modest advantage for Biden on the matter.
The importance of health care to voters is magnified when we consider that it is one of the factors compounding the economic stress Americans are facing, resulting in inflation and the rising cost of living outpacing all other issues in poll
Most voters include the rising health care costs they are experiencing among other critical purchases they have to make. For example, a recent KFF tracking poll shows that health care tops the list of basic expenses Americans worry about—even more than gas, food, and rent. In fact, nearly three in four adults in that KFF poll underscore that they’re concerned about paying for unexpected medical bills and other health costs.
Health care and Latino voters
Health care resonates as a policy issue to many sub-groups of the larger electorate, including Latino voters who continue to trail other racial and ethnic groups in access to health insurance and medical care. A recent UnidosUS poll found health care to be third among policy priorities for registered Latino voters, behind only the rising cost of living and jobs/the economy.
When Latino voters are asked to provide clarity on what they mean when they identify health care as a top priority, the cost of health care (premiums, deductibles, etc.) is the most commonly cited definition, followed by prescription costs, and then quality of care.
Although discussions regarding Latino voting behavior focus largely on the potential shift of Latinos toward Trump and the Republican Party, interestingly, health care tends to be a particularly relevant policy issue among Latinos who are moving to the left in their partisan preferences. UnidosUS finds that a sizable 38% of Latino self-identified Republicans reporting greater openness to Democrats in 2024 identify health care as a top issue of concern, with premiums and prescription drug costs most often identified as the root of these Republicans’ concerns.
Sharp differences in policy priorities for voters to consider
While its name doesn’t suggest landmark health policy, the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, included a provision allowing Medicare to negotiate prices for some of the most expensive drugs. The IRA also capped the total out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs for all Medicare patients, dropping from roughly $3,500 to $2,000, while capping the price of insulin for those with diabetes at $35 a month. These are policy actions that can directly address the concerns of voters. The challenge for Biden continues to be connecting his policy advancements with voters and more effectively communicating these important reductions to health care costs.
The Affordable Care Act will continue to be a factor for voters some 14 years after it was passed by former President Obama. The popularity of the ACA makes this a dangerous environment for Republicans, as former President Trump has suggested he would repeal the law if elected. The KFF poll found that more adults want to see the program expanded rather than scaled back, and there has been a recent surge in insurance enrollments, with a record 21.3 million people signed up for coverage already in 2024—a quarter of those being new consumers of health insurance. Compounding the political pressure for Republicans in 2024, this increase in enrollments has been higher in red states, with annual increases of 80% in West Virginia, 75% in Louisiana, and 62% in Ohio, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
Although former President Trump has said he wouldn’t cut Medicare spending, Democrats will likely seek to associate him with other Republicans who support constraining the program’s costs. However, raising taxes on people making more than $400,000 a year to shore up Medicare’s finances is one idea that received strong backing in a recent poll by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
As November 2024 approaches, other issues will likely continue to capture national headlines. Health care, however, just might be the issue that ultimately decides the election outcome. The candidate who can persuade the American public that they have the best plan to reduce the costs of health care expenditures will emerge victorious and has the opportunity to tackle the rising costs of health insurance, prescription drugs, and other medical costs."
104,Exploring and improving how state water funding flows amid a surge in federal infrastructure investment,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/exploring-and-improving-how-state-water-funding-flows-amid-a-surge-in-federal-infrastructure-investment/,"Joseph W. Kane, Anna Singer","December 5, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",RESEARCH,"The United States’ water infrastructure—including its drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater systems—faces enormous investment gaps. Leaking pipes, inefficient treatment plants, and other aging, vulnerable facilities not only require extensive upgrades, but are also contending with a variety of operational pressures due to a changing climate, an evolving economy, and more. As the primary owners and operators of this infrastructure, local water utilities bear most of these pressures, especially when it comes to planning and paying for improvements. But federal and state leaders also play a key role in regulatory oversight, programmatic coordination, and ongoing investment—heightened by the historic funding unlocked by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). 
State leaders in particular oversee a key conduit for water funding: State Revolving Funds (SRFs). These federally capitalized, state-led loan programs provide essential support for a range of clean water and drinking water projects across the country, including $43 billion appropriated via current federal infrastructure legislation. State agencies coordinate with local water utilities (and other eligible borrowers for SRF loans) to develop and implement plans—known as Intended Use Plans (IUPs)—and ultimately prioritize and assess how this funding is used across Clean Water SRFs (CWSRFs) and Drinking Water SRFs (DWSRFs). SRFs generally offer a low-cost and flexible option for local leaders to accelerate needed improvements. 
However, despite the reach and impact of SRF funding, economic development officials, policymakers, and other stakeholders often do not understand how utilities access these funds and coordinate with states to prioritize projects. This confusion and uncertainty not only reduce the visibility of current water investments, but also potentially limit broader collaborations and community buy-in around future investments. That’s especially true when considering different climate- and equity-focused projects, including those that reduce flooding, promote water quality, and support affordability and access. Local utilities often have limited technical, financial, and staffing capacity to pursue such projects, making these broader collaborations all the more important and timely.  
This report explores the nexus between state and local water funding to better understand various challenges around planning, project selection, and capacity in the current federal investment moment. It specifically examines the role of SRFs—particularly through IUPs and other materials—to illuminate whether and how state leaders are accelerating investments, often with notable gaps around climate and equity needs. It finds that: 
While many states spell out clear goals and identify a range of specific, needed projects as part of their annual water infrastructure planning efforts, they do not always prioritize climate or equity needs. For example, more than three-quarters of all states include some type of measurement and accountability around their IUP goals, but only about half explicitly include “green projects” in their goals, and only about a quarter describe environmental justice (EJ) concerns. Colorado and Washington are among the states that provide more extensive details on project timelines and other issues, including affordability and climate resilience. 
Many states do not cover the finer details when prioritizing and evaluating different water projects. Part of the challenge is that not all states—only about 47% of CWSRF and 61% of DWSRF programs—include project priority lists separately and publicly transparently from their IUPs. Exceptions include Kentucky and Indiana, which go into extensive detail on criteria to prioritize different green projects. In addition, despite notable gaps around equity projects, some states, including Pennsylvania and New Jersey, describe how they award points around related criteria in their project priority lists. 
A potential culprit: Constraints around fiscal, technical, and programmatic capacity are widespread and limit the ability of states and local utilities to proactively address needed water investments. For example, most states do not address local staffing needs to access and implement SRF funding. Less than 29% of states describe staffing needs in the short- and long-term goals within their IUPs, and less than 40% assess outstanding staffing needs in their annual reports. Alaska is among the states focusing on hiring additional program support and engineering staff to effectively implement SRF funding during the current federal moment. 
Struggles to address such gaps hold back coordinated state and local action. As SRF program managers try to identify quality projects and creditworthy applicants, there may be structural barriers for many communities, including local utilities, to access funding where it is needed most. SRFs are not the only (or primary) vehicle to invest in the country’s water infrastructure needs, but they are a major piece of the funding puzzle. And the lack of equitable access to address pressing concerns—around climate challenges, for instance—is limiting investment across the country. However, this report reveals opportunities for federal, state, and local leaders to support greater capacity among utilities—particularly around staffing and technical assistance—to address such gaps.

Pipa,"October 28, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"With the major-party nominations for vice president featuring two candidates with authentic rural roots, prospects seemed promising for a policy debate during the campaign about the role that the federal government can play in helping rural America prosper. Yet neither of the moderators during the vice-presidential debate on October 1 even uttered the word “rural,” and despite the forum’s much-praised focus on substance, none of it touched specifically on rural policy.
That was a missed opportunity, as there seem to be real differences between how the two possible presidential administrations would approach ensuring investment, opportunity, and economic security reach rural America. A large majority of rural residents believe their communities receive less than their fair share of federal resources (a perception with which their urban and suburban counterparts largely agree). While the media mostly fixates on the tactics of winning over rural voters—messaging, outreach, and getting out the vote—they deserve a better sense of how the candidates view the options for a federal role in generating and supporting rural prosperity.
Harris-Walz campaign
For their part, the Harris-Walz ticket recently put forward a Plan for Rural Communities. The plan reiterates some general policy priorities already put forward by the campaign, such as its goal of building 3 million new homes, with the presumption that the effects will ripple into rural areas. But it does include several rural-specific policy proposals.
First among them is a focus on improving access to rural health care. Priorities include protecting rural hospitals and pharmacies, cutting ambulance deserts in half, extending pandemic-era Medicare policies for telehealth, and recruiting 10,000 health care professionals to rural places through a mix of scholarships, loan forgiveness, and a new grant program to train and fund rural community health workers.
This proposal neatly fits into Harris’s focus on the care economy, a central pillar of her domestic policy agenda. But it also seeks to address issues in a key rural sector: The health care economy has become one of the largest segments of rural employment even as health care access in rural areas has declined significantly.
One-hundred ninety-four rural hospitals have closed since 2005, and workforce shortages are exacerbated by talent pipeline challenges: A recent study found a 28% drop in rural students attending medical school over a 15-year period, a cause for alarm since rural students are 10 times more likely to prefer working in rural areas.
In agriculture, there is a focus on supporting beginning farmers and ranchers with access to credit and technical assistance, as well as a pledge to help smaller-scale farmers and processors compete with larger interests through anti-trust enforcement and other means.
The Harris-Walz plan also spotlights the need to expand and support local capacity to access and deploy investment. It pledges to expand the Rural Partners Network, a pilot program launched by the Biden administration in 10 states that places federal staff in rural communities to help them identify opportunities for federal funding. The plan also throws its support behind bipartisan legislation sponsored by Senators Casey (D-PA) and Fischer (R-NE) to offer flexible funds to local rural governments and nonprofits for the staffing, expertise, coordination, and planning they need to secure public and private investment for new projects and economic development.
The implication is that these two programs could help more communities secure and manage the $464 billion worth of opportunities that have disproportionate relevance for rural community and economic development in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), the CHIPs and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed by the previous Congress.  
The extent to which rural stakeholders will be able to access and take full advantage of those opportunities remains uncertain. Since the planned distribution of those resources will extend well into the next decade, a new Harris-Walz administration will need to build out and sustain high-quality, robust measures—whether or not Congress follows through on the proposals under consideration—to ensure such investments reach and bear full fruit in rural places, recognizing their unique constraints.
Trump-Vance campaign
While the Trump-Vance campaign has not released a rural plan per se, the past couple of weeks also saw Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. publicly suggesting that the former president has pledged support for his Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) campaign and hinting at major changes in U.S. agriculture and health policy.
A key objective of the MAHA agenda focuses on reducing the prevalence of highly processed foods as well as obesity. To achieve this, RFK Jr. has suggested reforming agriculture subsidies to large-scale producers, which cheapen the crops often found in processed foods; that could mean cutting back on subsidies or shifting to different crops, such as fruits (or both). He has also been adamant about elevating support for regenerative agriculture and smaller-scale family farms.
The Obama and Biden administrations shared somewhat analogous aspirations in reorienting the food system, and RFK Jr.’s pledge to give “smaller operators a break” is not dissimilar from the Harris-Walz rhetoric, but it would constitute a reversal from the previous Trump administration, whose regulatory decisions were accused of favoring large agribusiness, reflecting what then-Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue held up as “the big get bigger and the small go out.”
Aid to farmers reached historic highs during that administration as it sought to mitigate the impact of its trade war with China. One analysis, by the Environmental Working Group, suggests that the largest 10% of producers received over half of that relief.
While there are questions about the strength of former president Trump’s commitment to the MAHA agenda, he appears, based on his media interviews and campaign speeches, very likely to continue the use of tariffs as a major policy tool. If he once again increases aid to farmers to compensate, the resilience of many local farming economies may depend upon the extent to which he targets and ensures that support reaches smaller-scale and family farms.
The previous Trump administration proposed a reorganization of the U.S. Department of Agriculture that included dissolving its Rural Development mission area (USDA-RD) and making significant cuts to the division’s programs that finance rural infrastructure, housing, and small businesses. Congress denied the bulk of those proposals and kept USDA-RD intact. Trump has now pledged to roll back unspent IRA funds, and some Congressional allies and the conservative Project 2025 suggest eliminating the Economic Development Administration (EDA), an office responsible for key new place-based programs.
The programs that intersect with rural interests in IIJA, CHIPs, and IRA have been over-subscribed—EDA’s new Recompete pilot program received 585 applications, the most ever for a national competition in the agency’s history—and there is evidence that rural places are disproportionately benefiting from both the public and private investment by the IRA. If as-yet-unallocated funds are rescinded, rural communities will be interested in other options a new Trump administration might offer to enable the investment they seem eager to attract.
Perhaps the biggest unknown is how a new Trump administration’s immigration policies would impact rural communities. Many of the most acute labor shortages in the country are occurring in rural-dominated states, and rural economies as diverse as agriculture, manufacturing, and health care are already relying upon significant proportions of foreign-born workers. Holding aside the complex logistical, legal, and ethical considerations, a new administration will need to consider how implementation avoids putting local rural economies at risk.
As important as federal policy has historically been for rural prosperity—the Rural Electrification Act is often heralded as one of our most successful national policies—rural residents have lost trust that policymakers have their best interests at heart. Proposals from the two presidential campaigns seek to respond to the challenges as well as the skepticism. Given the differences in emphasis and approach, the election outcome could have very different consequences for federal policy and its role in the future of rural communities."
107,Haley’s strong bid for second place in the Iowa debate,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/haleys-strong-bid-for-second-place-in-the-iowa-debate/,"William A. Galston, Elaine Kamarck","January 11, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Going into the Republican debate in Iowa the race remained, as it has all year, Trump’s to lose. Trump maintains a formidable lead among Republican voters — 61% and no one even comes close — Gov. Ron DeSantis and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley are tied at around 10% of the vote. That’s also the story when it comes to money where Trump has been way ahead of the field. At the end of the third quarter Trump had raised twice as much as DeSantis and about three times as much as Haley. Trump’s lead, while still huge, is a bit less in the early primary states. In Iowa, Trump is at around 52% with DeSantis and Haley close to each other but still under 20% in most polls. DeSantis has put everything he has into Iowa — a loss there may well doom his campaign going forward. In a campaign nothing is more valuable to a candidate than free media. And on that metric as well our tracker shows that Trump is far ahead of his opponents. In fact, he gets more free media than the incumbent president of the United States.
Because of Trump’s overwhelming lead, the race has been and remains today a race for the number two slot, with the possibility looming that someone could emerge to take on Trump for the nomination. Along the way many, candidates have dropped out. The latest is former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, whose full-throated attacks on Trump gained him great admiration from Democrats and a small number of Republicans — though too small a number to make winning the nomination feasible for him. But where his support goes could have a major impact on voting in New Hampshire.
So last night the race came down to three people: Trump, who refused to debate but who, as in other Republican debates, conducted his own event on Fox News; Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis; and former Ambassador Nikki Haley.
On Fox TV
On the Fox town hall, Trump was toned down. With the first votes of the season only days away, it looked as if he was working hard to reassure voters that he would be a safe choice rather than a threat to political institutions or to his enemies. Surprisingly, he pulled back on his often-repeated promise to deliver “retribution” for the perceived wrong perpetrated against him and his supporters. “I’ll be too busy for retribution,” he said. And besides, success is the best retribution. If he maintains this demeanor, which he has not been able to do in the past, he could prove to be a more formidable general election candidate than many Democrats believe.
Looking ahead to the general election, Trump previewed the case he would make. Paraphrasing his message, it went something like this: Under my leadership, we had a strong economy, low inflation, low gas prices, and energy independence. There were no new wars on my watch, and I had Iran on the ropes. I rebuilt the military and carried out a policy of peace through strength. I’ve been accused of being the chaos candidate, but Biden is the real chaos candidate. Look at the economy, the border, the outbreak of war and instability. This wouldn’t have happened on my watch. And Biden’s electric vehicle mandate makes no sense; soon China will be building most of them.
Trump offered relatively few personal attacks on Biden. He referred only once to Biden’s alleged mental decline and claimed in passing, without providing any evidence, that the president had gotten money from China and the wife of Moscow’s mayor. Trump conveyed confidence that he could run successfully on his record and that Biden’s weaknesses would speak for themselves.
Prompted by voters’ questions, he offered vague glimpses of his plans for a second term. He promised to finish the wall, shut down the southern border, reinstitute the “Remain in Mexico” policy, and undertake the biggest deportation effort in the nation’s history. Asked what he would do about sanctuary cities, he predicted that Democratic mayors would take the lead to end them because the cost of caring for illegal immigrants was prohibitive.
Toward the end of the town hall, a woman who opposes abortion told Trump that she was troubled by his attack on DeSantis’s six-week limit on abortion. He replied, as he has before, that if it weren’t for his Supreme Court appointments, we wouldn’t be having this discussion, adding that after just six weeks, many women don’t even know that they’re pregnant. He said that he favored “Ronald Reagan’s exceptions” for rape, incest, and the life of the mother. But he wants to leave these decisions to the governors; on this issue, he was a “federalist,” not a nationalist. He also noted that Republicans couldn’t advance this issue unless they win elections, and to do this, some compromises would be necessary.
Trump spent some time trying to dispel charges that if reelected, he would undermine democracy and the rule of law. Previously, he had said he would be a “dictator for a day,” which means issuing executive orders to close the southern border and to authorize drilling for oil in places that are now off limits. But in the town hall he walked back his earlier statement about wanting to be a dictator.
On CNN
While Trump was speaking, the race for number two was on over at CNN where Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley faced off with Christie’s departure clearly on their minds. Much of the time with them was spent throwing charges back and forth at each other about their records, seeking to gain an edge. The problem was that while the opposition researchers had clearly loaded them up with facts and figures, it was impossible for the average voter to figure out who was right and who was wrong. Haley kept directing people to a website called DeSantislies.com. This was an indication that her campaign understood that the back and forth would be tough to follow.
Both candidates, however, were polished and articulate — illustrating the fact that the trial by fire of debates does turn people into better candidates. DeSantis was a little less stiff than in previous debates and Haley was impressive in her mastery of the arguments. DeSantis kept repeating that, unlike Trump and Haley, he could deliver, and he touted his actions in Florida on a variety of fronts. But his performance suffered from a series of what were so obviously pre-packaged lines, such as: “Ballistic podiatry — shooting herself in the foot.”
Haley’s theme was that she was a new generation and that character matters. In one statement, she said, “I don’t have vengeance, I don’t have vendettas,” a clear reference to Trump’s tendency to wallow in the past and engage in grievance politics. As in previous debates, her mastery of foreign affairs stood out and helped make her look quite presidential.
In addition to dredging up examples from each other’s records to illustrate how much better they were on issues important to the Republican base (such as transgender persons, the border wall, and China), they rarely talked about Trump. When they did, they complained about his failure to enact some policy and continually maintained that Trump himself should have been on the stage. Occasionally, they paused the confusing attacks on each other and made a strong, coherent case. The Biden campaign should take note of their exchanges on immigration and be ready for what will be a powerful attack. Haley, the child of legal immigrants said, “My mother used to say, ‘If they don’t follow the laws when they come into the country, they won’t follow the laws when they are here.’”
For some reason (perhaps it tested well in Iowa), Haley pounded DeSantis for having run a poor campaign — spending $150 million with little to show for it.
And Haley came out squarely against the January 6 insurrection — saying it should never happen again, while DeSantis avoided a direct answer.
As in previous debates, none of the remaining candidates made the kind of strong case against Trump that Chris Christie has made and that Democrats and some members of the press want the remaining candidates to make. But how do they get Christie’s support without aggravating the Trump base? A serious run for the Republican nomination will require, at some point in time, converting at least a few Trump voters to their cause.
So, as the real contest begins today, we have three serious candidates remaining (not counting Vivek Ramaswamy). Trump is still dominant, Haley is ascendant and gaining steam, and DeSantis, who appeared to be in a free fall a few weeks ago, is perhaps leveling off. In recent weeks, Haley has increased her free media by 911% in our tracker — a testimony to the increased interest in her campaign as a result of her polling numbers and her strong debate performances.
In New Hampshire, Trump stands at 42% among Republicans – lower than in the national polls and lower than in Iowa. It’s there that Haley has been gaining ground since October. She now has about 30% of the vote in FiveThirtyEight’s average of polls. She runs ahead of Christie and well ahead of DeSantis. With Christie gone, Haley should get some of his vote and perhaps be able to beat Trump there (or at least come close).
The unknown but critical question is where the Christie voters will go and how much of it will benefit Haley. If she is able to consolidate the non-Trump vote in New Hampshire, the Granite State could produce a major surprise and propel her into a dramatic showdown with Trump in her home state of South Carolina on February 24.
As Haley gains momentum in New Hampshire, she picked up some wealthy supporters, among them Americans for Prosperity Action, a powerhouse group affiliated with the Koch brothers. Although we don’t have official numbers from the Federal Election Commission yet, the Haley campaign announced in December that they had attracted 83,000 new donors who contributed $24 million dollars. Of course, Trump and DeSantis have also increased their fundraising, but, if accurate, this is a significant haul for Haley, who as of the end of the third quarter had raised a total of $19 million.
Having money to run in the very expensive primaries that will take place on Super Tuesday is very important for a candidate. While the free media is priceless, it takes money to build out a campaign that runs ads and goes door-to-door in the set of big states that will vote on March 5.
As we come to the end of the invisible primary, we find a three-way race that favors Trump but with some of the ingredients that could make for a dramatic upset in coming weeks."

North America, geopolitics, and the new energy map",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/harsh-times-north-america-geopolitics-and-the-new-energy-map/,Oscar Ocampo,"March 6, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",RESEARCH,"U.S.-China trade tensions, disruptions in supply chains, the Russian-Ukraine war, and the overall instability in the global order, have underscored the value of the predictability offered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) framework at the regional level. What is to be done to harness this revival of the “North American idea”?
North America in a regionalized world
The regionalization trend that has emerged given the uncertain geopolitical environment is here to stay, at least in the foreseeable future. It is time to return to Robert Pastor’s North American idea,1 an understanding of the continent as a community of three countries whose prosperity depends on their capacity to cooperate and jointly produce goods and services and address security threats. There is a long road ahead. In her most recent book “The Globalization Myth,” Shannon O’Neil demonstrates that 40% of North American trade is intraregional. This figure is significantly lower than in the European Union (approximately two-thirds) or Asia (around 59%).2 The push for regionalization in North America has the potential to change that landscape. Developing a North American approach on energy cooperation is an indispensable condition to capitalize on this opportunity. The approach must be part of a broader agenda to build more resilient and secure supply chains, where access to clean, competitive, and reliable energy plays a pivotal role.
Former United States Trade Representative and World Bank President Robert Zoellick has underscored this: Unlike the process of European integration, the North American approach has not relied on sharing sovereignty or on supranational institutions. Zoellick comments that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) “encouraged mutuality, frameworks for deeper cooperation and attention to shared interests.”3 This is especially true for the energy sector. North America’s most logical pathway to more integrated energy markets is to strengthen collaboration at the technical level (e.g., mutual recognition of technical standards), on regulatory harmonization, and on the development of transnational energy infrastructure.
The U.S.-Canada side letter on energy within the USMCA framework could be a stepping stone towards a more ambitious framework for regional cooperation. Mexico should adhere to the side letter that respects the spirit of North American integration as understood by Zoellick; It fosters regulatory cooperation and transparency specifically regarding access to transmission facilities and pipeline networks without sharing sovereignty on decision making processes.
North American energy security
In a world where energy security has regained a central position, North America’s reliable energy sources with low emissions at competitive prices represent a major economic advantage for investment in the industries of the future (e.g., semiconductors, data centers, artificial intelligence, and electromobility).
The International Energy Agency (IEA) defines energy security as “the uninterrupted availability of energy sources at an affordable price.”4 The IEA distinguishes between long- and short-term energy security. Long-term energy security requires sufficient investment in infrastructure to keep pace with economic growth and development, while short-term energy security refers to “the ability of the energy system to react promptly to sudden changes in the supply-demand balance.”5 Both short- and long-term energy security can be realized in North America. With respect to the supply of energy, the region benefits from geographic and climatic diversity that allows it to be competitive on multiple fronts, including solar, wind, nuclear generation, as well as natural gas. A balanced energy matrix composed of multiple technologies is a key requirement for energy security. However, despite this privileged energy “endowment,” North America needs to further invest in developing its energy resources as well as in energy infrastructure, including low-emission power generation, grid expansion and modernization, and natural gas infrastructure (e.g., storage and transportation). USMCA facilitates the goal of energy security by reducing barriers to trade in energy technologies which lowers costs and expands access to energy services. Many of the energy investments needed in North America are also large scale and long-term assets. The impact of USMCA on the business environment, reducing regulatory risk and increasing investment certainty, can reduce the cost of these investments.
One region, three visions
There is currently no vision for how to achieve energy security in North America. Each country is promoting eff orts to expand energy infrastructure with different visions and varying degrees of ambition. The U.S. leads the way with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), which are expected to trigger over $1 trillion in new investments in energy infrastructure by 2035. It is mostly related to the decarbonization of economic activities according to Princeton University’s Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit, although this estimate might be conservative. The U.S. industrial policy has also focused on energy storage technologies with over $70 billion in investment commitments for electric vehicles and battery development within the framework of the IRA.6 Simultaneously, though, new natural gas projects are facing increased scrutiny. Ultimately, North America needs an energy matrix that guarantees the reliability of the system while reducing the region’s carbon footprint, which will include an ongoing role for natural gas and the virtual elimination of coal and other highly polluting fuels.7
Canada has developed an energy roadmap and is currently discussing a bill in Parliament to enact investment tax credits for clean energies (expected to be as high as C$27 billion), including renewable power generation, hydrogen, as well as carbon capture and storage.8 Additionally, Canada is promoting expanding its pipeline infrastructure, despite heated debates given social and environmental concerns.
Mexico’s energy sector is in disarray and needs a significant new policy direction and greater coordination with its North American partners. The Mexican administration’s energy policy has been focused on supporting PEMEX and expanding investment in carbon intensive energy sources such as oil, discouraging investment in renewable energy. After five years of discouraging private investment in power generation, Mexico lags in terms of clean energy (in October 2023, only slightly over 20% of generation was clean) and the electric system overall is facing increasing pressures given the growth in demand driven by nearshoring and the electrification of the economy.9 Public investment—CFE’s new combined cycle plants and the landmark Plan Sonora—is proving to be insufficient in replacing private investment.10 Conversely, on the natural gas front, the Federal Government has opted to partner with the private sector to continue the expansion of the pipeline network, prominently in Mexico’s south/southeastern region. Mexico’s geographical location, its network of free trade agreements, and its technically skilled labor force should allow the country’s manufacturers to benefit from U.S. initiatives like the IRA and the CHIPS and Science Act. However, lack of access to clean, competitive, and reliable energy supply limits Mexican possibilities to make the most of nearshoring.
As outlined previously, energy policy remains domestically focused. There is no North American vision for the energy sector. The absence of such a vision means missed opportunities to increase energy security and build resilience into energy infrastructure and supply, such as expanding transnational transmission and generation. The construction of the high-voltage direct current transmission line from Quebec to New York City is an example of this.11 When it starts operating–expected in 2026—the project will transport clean energy (wind and hydro) across borders, reducing grid congestion as well as lowering electricity rates and emissions in New York City and Long Island. Moreover, the absence of a North American vision risks divergent approaches to clean energy across North America, which could become a trade issue as governments begin to prioritize clean energy products. For instance, the steps by the U.S. and the European Union (EU) towards a Global Arrangement on Sustainable Steel and Aluminum (GASSA) point to an emerging approach to trade in clean energy, steel, and aluminum with implications for North America.
Funding energy infrastructure in North America
On the financial side, the North American Development Bank (NADBank) could prove to be a suitable funding mechanism for the development of transnational energy infrastructure projects in the three countries. Expanding its mandate beyond the U.S.-Mexico border and increasing its capitalization would be the first steps towards this goal.12 NADBank should become a proper regional development bank specialized in energy and logistical infrastructure. The institution could prioritize investments in low-emission power generation capacity, transmission lines, and natural gas pipelines, accompanied by logistical infrastructure that enables the movement of goods between the countries.
Investments must go beyond strictly energy infrastructure. Logistical infrastructure should also be strengthened, with a special focus on the Gulf of Mexico to enhance connectivity among the energy clusters located both in the U.S. and Mexico, including modernizing ports, as well as roads and railroads in the surrounding states.
Developing competitive energy infrastructure should not be reduced to the USMCA partners. An indispensable condition for the sustained success of North America as a region is development in Central America. Hence, it is indispensable to promote investment south of the Suchiate River. There are difficulties on two main fronts: politics and finance. On the political front, a trilateral vision for the region that goes beyond energy would be needed. In addition, the economic and national security benefits of development in Central America (e.g., coproduction of goods, lower migration, new markets) would need to be stressed.
North America and the energy transition
The dilemma on energy security is not limited to availability, it also entails the environmental footprint of the energy matrix. Balancing the energy matrix to reduce North American emissions requires a gradual transition towards renewable energies and natural gas as a transition fuel. Natural gas emissions per million British Thermal Units are 53.1 Kg, while coal, fuel oil, and diesel emit 95.5, 75.1, 74.0 Kg of CO2 respectively.13
North America must decidedly decommission highly polluting facilities in favor of low-emission technologies. As shown in Table 5, in 2020, natural gas represented 36.5% of the region’s primary energy matrix while clean energies (e.g., nuclear, solar, wind, hydro, and biofuels) accounted for 19.3%. Nonetheless, coal still represented 9.6% and oil, 34.5%. The room for improvement cannot be overstated.
The ideas proposed in this chapter are consistent with the global imperative to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to mitigate climate change and to develop a pathway to energy security across North America. The three countries have set ambitious greenhouse gas mitigation targets by 2030. The U.S. national determined contribution (NDC) is to reduce net GHG emissions by 50-52% to 2005 levels, Canada aims to reduce GHG emissions by 40-45% compared to 2005, and Mexico committed to reduce GHG emissions by 35% compared to the government’s baseline scenario (inertial emission growth scenario)."
110,A way forward on a US-Saudi civil nuclear agreement,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/a-way-forward-on-a-us-saudi-civil-nuclear-agreement/,Robert Einhorn,"April 12, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",RESEARCH,"The Biden administration has responded positively to Saudi Arabia’s interest in civil nuclear cooperation with the United States—both because such cooperation is a Saudi condition for the normalization of Saudi-Israeli relations, which the administration strongly supports, and because it believes a bilateral civil nuclear partnership can bring important benefits to both countries. However, such cooperation needs to be pursued in a way that can realize those benefits without increasing the risks of nuclear proliferation.
A civil nuclear deal between the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) could serve ambitious Saudi nuclear energy and commercial goals and help revitalize the U.S. nuclear industry. It could authorize a wide range of cooperative activities, including a lead role for U.S. companies in building the first phase of Saudi nuclear reactors and a Saudi investment in a U.S.-based uranium enrichment operation, which could help reduce U.S. reliance on importing enriched uranium from Russia.
Given the lack of any near-term programmatic or commercial justification for a uranium enrichment program in Saudi Arabia, the nuclear agreement should not authorize the U.S. construction of an enrichment facility in the kingdom, which would be a departure from longstanding U.S. non-proliferation policy. But during a moratorium period of perhaps 10 years, the parties should conduct a continuing review of the enrichment issue and keep open the option of constructing an enrichment facility in Saudi Arabia at a future time.
Deferring the question of domestic enrichment would enable Saudi Arabia and the United States to embark on mutually beneficial nuclear cooperation without raising concerns about proliferation or closing the door to future Saudi fuel cycle choices.
Long-standing U.S. policy on transferring fuel cycle technologies
A bilateral U.S.-Saudi agreement on civil nuclear cooperation is one of the KSA’s declared conditions for its normalization with Israel—along with U.S. security guarantees and a pathway to statehood for the Palestinians. Saudi officials maintain that such cooperation should include the U.S. construction of a uranium enrichment facility in Saudi Arabia—a facility capable of producing low-enriched uranium to fuel civil nuclear reactors but, if not subject to effective controls, capable of producing highly enriched uranium for use in nuclear weapons.
The Saudis point out that a domestic enrichment capability would enable the KSA to take advantage of the uranium deposits on its territory to provide fuel for its planned nuclear reactor program as well as to profit from the sale of uranium products on the international market. But a domestic enrichment program may have more than commercial and nuclear energy value for the kingdom. Given statements by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and other senior Saudi officials that the KSA is determined to acquire nuclear weapons if Iran does, Saudi interest in enrichment is viewed internationally as related to that strategic goal.
For decades, a central component of U.S. non-proliferation policy has been opposition to the proliferation of uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing (known as “fuel cycle”) capabilities. In addition to refusing to transfer fuel cycle equipment and technology to other countries, the United States has actively worked to discourage other nuclear supplier states from selling those technologies and potential recipient states from importing them. In negotiations in recent years on agreements for civil nuclear cooperation with other countries, Washington has sought a binding commitment not to pursue fuel cycle capabilities (often referred to as the “gold standard”)—but obtained such a commitment only in the case of its agreement with the United Arab Emirates.
U.S. support for an enrichment facility in the kingdom could adversely affect the global non-proliferation regime even if adequate non-proliferation guardrails could be put in place to effectively preclude the possibility of contributing to a Saudi nuclear weapons capability. After saying “yes” to Saudi Arabia, how could the United States say “no” to a treaty ally like South Korea, which has tried without success to gain U.S. consent to enrichment on its territory? How could the United States dissuade Russia, China, or others from offering their customers an enrichment plant to sweeten their bids to sell nuclear reactors—and from making such an offer without insisting on the kinds of restrictions the United States would insist on to prevent diversion to a nuclear weapons program?
U.S. policy to prevent the proliferation of fuel cycle capabilities has been very successful. Since the demise about 20 years ago of the black-market network led by Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan, which provided enrichment technology to Iran, North Korea, Libya, and perhaps others, there have been no known transfers of fuel cycle technologies to countries that do not possess them, either by state or non-state suppliers. It has been much longer since any state-sanctioned transfer of fuel cycle technology to a non-nuclear weapon state. Building an enrichment facility in the kingdom would be seen as a major reversal of U.S. nonproliferation policy.
During 2023, as part of its effort to address Saudi conditions for normalization with Israel, the Biden administration engaged in high-level, very closely held discussions with the KSA on civil nuclear cooperation. The two sides reportedly made significant headway in developing the broad outlines of a deal. But the Hamas attack on October 7 and the ensuing war in Gaza were widely assumed to put progress toward both normalization and a nuclear cooperation agreement on indefinite hold.
Apparently, that is not the case. Both Washington and Riyadh seem inclined to press forward, both on a civil nuclear deal as well as on the broader package that would facilitate normalization with Israel. Indeed, they appear to see urgency in reaching a broad agreement in the next few months before the U.S. elections complicate the process.
So, the Biden administration is now grappling with the challenge of responding positively to the Saudi demand for nuclear assistance—and thereby meeting a key Saudi requirement for normalization with Israel—while at the same time avoiding damage to U.S. non-proliferation interests.
Insisting on the “gold standard” would be a non-proliferation loss
Media reports regarding U.S.-Saudi nuclear negotiations have raised concerns in the United States, especially regarding the prospect of an enrichment facility in Saudi Arabia. In separate letters to President Joe Biden, a bipartisan group of non-proliferation and regional experts and a group of 20 Democratic senators both called on the administration to condition any U.S.-Saudi civil nuclear deal on a binding KSA commitment to forswear enrichment and reprocessing capabilities. In light of the declared Saudi intention to match any Iranian nuclear weapons capability, the two groups argued that failure to insist on the gold standard could lead to a Saudi nuclear weapons capability and a regional arms race.
From a non-proliferation perspective, it would clearly be best if Saudi Arabia accepted the gold standard and renounced fuel cycle capabilities. However, in negotiations on a bilateral civil nuclear agreement, both the Obama and Trump administrations pressed the Saudis for the gold standard but were firmly and repeatedly rebuffed. Most observers see no possibility of the Saudis reconsidering their position.
Insisting on a binding renunciation of fuel cycle capabilities would ensure that there would be no civil nuclear deal. The United States would forfeit any involvement in the KSA’s nuclear program, including the window it would provide into Saudi capabilities and plans and the opportunity to exert influence on aspects of the program related to non-proliferation, safeguards, safety, and security. The kingdom would turn to other nuclear supplier governments, including those that would be less demanding than the United States in terms of technology transfer restrictions, safeguards, and other non-proliferation controls. Instead of achieving a significant non-proliferation gain, pressing for the gold standard could result in a major non-proliferation loss.
Seeking a civil nuclear partnership with the KSA
Rather than excluding itself from any role in the Saudi nuclear program, the United States should pursue a broad public-private civil nuclear partnership with the KSA that could serve Saudi nuclear energy and commercial goals as well as help revitalize the U.S. nuclear industry and reduce American dependence on Russian enriched uranium—and could do so consistent with U.S. non-proliferation interests. Such a partnership would require Washington and Riyadh to negotiate a bilateral agreement for civil nuclear cooperation (called a “123 agreement” after Section 123 of the U.S. Atomic Energy Act), which would permit American and Saudi private and public entities to engage in a wide range of cooperative activities.
One such activity could be uranium conversion. The parties could agree that the United States would help the KSA build a uranium conversion facility in the kingdom, which would convert Saudi chemically processed uranium ore into the gaseous form of uranium (uranium hexafluoride, or UF6) used as the feed material for centrifuge enrichment. The Saudis could then sell their converted uranium on the international market, which is currently in short supply of UF6. Some could be shipped to the United States, where it could be enriched in a U.S.-based enrichment facility and used to fuel U.S. nuclear reactors, sent back to KSA to fuel future Saudi reactors, or sold to third countries.
A major component of the partnership could be U.S. support for the KSA’s ambitious plans for building nuclear reactors in the kingdom. Washington and Riyadh could agree that U.S. companies would play the leading role in the first phase of constructing Saudi nuclear reactors, including both large, conventional nuclear power reactors as well as small modular reactors (SMRs) which could be used for power generation, process heat, desalination, and other industrial purposes. American reactor vendors would provide the fuels for the reactors they build and perhaps could eventually train Saudi technicians to fabricate the fuels indigenously.
Another important element of the partnership could be Saudi acquisition of a stake in a U.S.-based enrichment operation. The Biden administration is determined to reduce and ultimately eliminate the United States’ reliance on Russian enriched uranium, which accounts for roughly a quarter of the enriched uranium used in the United States today. In December 2023, the House of Representatives passed legislation that would ban imports of enriched uranium from Russia by 2028. The Senate is expected to adopt the ban and Biden is expected to sign it into law. Yet current U.S. enrichment capacity is insufficient to replace imports from Russia; a significant expansion would be required.
To promote U.S. energy security, Congress has appropriated $2.72 billion to boost domestic enrichment capacity. While that level of government support will not suffice to finance a major new U.S. enrichment plant, it should give confidence to private U.S. investors to make up the difference. Still, foreign investors could play an important role. A Saudi investment in a U.S.-based enrichment company—which, depending on the terms of the arrangement, could entitle the KSA to receive an allocation of the enriched uranium product—could reduce the burden on U.S. public and private investors, help increase U.S. enrichment capacity, and reduce U.S. vulnerability to Russia. At the same time, it could provide Saudi Arabia with valuable experience in the enrichment business as well as furnish it with a reliable supply of enriched uranium that it could use to fuel its own reactors or market to third countries.
The question of domestic enrichment in the KSA
An issue sure to arise in U.S.-Saudi negotiations on civil nuclear cooperation is whether the nuclear deal, in addition to enabling the KSA to acquire a stake in a U.S.-based enrichment company, should authorize the near-term construction by the United States of an enrichment plant in the kingdom, which Saudi officials have reportedly called for.
When looked at from a programmatic or commercial perspective, the early pursuit of domestic enrichment in Saudi Arabia is hard to justify. The KSA is years away from operating nuclear reactors that could run on domestically enriched uranium fuel. Moreover, starting soon to build an enrichment facility in the hope of reaping substantial financial rewards as an enriched uranium exporter would be a risky business decision—especially when future market conditions are hard to predict and the prospects for lining up customers in competition with several established and highly-efficient foreign enrichment operators are uncertain.
For the time being, it would seem preferable for the KSA to gain technical and business experience extracting and processing its uranium resources, producing and marketing UF6, obtaining reliable access to enriched uranium by investing in U.S.-based enrichment, and building and operating nuclear reactors to diversify its sources of energy—all of which would provide a much sounder basis for evaluating the merits of pursuing domestic enrichment at a later stage.
The U.S.-Saudi deal currently under negotiation should therefore not provide for the construction of a uranium enrichment facility in the kingdom—at least not for now. But it should not close the door on domestic enrichment. Instead, it should call on the two parties to keep the question of fuel cycle activities in the kingdom, especially enrichment, under continuing review. A bilateral mechanism could be established that would meet on a regular basis to conduct the fuel cycle review. During the review period—perhaps 10 years—there would be a moratorium on enrichment and reprocessing in Saudi Arabia. During that period, the United States would not assist the KSA in those fuel cycle activities; nor would Saudi Arabia pursue them indigenously or with the help of other countries. At the end of the moratorium, Washington and Riyadh would make a joint determination on whether to renew or end it.
Incorporating appropriate safeguards
Like U.S. civil nuclear agreements with other countries, the U.S.-Saudi civil nuclear partnership would contain provisions designed to prevent the diversion of U.S. assistance to a nuclear weapons program. Many of these provisions are required by Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act itself or found in the guidelines of the multilateral Nuclear Suppliers Group. Among the key provisions, non-nuclear weapon states partnering with the United States must: have a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) covering all their nuclear facilities and activities; obtain U.S. consent for reprocessing or enriching U.S.-supplied materials or for retransferring U.S.-supplied equipment or materials to third countries; and apply adequate physical security measures to U.S.-supplied nuclear materials and facilities. In addition, in the event that a cooperation partner detonates a nuclear device or violates an IAEA safeguards agreement using materials or equipment supplied by the United States, Washington would have the right to demand the return of any transferred equipment or materials.
Given concerns about the potential for nuclear proliferation in the Middle East—not to mention Saudi statements about matching Iran’s nuclear capabilities—it would be desirable for the U.S.-Saudi civil nuclear deal to contain supplementary measures. In addition to a basic IAEA Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement, which is required by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the KSA should accept an IAEA Additional Protocol, which gives the Vienna-based agency additional monitoring and inspection tools and which more than 140 countries have already accepted. It should also forswear the separation of plutonium from spent reactor fuel, ship plutonium-bearing spent fuel out of the country, and agree not to maintain an inventory of UF6 in excess of current commercial or domestic needs.
Possible domestic hurdles in the United States
A U.S.-Saudi nuclear deal could face hurdles domestically. Some Americans, such as the senators and experts signing the letters mentioned earlier, could be expected to oppose the agreement for not including a permanent Saudi renunciation of fuel cycle capabilities. Others might oppose any nuclear agreement with the Saudi government on the grounds that it had made clear its intention to acquire nuclear weapons if Iran does and had engaged in serious human rights violations, particularly the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Several factors could help overcome such domestic opposition. The perception that the nuclear deal is critical to achieving Saudi-Israeli normalization—a development likely to have wide bipartisan support in the United States—would strengthen the deal’s domestic prospects. Effective monitoring measures, the absence of authorization for near-term uranium enrichment in the KSA, and a strong case that nuclear cooperation would create American jobs and benefit U.S. industry would similarly bolster the deal’s chances.
Israeli support, or at least acquiescence, would also improve the deal’s domestic reception. Reportedly, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is prepared to go along with a U.S.-Saudi nuclear agreement, even one that provides for enrichment, presumably because he views it as critical to realizing normalization, one of his top priorities. Other Israelis, however, including opposition figure Yair Lapid, have said they would oppose a deal that allows for Saudi enrichment. Nevertheless, a deal that facilitated normalization without providing for a Saudi enrichment facility would likely be received favorably in Israel.
The rather permissive entry-into-force procedure for 123 agreements would also greatly improve the deal’s prospects. If, after a lengthy period of congressional review, the Congress fails to pass a joint resolution of disapproval—which would require a supermajority to override an expected presidential veto—the 123 agreement would automatically take effect. This is a very high bar for opponents to block the deal.
A nuclear deal involving Saudi investment in a U.S. enrichment (or conversion) company could face another kind of hurdle: domestic concern that the investment would give a foreign company or country (and specifically a country like Saudi Arabia with a tarnished reputation in the United States) undue influence in an area of national security importance. The deal could prompt scrutiny and conceivably opposition from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) or the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), both of which have statutory responsibilities to investigate cases of foreign ownership or control of U.S. businesses.
However, any reviews carried out by the NRC or CFIUS are unlikely to result in a decision to block a proposed Saudi investment. The Saudi and American entities involved in the transaction, as well as U.S. officials, would be well aware of potential concerns over foreign ownership, control, or influence (abbreviated as FOCI) and would seek to ensure, often in consultation with the reviewing organizations, that the amount of investment, the structuring of the arrangement, and the Saudi role will not rise to a level that could trigger a decision to disallow the transaction.
The civil nuclear deal recommended here would not be without controversy in the United States, but domestic opposition is unlikely to derail it.
The difficulties of seeking to authorize near-term KSA domestic enrichment
In the kingdom, the deal described above may not go far enough for those who support domestic enrichment soon, whether for commercial reasons or an interest in having in place the infrastructure that would provide an option to pursue nuclear weapons at some future time. But an agreement authorizing an enrichment facility on Saudi soil would involve many more restrictions and potential political hurdles.
To prevent the transfer of enrichment technology—which the Biden administration considers a red line—the Saudi-based enrichment plant would have to be operated exclusively by Americans. No Saudis would be given access to the facility or would otherwise be authorized to receive enrichment technology.
IAEA safeguards would have to be more rigorous and intrusive, going beyond the Additional Protocol, with enhanced verification measures such as those contained in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action negotiated with Iran, perhaps including monitoring of uranium mining, milling, and conversion and more frequent IAEA inspector access to sensitive facilities.
Special arrangements might also be considered necessary to address the concern that the Saudi government could in the future decide to nationalize or physically take over the enrichment facility. For example, U.S. military personnel could be stationed at or near the enrichment facility as a deterrent. There has also been speculation about installing a remote shutdown mechanism or even using covert means to disable the plant in the event of a takeover.
Another complication is that a nuclear agreement authorizing the near-term construction of an enrichment plant in the KSA would attract more U.S. domestic criticism than an agreement that didn’t. A few years ago, a bipartisan group of members of Congress with strong reservations about U.S.-Saudi nuclear cooperation, including Senators Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Representatives Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) and Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), introduced a bill that would require a U.S.-Saudi 123 agreement to receive majority votes in both houses of Congress. In polarized Washington, this would make entry into force much more difficult, especially compared with the normal procedure allowing entry into force in the absence of a joint resolution of disapproval. The proposed bill did not become law, but opponents of a nuclear deal would now have a controversial new issue—the enrichment facility—to help them resurrect and build support for their initiative to make blocking the 123 agreement much easier.
Moreover, the congressional review process as well as the broader public debate on the agreement, especially its authorization of an enrichment facility in the KSA, would be highly contentious, with strong criticism of Saudi Arabia, and not just on the nuclear issue. Whether or not the agreement survived the congressional review, U.S.-KSA bilateral relations could take a serious hit.
Given these considerations—as well as the lack of any compelling commercial or nuclear energy justification for proceeding with a domestic enrichment facility at this stage—it would seem preferable to conclude a 123 agreement that stops short of authorizing near-term enrichment and instead defers the question of enrichment to a later date.
Time is running short for U.S.-Saudi and Saudi-Israeli agreements in 2024
The Biden administration would like to reach an agreement by early summer on Saudi conditions for the normalization of Israeli-Saudi relations: a U.S. security guarantee to the kingdom, a pathway to Palestinian statehood, and a U.S.-Saudi civil nuclear agreement. But time is growing short, and the prospects for finalizing agreements and gaining any necessary formal approval of them (e.g., a binding U.S. security guarantee) will deteriorate as the election year proceeds.
The continuation of the war in Gaza has impeded the U.S.-Saudi negotiations’ timely completion. It is hard to imagine agreement on the Palestinian issue being reached while the war rages. And it is hardly a propitious time for the United States and the KSA to unveil and seek domestic support for a significantly upgraded bilateral security relationship.
Washington and Riyadh (and Jerusalem) have hoped to have the U.S.-Saudi agreements and consequently Saudi-Israeli normalization wrapped up concurrently. The assumption has been that the various elements would be mutually reinforcing—for example, normalization would make nuclear cooperation with the KSA more palatable to Israel, and a U.S. security guarantee and nuclear cooperation would make normalization more palatable to the kingdom.
However, with the process delayed, consideration might be given to moving ahead with parts of the package independently when they are ready. The logical candidate would be civil nuclear cooperation, which is less affected by the war in Gaza than the other elements. A reasonable case can be made that a stand-alone U.S.-Saudi 123 agreement along the lines outlined here would serve both U.S. and Saudi interests, even in the absence of Saudi-Israeli normalization.
But if the normal congressional review and entry-into-force procedure is followed—requiring the agreement to sit before Congress for 90 days of continuous session, which can extend well beyond 90 calendar days—it will be hard to complete the review process this year unless the agreement is submitted in the next month or so. And if it is not completed during the current session of Congress, the agreement would have to be resubmitted to the next Congress in January 2025 and the 90-day continuous session clock would start again.
Alternatively, if the administration wanted to bypass the normal 90-day process and achieve an early entry into force, it could seek an affirmative vote of approval from Congress, but gaining such an affirmative vote would be politically much more difficult.
Even if the 123 agreement is finalized soon, however, bringing it into force as a stand-alone nuclear deal seems unlikely. The Biden administration may well be reluctant to submit it to Congress in the absence of an agreement on Saudi-Israeli normalization, which it believes could boost political support for U.S.-Saudi civil nuclear cooperation.
If Washington, Riyadh, and Jerusalem are unable to conclude the package of agreements by early summer—and become concerned by the prospect of not reaching an outcome this year—they could try to draft a joint statement or statements containing the key elements of what they have agreed to date. While not binding, such a framework arrangement or arrangements could increase the likelihood that the progress already achieved would be the starting point for finishing the package in the new year.
A mutually beneficial agreement that minimizes proliferation risks
A U.S.-Saudi civil nuclear agreement along the lines outlined here—authorizing a wide range of cooperative activities in the near term while deferring the issue of domestic enrichment in the kingdom—would serve both sides’ interests.
For the Saudis, it would be a major step in diversifying their economy and energy mix and advancing other Vision 2030 goals. Cooperating with the United States in building nuclear reactors, engaging in such activities as producing and marketing UF6, and acquiring a stake in a U.S.-based enrichment operation would be critical steps in helping the KSA to establish a world-class nuclear energy program and become a player in the global nuclear supply chain.
Deferring the issue of domestic enrichment in Saudi Arabia would avoid a premature and potentially risky business decision and provide time for the Saudis to evaluate a range of factors bearing on the merits of enriching domestically, including evolving market conditions, the rate of construction of Saudi reactors requiring enriched uranium fuels, and the prospects for developing a customer base for Saudi enriched uranium exports. The nuclear agreement recommended here would keep open the option of domestic enrichment for future consideration.
A U.S.-Saudi nuclear deal would also have implications for Saudi interests beyond the civil nuclear sphere. Together with a new U.S. security guarantee that is likely to accompany it, a long-term civil nuclear partnership would give a major boost to the U.S.-Saudi bilateral relationship, with positive effects on Saudi security and regional stability.
Moreover, deferring the issue of domestic enrichment would avoid a decision that could raise suspicions of Saudi intentions and provide incentives for other countries to engage in nuclear hedging by pursuing their own fuel cycle programs. It would also buy time for Saudi leaders to evaluate the implications for Saudi security of such developments as Israeli-Saudi normalization, a new U.S. security guarantee, and the evolution of the Iranian threat—and to consider how such developments affect any perceived need to put in place the infrastructure to produce nuclear weapons.
For the United States, a bilateral civil nuclear cooperation deal that gives U.S. companies the lead in building Saudi reactors and provides Saudi financial support for expanding U.S. domestic enrichment capacity would deliver a much-needed boost to the U.S. nuclear industry, better position it to play a major role in the anticipated expansion of nuclear energy both domestically and globally, and reduce U.S. reliance on Russia. Together with an upgraded U.S. security assurance to the kingdom, it would strengthen the bilateral relationship and have a stabilizing effect in the region.
In addition, by maintaining close U.S. involvement in Saudi civil nuclear programs, a deal would provide valuable insights into Saudi nuclear thinking and an opportunity to influence future Saudi nuclear choices. It would help ensure that the Saudi civil nuclear program would meet the highest non-proliferation, safety, and security standards; place a moratorium on sensitive fuel cycle activities in the kingdom; and preclude fuel-cycle cooperation between Saudi Arabia and other countries.
The approach to a U.S.-Saudi civil nuclear deal recommended here—particularly the deferral of the enrichment issue—would not fully satisfy those who would like the Saudis to permanently forswear the capacity to produce nuclear weapons. Nor would it fully satisfy those in the kingdom who would like, without delay, to give themselves a more credible option to decide at some future time to acquire nuclear weapons. It is a practical compromise that temporarily precludes Saudi fuel cycle activities but keeps future options open. Setting aside the difficult enrichment issue for future consideration allows Saudi Arabia and the United States to engage soon in mutually beneficial civil nuclear activities."
111,Taxing the wealthy in fair and efficient ways,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/taxing-the-wealthy-in-fair-and-efficient-ways/,"Ian Berlin, William G. Gale, Kyle Pomerleau","November 18, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",RESEARCH,"Tax policy discussions regarding the wealthy typically focus on how much affluent households should pay relative to other households. For example, President Biden stated, “Let’s make corporations and wealthy Americans start paying their fair share” in his 2022 State of the Union address. Similarly, criticism of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) often centers on how it disproportionately reduced taxes for high-income households.
These arguments agree that the wealthy should pay more in taxes, but the current debate has focused less on how to structure the taxation of high-income households. The structure of taxes is important because while typical American households primarily earn income in the form of wages and salaries, affluent households typically receive a much greater share of their income in the form of returns to capital. As a result, the taxation of these households can have a meaningful impact on neutrality and efficiency of the overall tax code.
The taxation of the wealthy can create distortions which can influence numerous taxpayer choices and thus affect economic efficiency and horizontal equity. Although changes to the tax system over the past several decades have greatly reduced these economic distortions, there is still room for improvement. Fundamental tax reform could further reduce or eliminate these distortions.
How the affluent earn their income
In general, households can earn both labor and capital income. Labor income includes wages, salaries, and fringe benefits. Fringe benefits are payments to, or on behalf of, workers in lieu of cash and can include health insurance, transportation, entertainment, and club memberships. Further, employers make several payments on behalf of workers, such as contributions to government social programs like Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance. Capital income is the return a household receives from assets, and it can come in several forms. Households may earn interest income, rents, royalties, corporate dividends, capital gains, pass-through business profits, and returns to pensions.
In the aggregate, most income earned by households in the United States is labor compensation. In 2023, about 69% of net factor income was labor compensation (either wages, salaries, or fringe benefits).1 Various forms of capital income constitute the remaining 31%. The largest components of capital income are corporate profits (13.4% of national income) and proprietor’s income (9% of national income). The remaining capital income comes from net interest and imputed rental income from homeowner-occupied housing (8% of national income).
Most Americans receive almost all their income through wages and retirement income (pensions, section 401(k) plans, Social Security, and IRAs) (Figure 1). The most recent available IRS data (2014) show that wages and retirement income made up 93% of adjusted gross income (AGI) for households in the bottom 80% of the income distribution. Even for households in the 98th to 99th income percentile, wages and retirement income accounted for 71% of AGI."

Coinciding with the passage of this legislation, the United States is experiencing a $525 billion private investment surge in “strategic sectors,” which we define as clean energy, semiconductors and electronics, biomanufacturing, and other advanced industries.
One notable aspect of the many programs these laws fund is their inclusion of special incentives targeted to local economies that can benefit most from new industries, jobs, and economic opportunity. However, there has not yet been a full analysis of the geographic distribution of private sector investment to understand the extent to which distressed communities are benefiting from this place-based industrial strategy.
To fill this gap, this report compares the flow of strategic sector investments in distressed counties to their share of national economic activity, population, and overall private investment levels. We find that economically distressed counties are receiving a disproportionate share of private sector investment in these strategic sectors relative to their economic output and population. We also find that strategic sector investment patterns are distinctive: When compared to private investment writ large, these investments are more likely to go to distressed communities. This pattern of strategic sector investment marks a notable departure from economic growth and private investment trends in the 2010-2020 period.
Finally, we analyze commonalities across distressed communities receiving strategic sector investment, with the aim of informing how policymakers and practitioners can improve economic development outcomes in the implementation of these policies."
113,Governing the grid for the future: The case for a Federal Grid Planning Authority,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/governing-the-grid-for-the-future-the-case-for-a-federal-grid-planning-authority/,Shelley Welton,"May 22, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"The electricity grid is the backbone of a successful clean energy transition. A strong grid will connect new clean energy resources to population centers and support the electrification of transport, heating, and cooking. It will also integrate, balance, and smooth variable resources across the country, enhancing reliability in the face of mounting climate disasters. Furthermore, it will lower the cost of system transformation by enabling more robust national coordination of resources.
In this policy proposal, Shelley Welton (University of Pennsylvania-Carey School of Law and the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy) makes the case that a more fundamental reexamination of how the grid is planned and paid for is a critical prerequisite to accomplishing the rapid infrastructural shift necessary to address climate change. Most boldly, the paper traces how the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) could use its remedial authority to disallow utilities from pursuing parochial, expensive grid expansions while requiring robust regional and interregional planning and cost allocation. More modestly, it argues that applying a governance lens on the problems plaguing the grid highlights the importance and viability of numerous smaller steps that regulators could take to improve oversight and transparency in grid governance.
The grid and its transformation
The grid’s central function is to deliver power from entities that make electricity (generators) to entities that consume electricity, also known as “load.” This electricity travels first through larger transmission lines, down into smaller distribution lines that connect to homes and businesses. FERC is the primary regulator of these interstate transmission lines, whereas distribution lines are left to state regulation. Consequently, this paper’s analytical focus is on utilities under FERC’s jurisdiction: investor-owned utilities that own interstate transmission lines. In most parts of the country, Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) run the grid. These are essentially collections of utilities that have assembled to jointly manage their systems under the aegis of a non-profit operator. In other regions, utilities manage their own systems and regional transmission development occurs through loose utility collaborations. Under either structure, the system is planned and run by industry incumbents that have limited interest in facilitating change.
Simultaneously, this system is under exorbitant pressure to adapt: As reliability falters under intensifying weather events, demand for clean electricity is swelling. A December 2023 report found that “over the past year, grid planners nearly doubled the 5-year load growth forecast,” from 2.6 percent to 4.7 percent. The Biden Administration and numerous states now share an ambition to transition the U.S. electricity system to 100 percent clean energy by 2035. Yet, expert modeling shows that up to 80 percent of the benefits of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) investments in clean energy, the country’s primary legal mechanism for decarbonization, will be lost without accompanying grid upgrades. Thus, although large, the grid is not nearly large enough—or interconnected enough.
The challenge
Interconnection. For a new electricity resource to deliver power, it must first be interconnected into the grid. The process of doing so is managed by the regional grid operator—either an RTO or individual utility. When a developer wants to interconnect a new resource, it submits to its regional operator an interconnection request and is placed in an “interconnection queue.” This process for managing interconnection has caused severe challenges as new generation has shifted away from large fossil fuel generators toward smaller, more dispersed renewable energy resources. The number of interconnection requests has quintupled in the last decade, creating major backlogs in interconnection queues. In fact, there is more energy now waiting to enter the U.S. grid than there is on the grid in total. Due to ballooning costs and increasing wait times, only 21 percent of projects that enter interconnection queues get constructed.
Transmission planning. Recognizing the importance of forward planning to the development of adequate transmission capacity in the right places, FERC has long required utilities to engage in transmission planning. The regional plans emerging from these processes are supposed to consider reliability, economic, and public-policy-driven transmission needs and select a suite of regional projects to meet these needs in a cost-effective manner. These requirements are sound in theory; in practice, they have produced disappointing results. Regions rarely engage in successful interregional planning or projects and open-ended guidance for how to pay for large lines compounds planning challenges. Even if a regional or interregional project makes it through the planning and cost allocation stages, there remains the immense challenge of getting the project permitted and sited. For all of these reasons, transmission projects typically take five to 10 years to plan, develop, and construct—with some of the most effective and ambitious regional and interregional projects taking 15 or 20 years.
Reliability. A final electric grid challenge that has made headlines recently is its faltering reliability. Fingers are often pointed at renewable energy, even though there is ample modeling to suggest that a grid that runs on 80 to 90 percent renewables is entirely feasible from a reliability standpoint. One way to ensure reliability under changing conditions is better grid planning and smarter expansion. An interconnected grid is a reliable grid in the face of increasing extreme weather. Yet major regional and interregional transmission lines are rarely built, despite intensifying worries about reliability.
These challenges are grounded in governance. It is easy to trace incumbency bias as a throughline in the challenges of interconnection, transmission planning, and reliability. When it comes to interconnection, the vast quantity of new renewable energy and storage resources waiting to connect to the grid promises to lower electricity prices and force inefficient older generation out of electricity markets. This dynamic threatens incumbent generation owners who logically seek to erect hurdles to new competitions’ entry. These biases carry through to transmission planning: For example, transmission-owning utilities prefer to build smaller lines in their own footprints, so that they can include these assets in the capital base upon which they earn a generous rate of return and avoid cost allocation battles in which they might be forced to pay for upgrades owned by another utility. And utilities often propose fossil fuel construction as the cure to reliability concerns because of their historic investments and expertise in these technologies. As the public agency charged with regulating utilities, FERC has the most potential to address these governance flaws impeding a cost-effective clean energy transition.
Incrementalism is not enough. In July 2023, FERC issued an order aimed at improving regional interconnection processes. The order requires transmission providers to study projects in “clusters” rather than one by one, to increase the speed with which they do so, and to allocate upgrade costs pro rata among clustered projects. Similarly, a new transmission planning order from 2024 improves regional planning processes but does not fundamentally alter their structure or participants’ incentives for weak implementation. Outside regional processes, the Biden Administration is pursuing innovative solutions for advancing a cleaner grid outside of FERC, including the establishment of a “Grid Deployment Office” within the Department of Energy (DOE). These initiatives are all commendable but inadequate to fully redress flaws in grid governance. A stronger set of reforms is needed to fix these flaws at their source.
The proposal
Toward a Federal Grid Planning Authority. Congress should pass legislation creating a “Federal Grid Planning Authority” (FGPA) and task it with creating a national grid development plan every three years. This plan should identify all high-voltage transmission lines that are determined to cost-effectively meet the nation’s identified long-term transmission needs. FGPA planners should be required to comprehensively evaluate the benefits of all potential grid expansions at both a national and regional level, with suites of projects selected on the basis that their benefits exceed their costs. They might do so with the considerable expertise developed across DOE and the national laboratories in executing such modeling. Congress should mandate that all regional planning entities under FERC’s jurisdiction accept the national plan as the baseline for regional transmission planning and that the FGPA process include all relevant stakeholders. Congress should also confer automatic federal siting authority for every transmission project approved in the FGPA plan.
Harnessing existing public utility law. Recognizing the substantial hurdles to the timely establishment of an FGPA, the proposal outlines several ways that FERC and the DOE might pursue a reform agenda under existing law.
Maximalist interventions: FERC could wield its existing remedial authority under the Federal Power Act more forcefully by finding that regional, incumbent-led processes fail to produce just and reasonable transmission plans. Simultaneously, the DOE might work to administratively establish a new or revamped public office of grid planning along the lines proposed above for what could be established through legislation. FERC could mandate that regional planners use DOE-produced plans as the baseline from which to launch their regional planning efforts, adding local lines only where necessary to address additional needs. Such changes should be accompanied by a shift toward more scrutinizing FERC review of transmission owners’ proposed local lines. Less ambitiously, FERC might pursue this set of reforms specifically for interregional planning.
Moderate steps: FERC could adopt prudence-based review of regional transmission plans (which would evaluate the outcomes of these planning processes), clarify the hierarchy of regional planning over local planning, and fold interconnection planning into grid planning.
More meaningful tweaks: FERC could resurrect the idea of independent transmission monitors (ITMs) that would create records to help FERC evaluate the prudence and reasonability of transmission rates, open a notice of inquiry and evaluate internal RTO governance, and mandate best practices in planning."

West","September 12, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"The recent indictments of Russian individuals and sanctions against Russian entities show the risks facing America in the upcoming elections. Attorney General Merrick Garland unveiled nefarious foreign activities designed to sway the electorate and turn voters against one another. The Russian state media firm RT is accused of using AI and bots to spread propaganda videos with false narratives about crime, immigration, and the Ukraine war. Russians also have created fake sites designed to look like U.S. news organizations that promulgate misleading pro-Russian narratives.
China is also engaging in deceptive practices. On TikTok and X, a Chinese influence operation has posted videos purporting to be from U.S. voters complaining about reproductive rights, Israel, and homelessness. Some of the videos have been seen by as many as 1.5 million people before being taken down. They are part of an influence operation called “Spamoflauge,” designed to heighten American divisions and sow doubts about democratic political systems.
Iranian operatives already have hacked the emails of GOP political consultant Roger Stone. After getting access to his account, they contacted top Trump campaign officials in an effort to gain confidential information. Among the materials they supposedly acquired were the vetting files of Republican vice president nominee JD Vance and other documents.  
It is for these reasons that recent polls show that 70% of Americans “are worried about how fake news might affect the upcoming election,” and 58% already say they have been deceived by AI-generated news. More women than men indicate they have been tricked and half of young people claim they have been taken in by fake news.
Influence operations are not limited just to foreign entities but include domestic organizations and actors as well. In recent weeks, there has been a proliferation of fake pictures, videos, and narratives. For example, there are pictures of Kamala Harris in a bathing suit hugging convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, even though that never happened.
There have been numerous examples of Donald Trump being arrested by the police, dragged away by officers, and running from law enforcement, none of which actually happened. The goals of those circulating such images were to inflame Trump supporters, play to the narrative he was being mistreated, and amplify the idea that the system was rigged against him.
Trump himself has circulated false materials showing Harris speaking before a communist rally with a large hammer and sickle insignia hanging above a large crowd. That image played to the nominee’s complaint about “Comrade Kamala” and allegations she was dangerously radical and far outside the political mainstream.
This narrative has also been pursued by businessman Elon Musk, who posted a fake image of Harris dressed in a communist-style military uniform. The caption on Musk’s post, which was made on his social media platform X, reads, “Kamala vows to be a communist dictator on day one. Can you believe she wears that outfit!?”
The circulation of fake images has not been limited to only depictions of the candidates. In a Truth Social post, Trump included a collection of images, many of which appear to be fake, that depict fans of Taylor Swift sporting “Swifties for Trump” shirts. Another fake image shows Swift dressed as Uncle Sam and includes text that reads, “Taylor wants you to vote for Donald Trump.” As the caption for his post, Trump wrote, “I accept!” implying that he accepted an endorsement from Taylor Swift.
We should not be surprised at the proliferation of so many fake images as this growing practice is documented in a new Brookings Press book, “Lies That Kill: A Citizen’s Guide to Disinformation.” Disinformation is a tough challenge because so many people have financial and political incentives to create and disseminate disinformation. Digital sites can make money through premium subscriptions, advertising, and merchandising sales. Tech tools make it easy to devise fake pictures and videos. The toxic political environment makes disinformation believable to many people who want to assign terrible motives to the opposition and accept the worst views about it. It’s like a chicken and egg game; the toxic political environment makes people willing to believe disinformation and the disinformation helps perpetuate the toxic political environment.
Beyond their own false narratives, fake images open an additional avenue for disinformation. With the proliferation of these images, politicians can falsely claim with perhaps greater apparent legitimacy that images painting them in a negative light (or their opponent in a positive light) are fake. This was seen when Trump falsely claimed that a picture of a large crowd at a Harris rally in Detroit was created using artificial intelligence, arguing that the sizable crowd “didn’t exist.”  
In order to safeguard democracy, we need to take several actions to protect people from false narratives. We should demonetize disinformation so that making lots of money off of it is more difficult. That can happen by giving advertisers more transparency and control over their ad placements so their advertisements don’t unwittingly finance known disinformation sites.
Social media platforms need to get more serious about content moderation. Most of the leading sites have terms of service agreements that preclude use of their platform to incite violence, promote hate speech, or engage in fraud. Companies that reduced their human safety staffs need to hire people whose jobs are to enforce the very standards firms claim to uphold.
Finally, voters need to exercise common sense in evaluating information from partisan or foreign sources. If something seems far-fetched, it probably is, and people should act accordingly. Just as consumers have grown more skeptical about email phishing efforts, consumer fraud, or Nigerian residents offering “quick rich” schemes, voters need to consider the source of information and weed out the pictures, videos, and narratives that are too outlandish to be true. Only in those ways can people protect themselves and help the country safeguard its voting processes in the face of nefarious actions from foreign and domestic sources."
115,What Benny Gantz’s resignation means for Israeli policy and politics,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-benny-gantzs-resignation-means-for-israeli-policy-and-politics/,Natan Sachs,"June 14, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"On Sunday, June 9, Israeli minister Benny Gantz, a member of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s war cabinet and Netanyahu’s main putative challenger for the position of prime minister, resigned from the government along with his fellow party member Gadi Eisenkot. The resignation comes at an awkward time for the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden, which has been making a significant effort to promote a cease-fire and hostage release deal, proposed by Israel, outlined by Biden in a speech on May 31, and adopted by the U.N. Security Council as Resolution 2735. Gantz and Eisenkot, major proponents of such a deal within the Israel war cabinet, are now out of decisionmaking circles. Should Hamas’s leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, accept the deal, which he has not so far, Netanyahu would now have heightened political incentive to balk at his own proposal. But the resignation may also serve to catalyze political changes in Israel that may hasten a change of leadership, something the Biden administration would welcome. While there is no guarantee that Gantz’s resignation will bring Israel’s elections any closer, it was a necessary step for any major political change.
The Israeli war cabinet is formed
As the details and magnitude of the October 7 terrorist attack became clear, there were immediate calls in Israel for a national emergency government that would include centrist opposition leaders alongside Netanyahu. Israelis shared a sense of historic crisis and were prepared for a major war. The official leader of the opposition, Yair Lapid, offered to join the cabinet, but he demanded that Netanyahu exclude Betzalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, two far-right ministers, from his security cabinet. Netanyahu refused, with the rationale that after the emergency government eventually dissolved, he would have lost his base. It was an early sign that politics would continue to play a substantial role in the prime minister’s decisions, even in the depths of the crisis.
Gantz, the other major opposition leader, joined the cabinet nonetheless, satisfied instead by the creation of a “mini” war cabinet that excluded the two far-right ministers from the management of the war.
In the Israeli system, the prime minister is not the commander in chief of the military. Rather, the cabinet serves in that role, as a committee, with most powers bestowed on a smaller security cabinet (formally, the “ministerial committee for national security affairs”) of which Smotrich and Ben-Gvir are members. Netanyahu and Gantz thus formed an ad-hoc forum, the mini-war cabinet, with three official members: Netanyahu, Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant of Netanyahu’s own Likud party, and Gantz. They were joined by three observers, Eisenkot; Ron Dermer, Netanyahu’s confidante and former ambassador to the United States; and Aryeh Deri, the most veteran minister and leader of the Shas party. Notably absent were the far-right ministers.
Resignations and consequences
Gantz and Eisenkot joined the emergency cabinet on a temporary basis, for the duration of the war’s initial phases, and with the public expectation that they might resign by the end of 2023 or early 2024. Months past that, their resignations now have implications for Israeli policy and politics.
By May, as tensions with the Biden administration over Israel’s Gaza strategy had grown, Gallant publicly called out Netanyahu and criticized the latter’s lack of strategy for what Gaza might look like after Hamas. Without defined strategic goals, no operational or tactical objectives could succeed. Gallant demanded that Netanyahu state that he does not plan for a return to Israeli occupation, as existed before the Oslo II Accords of 1994. This dramatic challenge to Netanyahu also created an opening for Gantz.
In May, Gantz finally signaled his intent to resign. He laid out conditions for his staying in the government and set an ultimatum that he would leave if they were not met, which Netanyahu rebuffed the same day. In policy terms, his most notable demand echoed Gallant, demanding that Netanyahu elucidate the beginning of a strategy for the day after in Gaza.
Gantz, Gallant, and Eisenkot are all retired generals with a long, shared history in the military. Gantz is the former chief of staff of the military, a high-profile role that is more influential in Israel than the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is in the United States, for example. As the only lieutenant general in the Israeli military and the commander of everyone in uniform, the chief of staff commands a great deal of attention from a public who face, in theory, universal conscription. When Gantz was appointed to the top military post in 2011, he was, in fact, the second choice of the cabinet. Netanyahu, the prime minister at the time, and then-Defense Minister Ehud Barak had preferred Gallant, who was considered more hawkish on Iran, but was disqualified by a public committee due to ethical concerns. Eisenkot was appointed as Gantz’s deputy in 2013 and eventually succeeded him at the top military post. 
Now in government and civilian clothes, the former generals were at times allies in the war cabinet, despite representing different parties. Their demand for strategic thinking about the day after also reflected their desire to see some role, even if limited, for the secular, West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA) in Gaza, which Netanyahu has rejected. The centrist ministers’ departures weaken that prospect, possibly strengthening the hands of Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, who would prefer to see the collapse of the PA altogether.
Elections are not imminent … probably
The resignations also had political motivations. Gantz has led Netanyahu in the polls ever since October 7, but his lead has narrowed significantly. If elections were held today, polls now suggest the possibility of an inconclusive election, though still with a clear advantage to the opposition. If these were the results of the next election, Gantz would need to cobble together a coalition reminiscent of the coalition headed by Lapid and Naftali Bennett, an act of political acrobatics that only held together for slightly over a year.
Elections are not scheduled for over two years, however. Even with Gantz’s resignation, Netanyahu’s original coalition, which consists of 64 out of 120 members of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, still holds a clear majority. It could fracture in different scenarios, but none of them is very likely in the short term.
First, with Gantz’s and Eisenkot’s resignations, centrist Likud members, such as Gallant, may opt to defect and try to replace Netanyahu. This would be a very risky move for them politically, but it may become more likely if demonstrations against the government, already growing, return to the large scale that Israel had seen before October 6. Gantz’s presence in the government, and especially the war’s continuation, made the environment less conducive to such public pressure until now.
Netanyahu’s far-right partners may also bring about his downfall if he veers to the center. In particular, they have already warned that should Hamas accept the cease-fire and Netanyahu move forward with the deal (a “surrender,” as Smotrich termed it), they would topple the government. This, of course, makes such a scenario less likely.
Finally, there is a small chance that Netanyahu’s Haredi partners, who are the most conservative religiously but not the most hawkish in terms of national security, might destabilize his coalition. Haredi men are exempt from military service, due to political maneuvering, a highly emotive grievance for the majority of Jewish Israelis who do serve, especially in a time of war and bereavement. With the Supreme Court now demanding a legislative basis for the exemption, Netanyahu’s coalition is struggling to put one in place. Seeing a political opening, Gantz made conscription, in some form, one of his central demands of Netanyahu. Should such a legal standing not be found, the Haredim may follow through on their threats to resign, though they are unlikely to get a better deal with another prime minister later, and so have incentives to remain.
One final option remains: Netanyahu could call for elections himself if he found an opportune moment or excuse. Netanyahu has identified his opposition to a Palestinian state as a winning ticket in a population traumatized by October 7 and loath to take any security risks in negotiations with Palestinians. Netanyahu would hope to portray himself as the one man able to withstand international pressure on Palestinian sovereignty. He will undoubtedly hope to return to the theme of his recent election campaigns, portraying himself as being “in a league of his own” in global diplomacy. One opportunity for a campaign image of Netanyahu on the global stage will come soon, currently scheduled for July 24, when he speaks before a joint session of Congress."
116,"China, the United States, and the future of a rules-based international order",https://www.brookings.edu/articles/china-the-united-states-and-the-future-of-a-rules-based-international-order/,Paul Gewirtz,"July 22, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",RESEARCH,"Few concepts in U.S. foreign policy are invoked more frequently than “the rules-based international order,” and few U.S. phrases are more contested by China. We accuse China of seeking to destroy or gravely undermine “the rules-based international order.” China accuses us and other Western countries of invoking the concept to demonize China and impose our hegemony.
In spite of the general deterioration of U.S.-China relations, we cannot postpone analyzing this conflict about “the rules-based international order” and getting a fuller understanding of the specifics of China’s challenge. We must consider what may sound like a far-fetched question: Is some bridging of the gap in this realm possible? This is essential to have any chance of salvaging an international order that is now gravely weakened and endangered.
The international system set up after World War II was a major effort to create “the foundation for global peace and prosperity.” But the ideal of organizing world affairs through international institutions and “rules” creating greater “international order” is now under great stress, being blatantly violated by wars and terrorism (most obviously, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine); international institutions such as the World Trade Organization undermined by greater economic nationalism; and insufficient new rules to address a variety of major new global challenges, such as climate change and artificial intelligence. We are at risk of the existing international order collapsing, becoming an empty shell, or being replaced by bipolar orders with a divided set of rules, or even more fragmentation.
Today’s global turmoil, of course, also reflects matters not directly involving the “rules-based international order”—most obviously, changes in the power dynamics and perceived interests of countries. But the international relations literature too frequently blurs the idea of “global order” as this general dynamic of international relations with the more specific concept of a “rules-based international order.” The latter domain involving “rules” is my subject here.
Salvaging this weakened international order will of course require extensive negotiation among a range of diverse countries. But the United States’ and China’s distinctive power elevates the importance of bilateral discussions. Since official U.S.-China diplomacy is almost certainly unable to tackle this vast project now, what I have written here is designed to be a starting point for experts outside of the two governments to begin clarifying specific disagreements between the United States and China about an “international order” based on “rules” and the possibilities of bridging them, as a preface for more official and multilateral negotiations. Since China is widely perceived as the greatest challenge to the rules-based international order, a central part of both that project and this paper is to better understand the elements of China’s challenge.
Understanding international law
At the outset, a few basic matters need to be clarified. First, as Iain Johnston has persuasively demonstrated, “there is no single international order”; there are multiple international orders. There are international institutions and rules in a variety of different fields—the United Nations and the U.N. Charter provide a general foundation, but many other international institutions and rules address fields like arms control, international trade and finance, human rights, development, and the environment. It is possible that the international order in some of these fields might collapse but endures in other fields. In addition, there are a variety of multilateral but not global institutions that coordinate or regulate members’ conduct, providing limited and often regional “rule-based order,” such as the European Union, BRICS, the G7, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and OPEC. These can contribute to “global order,” and often do. But they certainly can also create conflicts among nations. I focus here on international institutions and international law that have global applications or close to global applications.
Second, we should not romanticize the post-World War II international order. It has failed to prevent many kinetic wars, the Cold War, economic crises, and human rights disasters. Even after the Cold War ended and the United States became the “hegemonic” global leader, the international system hardly stopped crises from emerging throughout the world. The symbol of the United Nations is extraordinary and its structures force constant peaceful interactions between governments of countries around the world—but its powers are limited. “International law” is a complex concept and reality. The U.N. Charter is viewed as “international law” binding on all U.N. members. However, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not itself legally binding. Most “international law” derives from separately negotiated treaties and includes “customary” norms. But to be bound by a treaty, even one usually labeled as an “international treaty,” a country must ratify it. Both the United States and China have refused to ratify some major treaties that are often referred to, wrongly, as international law that binds all countries. If a country hasn’t ratified a treaty, the country is not legally bound by it.
In addition, the “international law” contained in treaties—or, for that matter, the U.N. Charter itself (not to mention the content of “customary” norms)—must be interpreted. Treaties often contain general and vague language open to various different interpretations. Indeed, as any lawyer knows, even quite specific language in a legal document is often open to reasonable, differing interpretations. International treaties do not always provide for judicial-style tribunals like domestic courts that resolve disputes about the law’s meaning, or they may do so only with the parties’ consent, and they typically have no power to enforce their decisions—and tribunals have often been rejected and criticized. Countries may and do get away with ignoring and blatantly violating international law. In short, there are significant limits on the real-world force of current international rules and the “order” they create.
But none of this undermines the significance of getting as much agreement as possible on the importance of international rules and “international law,” on specific rules, on the meaning of the rules and laws, and on compliance with them. To do so, an essential step is to better understand and analyze China’s views and positions.
China wants substantial change to the international order, not elimination
In recent years, the United States has repeatedly called China’s actions a “challenge” and a “threat” to the current rules-based international order, and that China is a “major disruptor” with “both the power and the intent to change the system that we’re living in.”
China has responded by saying “the ‘rules-based international order’ … is just another version of power politics[,] … an attempt to impose … the house rules of few countries.” It has decried the “so-called ‘rules-based’ international order” as not truly representative of “universal values”; in China’s view, “the overwhelming majority of countries in the world would not recognize … that the rules made by a small number of people would serve as the basis for the international order.”
This certainly sounds like a radical assault on an international system of rules and laws that seeks to restrain fundamental wrongs in the world. But in fact, China has not advocated the overthrow or elimination of “a rules-based international order.” Chinese criticism of “the rules-based international order” is probably based on China’s opposition to various parts of the existing rules-based international order, and China’s desire to substantially revise various rules and interpretations of the rules and change some existing features of current international institutions. That may not be reassuring to many people, but it is about keeping a system that is “international,” not embracing a world without “rules,” and not about creating two different sets of rules guiding each side in a bipolar order.
China’s 2023 Foreign Relations Law summarizes some of Beijing’s general ideas about global governance that receive more elaborate and propaganda-like presentations in other Chinese documents. Article 19 of the law specifically states that:
“The People’s Republic of China upholds the international system with the United Nations at its core, the international order underpinned by international law, and the fundamental norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
“The People’s Republic of China stays true to the vision of global governance featuring extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefits. It participates in the development of international rules, promotes democracy in international relations, and works for economic globalization that is more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all.”
“International law” mostly involves binding rules—not just “extensive consultation.” So, embracing “international law” is to embrace a central dimension of a “rules-based international order.” In short, the discourse in China endorses sustaining an “international” order that involves rules and laws.
At the same time, as Article 18 indicates, “The People’s Republic of China … participates in the reform and development of the global governance system.” This reveals that China not only wants changes to the substance of international law but also to fully participate in the procedures by which international law is made and implemented.
China’s growing power will certainly give it greater influence in the evolution of the international order—and with some plausibility, China’s argument that its greater power (along with the voices of many countries in BRICS and the Global South) entitles it to seek changes to the rules is analogous to the way domestic laws are debated in a Western “democracy” when new domestic political groups become more powerful. Of course, this hardly means countries that become more powerful get to remake the rules. We should certainly insist that China is obligated to follow current rules unless or until they are changed, even if we silently understand that all great powers (including the United States) depart from the rules when powerful national interests are at stake. But China’s greater power to try to influence the shape of an enduring international order launches a new political dynamic that can go in various directions.
When the People’s Republic of China first joined the international system, few people recognized that China’s characteristics would make its wholesale assimilation to the established rules a dubious expectation: China’s population was the largest in the world; it is ruled by a strong Communist Party radically different from Western democracies; it has a long history and entrenched cultural differences from “the West”; it harbored lingering resentment of what it calls “the century of humiliation” in which Japan and Western countries repeatedly waged war against it; the Chinese Community Party was feeling growing pride as China’s extraordinary “rejuvenation” continued. Nevertheless, China has remarkably benefitted from the existing international order, continues to benefit from it, and wants substantial parts of it to persist. But it clearly wants significant changes. Like it or not, we must more clearly accept that China as well as countries in the developing world will have a greater role in trying to influence the future of the international order if we want to preserve an international order.
In fact, the United States does not oppose the idea of revising the current rules-based order, and has explicitly endorsed the general idea of “updating” and “revitaliz[ing]” the international order. As Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said, “We want not just to sustain the international order that made so much of that progress possible, but to modernize it, to make sure that it represents the interests, the values, the hopes of all nations, big and small, from every region.” However, he has explicitly called China “the most serious long-term challenge to the international order,” including a challenge to “the foundations of the [existing] international order,” and warned that “Beijing’s vision would move us away from the universal values that have sustained so much of the world’s progress over the past 75 years.”
To be sure, although China endorses sustaining an “international order” that involves rules and law, China is developing relationships with other countries and creating institutions that could compose a new “bloc” in an emerging bipolar order. And something similar might be said of the United States and its “allies and partners,” as it has prioritized the goal of acting collectively with them. A bipolar world and the creation of a strong bipolar set of rules and institutions are clearly possible. The United States and China can both be said to be “hedging”—i.e., preparing to deal with increasingly more international matters through a bipolar struggle between blocs, with a separate set of rules, or even a more fragmented and disordered world. But while we are not there yet, we haven’t made appropriately sustained efforts to avoid that.
The changes China wants to the international order
Considering China’s challenge to the existing rules-based international order is distinctively powerful and important, we need a much more specific understanding of China’s views—most importantly, what specific changes Beijing wants to make to the existing international rules and institutions. We need specifics so we can have concrete discussions with the Chinese about the possibility of constructively moving forward.
China has given us some specifics, but mostly generalities and attitudes. The most comprehensive and concrete document China has issued about global governance is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ (MFA) Proposal on the Reform and Development of Global Governance issued on September 13, 2023 (what I will hereafter call the Global Governance Proposal). This proposal explicitly “calls on the international community to … further develop and improve the governance system,” with China playing “an active part in the reform and development” of that system. Most importantly, this MFA document is based on three major “global initiatives” announced by President Xi Jinping himself—the Global Security Initiative, the Global Development Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative.1 These three “global initiatives” combine ideas about China’s general foreign policy and ideas about global governance specifically, and the two must be distinguished—but they also contain China’s most authoritative statements about the future of global governance.2
The Global Security Initiative includes a statement China now regularly makes, that we need to “firmly safeguard the international system with the U.N. at its core and the international order underpinned by international law.” Here Xi emphasizes the centrality of “sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries” as the core element of “common … security.” But he blurs this point by urging a shared commitment “to taking the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously,” and by calling on states to “build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture” (vaguely suggesting a need to review the current global “architecture”). The Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ subsequent Global Governance Proposal in fact uses Xi’s language when discussing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine: “The root cause of the crisis lies in the problem of security governance in Europe,” the parties must “accommodate each other’s legitimate security concerns,” and interested parties must “work to build a balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture.” Does this reflect a fundamental change in China’s long-standing embrace of “sovereignty and territorial integrity” as the most fundamental principle of the U.N. Charter and international law? Or are these statements an unprincipled exception explained by a unique geopolitical moment, or carefully drafted phrasing about past causation rather than justifying a new international principle? We don’t have an answer to that.
Xi’s Global Security Initiative speech also says in general terms, “We need to embrace a global governance philosophy that emphasizes extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits.” He opposes and predicts the failure of “unilateralism,” “practices of decoupling, supply disruption and maximum pressure,” “the wanton use of unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction,” and attempts to “stoke conflict and confrontation along ideological lines.” These are clearly criticisms of U.S. actions, but in none of these specific areas does he propose specific changes in existing rules or institutions. Will China push for changed international rules and institutions to constrain such behavior?
Xi’s speech on the Global Development Initiative stresses the need “to put development high on the global macro policy agenda” given that the world’s “call for equity and justice is growing stronger.” It contains many admirable and generally phrased economic development goals—but not specific changes in the rules making up the international order. A Global Development Initiative “Concept Paper” circulated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the same day does call for “enhanc[ing] the representation and voice of emerging markets and developing countries in global governance,” but provides no specifics about what that “enhancement” means concretely. The paper also emphasizes the need to “build an open world economy, and … an open and interconnected global development environment” allowing for “unimpeded trade”—in spite of China’s having one of the least “open” economies in the world.
The Global Development Initiative’s “Concept Paper” explicitly supports “enhanced” global governance in the “priority areas” of “climate change and green development.” The “Concept Paper” also underscores “the special development difficulties of developing countries” and the “importance” of “both development and environmental protection.” Regarding countries’ addressing climate change, the MFA Global Governance Proposal is the most explicit in calling “for the full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement” and “especially” insists on “the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.” A central issue going forward in the future of the international order is what will be the specific rules implementing this “principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.” The United States has recently affirmed its agreement with this principle, but negotiations on more specific approaches are ongoing.
Xi’s most recent global initiative, the 2023 Global Civilization Initiative, points to what may be China’s most fundamental challenge to the current rules-based international order. Although Xi purports to “advocate the common values of humanity” and the “common aspirations of all peoples,” he suggests how much of the existing rules-based international order governing human rights China seeks to change. The initiative calls first and foremost for “respect for the diversity of civilizations,” insisting that states “refrain from imposing their own values or models on others.” These principles indicate resistance to a universal human rights regime that binds states regardless of their “diversified cultures.”
The MFA Global Governance Proposal is significantly more specific in its section that builds on the Global Civilization Initiative. It emphasizes that China’s framing values are “the diversity of civilizations,” “sovereignty,” and not “to interfere in other countries’ internal affairs,” which seems to preclude binding “rules-based” international human rights, at least where countries have not agreed. It explicitly states there is “no one-size-fits-all model” of human rights. It uses the phrase “universality of human rights,” but only to emphasize the “need to combine the principle of universality of human rights and [different countries’] national conditions.” In one of its most radical phrases, the document states that “All countries’ independent choice of their own path of human rights development should be respected.” It continues: “Human rights issues should not be politicized or used as a tool, double standard should be rejected, and still less should human rights be used as an excuse to interfere in other countries’ internal affairs or encircle and contain other countries as they pursue development.” The proposal does not explicitly address the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (which the United States has ratified but China has not) or the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (which China has ratified and the United States has not), but its statement that “subsistence and development are the basic human rights of paramount importance” supports the latter covenant and ignores the former. (Indeed, in discussions of human rights in almost any setting, China emphasizes the “elimination of poverty” in China as one of the Chinese Communist Party’s greatest achievements.)
These documents suggest that much of China’s rhetoric about “the rules-based international order” should be understood as challenging the West’s interpretation of and efforts to enforce human rights standards. These are stated not only in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China has not ratified, but also such countries’ interpretations of the U.N. Charter and other legally binding documents that China has indeed agreed to and that Western countries interpret to create enforceable political and civil rights.
The MFA Global Governance Proposal’s discussion of the U.N. Human Rights Council (HRC) is particularly revealing. The Human Rights Council is the arena of the existing international order where China has repeatedly taken concrete actions that transparently reveal the changes China wants in the existing order as well as the effect it is already having. In the Human Rights Council, China has insisted on “mutually beneficial cooperation” and “constructive dialogue” and rejected country-specific name-and-shame resolutions; has “block[ed] any official resolution condemning” China’s own alleged violations of human rights; and has tried to marginalize civil society actors and make the council’s human rights discourse and debates the exclusive prerogative of states. In October 2022, for example, China secured a narrow victory in a HRC vote defeating a draft resolution to debate the findings of a report on Xinjiang by the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights which documented evidence that China may have committed crimes against humanity.3 This all seems to suggest that international human rights are not binding “rules,” in spite of China’s explicit embrace of “international law.”
The MFA Global Governance Proposal concludes with a section entitled “Strengthening the core role of the U.N. and advancing the reform of the global governance system.” The theme that runs through this section is increasing not only China’s role but also the “representation and voice of developing countries,” including the “equitable reform of the Security Council” and “making special arrangements to meet Africa’s aspiration as a priority.” China also aims to “improve global economic governance” by “increasing the representation and voice of developing countries” at institutions such as the G20, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and World Bank, and boosting these entities’ “capacity and efficiency.” But no specific changes are proposed.
Significantly, less than a month before the MFA issued its Global Governance Proposal, the leaders of the BRICS bloc—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—held a summit in South Africa and issued a summit declaration that contained very similar ideas. Perhaps even more significantly, five new countries joined BRICS: Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. China’s efforts to expand and strengthen BRICS must be seen as building a substantial group of countries at odds with features of the current global order. They are countries that can be a powerful political force in trying to “reform” the international order, and also countries that are potentially a foundation for an institutional bipolar global order.
The BRICS summit declaration emphasizes “a more representative, fairer international order”—including many policies China has stated separately:
“The central role of the United Nations.”
“Upholding international law, including the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.”
“Greater representation of emerging markets and developing countries, in international organizations.”
“Comprehensive reform of the UN, including its Security Council … to increase the representation of developing countries.”
Criticism of “the use of unilateral coercive measures, which are incompatible with the principles of the Charter of the UN and produce negative effects notably in the developing world.”
“Reform of the Bretton Woods institutions, including a greater role for emerging markets and developing countries” such as “increases in [IMF] quota shares.”
“Cooperat[ion] in promoting and protecting human rights,” with “the right to development” given “the same emphasis” as other human rights, and promoting human rights in a “non-selective” way “without double standards.”
“Support for the … rules-based multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its core, with special and differential treatment for developing countries,” in addition to “necessary WTO reform” and the “restoration of . . . [the] two-tier binding WTO dispute settlement system.”
Addressing “trade restrictive measures which are inconsistent with WTO rules, including unilateral illegal measures such as sanctions.”
In short, the BRICS summit declaration asserts a mixture of support for the existing international order, calls for changes of some important elements stated at a quite high level of generality, and criticism of unnamed countries such as the United States for violating current rules and using double standards.
BRICS demonstrates China’s effort to garner support for revising the existing international order. By building a broader bloc of countries that agree on the need for substantial changes, China intends for BRICS, acting alongside many friendly Global South countries, to create a new political dynamic that will either seek change within the existing rules-based international order or potentially create a new bipolar order if some or all of the existing international order collapses.
A path to strengthening the international order
From Chinese documents and actions like those just summarized, outside researchers might be able to put together a plausible list of changes in the existing rules-based international order that China wants. Human rights is the most obvious area, where China’s actions in Xinjiang and Hong Kong and repression of political dissidents have produced both widespread condemnation and stern Chinese objections. There is harsh disagreement about the U.N. Law of the Sea, particularly as it is applied in the South China Sea. Regarding international trade rules enforced by the WTO, China accuses the United States of pervasive violations, while claiming that China is steadily compliant. (In fact, the WTO has found both the United States and China guilty of numerous violations over the years. But President Donald Trump took more radical steps to block the WTO’s dispute resolution process, which are still in effect.) And in the security field, China accuses the United States of persistently using force in violation of international law while asserting its own greater and enduring adherence to the U.N. Charter’s norms of “sovereignty” and “territorial integrity”—although China’s statements about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine seem contrary to that claim.
But as a country leading the charge to revise the international order, China is obligated to be more explicit: What specific existing rules of international law does China oppose and want to change, and what specific changes does it want? What interpretations of international rules does China believe are wrong, such that either the interpretation must change or the law being “wrongly interpreted” must be amended to specifically state the meaning China advocates? What changes in the operations of international institutions does China want? Having a clearer and more detailed understanding of China’s proposals or demands is essential.
We are at an historic moment. After the Cold War, the Western model of free trade and open economies, greater democracy, and human rights became the foundation of the rules-based international order—an imperfect one and with frequent double standards, but a dominant liberal order clearly led by a confident United States in a “unipolar” world. But the world has changed since the end of the Cold War; the unipolar moment is gone.
The United States remains by far the most powerful country in the world, but it is plagued by political division and uncertainty, its global influence is in flux, and its enduring commitment to the international order doubted by many. At the same time, China’s rise, Russia’s violence, and what Fareed Zakaria calls the “rise of the rest” are not only transforming geopolitics and economics but are explicitly challenging the character of international order in significant ways. After a unique and short period of modern history, we are no longer living in a unipolar world. The present rules-based international order is greatly weakening. Changes to it appear essential since a more divided, paralyzed, or even collapsed international system will be a world far weaker in its ability to address the massive and genuinely existential challenges the planet faces.
The United States should clarify what changes it wants to make to the existing rules-based international order to improve and strengthen it. But Washington also needs to know what changes other countries want and consider what changes it might accept. This paper emphasizes the importance of knowing the specific changes China wants because it is the most powerful and explicit challenger to the existing order. Many of the proposed changes will surely involve compromises the United States does not want to make. Nevertheless, some compromises seem acceptable if on balance a revised but rules-based international order would be preferable to a disintegrated or collapsed one.
But where will the United States and others refuse to compromise because they view the matter as an uncompromisable fundamental, even if that decision results in the collapse of a workable international order? As indicated above, Blinken has said that “Beijing’s vision would move us away from the universal values that have sustained so much of the world’s progress over the past 75 years.” Does this imply that the human rights arena may be part of the non-negotiable “foundation of the international order”?
It is impossible to know where the international system is headed, but only a process of negotiations can allow it to regain some strength. That process will eventually need to be multilateral, but it could begin with bilateral discussions between China—the de facto leader of the challengers—and the United States—the post-Cold War leader of the international order. The goal for the United States should be to learn what specific changes in the international order China wants and put on the table the specific changes we want, discussing and debating those ideas as a step in the far larger process that must eventually take place.
Given the current hostility in U.S.-China relations and the two countries’ minimal diplomatic exchanges, it seems difficult to imagine making progress on these extremely broad issues any time soon. Yet sustained “Track 2” dialogues among scholars and former government officials from both countries could be a good place to start discussions about the future of the international order. These conversations could take many forms and be more specific than the general exchanges about the “global order” that occur at various conferences and dialogues, but discussing and clarifying what China wants to see in a revised rules-based international order seems like the most valuable way to begin, probably proceeding sector by sector (trade, human rights, the U.N.’s institutional structure, etc.).
In negotiating to salvage a weakening and endangered international order, our persuasiveness will depend upon our power, our tenacity, our diplomatic skills, and our own fidelity to the rules-based international order we seek to preserve. Most importantly, it will require a driving belief in the importance of the goal—and not only by the United States, but by most other countries on our planet, who separately and together recognize the dangers we are facing, our differences yet our interdependence, our smallness in the universe but the infiniteness of human existence, and the capacity of human agency to make a difference."
117,Are convention delegates bound to their presidential candidate?,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/are-convention-delegates-bound-to-their-presidential-candidate/,Elaine Kamarck,"July 11, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"This question would not even be asked were it not for President Biden’s weak performance in his recent debate with Donald Trump—a performance that has called into doubt his ability run and to govern. The question arises against the backdrop of recent American history where delegates have been extras in the convention television show produced for prime time. They cheer on cue, wear colorful patriotic regalia, and offer glowing reviews of their standard-bearers to reporters desperate for a little bit of hard news. Because the victor at most modern conventions has been a foregone conclusion, the notion of delegates as the final decision-makers in a long nomination process has been lost—but, under certain circumstances, perhaps this one, they may still have the final word.
Here’s a bit of history.
Between 1831 and 1972, presidential candidates were nominated in conventions composed of elected officials and party leaders. Primaries were an invention of the Progressive Era, but presidential primaries were few and far between—averaging, between 1932 and 1968, about 16 a year and, moreover, most of those primaries were non-binding, meaning they were “beauty contests” only and had little to do with the preferences of convention delegates.1 In other words, they were irrelevant. For example, in 1952, Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver won 12 out of the 15 presidential primaries held that year, but his victories did not add up to delegates and he lost the nomination to Adlai Stevenson on the third ballot.
And then came the tumultuous 1968 convention which took place in the midst of protests against the war in Vietnam. Of the nine primaries that even listed the presidential candidates on the ballot, only three were in states where the primary results were binding when it came to delegate selection.2 Anti-war activists felt locked out of the party and were given, as a sort of consolation prize, a reform commission.
The reform movement in the Democratic Party that followed did two things, which were to radically change the nomination system—it required delegates to “fairly reflect” the presidential preferences of the voters that chose them—and it began the movement away from state conventions which selected delegates and toward primaries. Today, in both political parties, most states have a presidential primary, and delegates are selected to reflect the results.3
Implicit in the move to binding primaries (which happened in both parties) was the assumption that delegates would not be free agents—they would vote according to the results of the primary in their district or in their state. In other words, they would be “bound” to their candidate. In the modern era, this assumption has only come under serious attack twice—once in the in Democratic Party and once in the Republican Party.
In 1980, the Democratic President Jimmy Carter faced a very difficult re-election. He had presided over record high inflation and unemployment—a situation economists  had thought impossible until then. The Iranian hostage crisis and the military’s failed attempt to rescue them was a major humiliation and he was running far behind the Republican nominee Ronald Reagan. His political weakness led Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy to run against him in the primaries. And even though Carter racked up a substantial delegate lead early on, Kennedy began to win some later primaries and decided to take the fight all the way to the convention.
That’s where Kennedy came up against what came to be known as “the robot rule”—Rule 11(H). It said that all delegates to the convention were bound “to vote for the presidential candidate whom they were elected to support for at least the first convention ballot, unless released in writing by the presidential candidate.”4 Furthermore the rule contained an enforcement mechanism—delegates who tried to vote for someone other than the person they were elected to represent “may be replaced with an alternate of the same presidential preference by the presidential candidate…”5 To take the nomination away from President Carter, Kennedy had to convince enough delegates to change this rule. The battle was fought over the summer of 1980. In the end, very few Carter delegates defected and voted against the rule, allowing Carter to clinch the nomination.
In 2016, the Republican Convention went through their own version of the “robot rule” fight. Donald Trump had won the most delegates by running up pluralities in a fractured field of candidates. As the convention opened, it became clear that many important Republicans had serious doubts about Trump and were skipping the convention. Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, an anti-Trump Republican, told people he wouldn’t be there because he had to “mow his lawn.”6
As in 1980, those who showed up to attempt to deny Trump the nomination centered their strategy around a rule. This one (Rule 16) read “If any delegate…demonstrates support under Rule 40 for any person other than the candidate to whom he or she is bound, such support shall not be recognized.”7 What this meant in practice was the secretary of the convention could ignore the votes of the actual delegates on the floor and simply record the delegate preferences as they had emerged in the primaries—Robot Redux—if you will. Republican delegate Kendal Unruh of Colorado, one of the leaders of the Stop Trump movement, proposed that the rule be amended to include a conscience clause that would allow delegates to vote against Trump on the first ballot. Other activists formed a group called “Delegates Unbound,” and Curly Haugland, a national committeeman from North Dakota, argued in a book called “Unbound: The Conscience of a Republican Delegate,” that delegates should be free agents.8 Ultimately, the attempt to change the rule failed and Trump’s nomination moved ahead to victory.
In the eight years since the 2016 convention, Trump’s control over the Republican Party has solidified, and a challenge, including a fight over the role of the delegate, is unlikely. Not so for the Democrats, however. Following their contentious 1980 convention, the robot rule was quietly buried and replaced with the following—Rule 13 (J):
“Delegates elected to the national convention pledged to a presidential candidate shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.” [Italics are mine.]
There is no definition, nor is there any history about what constitutes “in all good conscience.” Few, if any, delegates to recent conventions have ever sought to test it. But if worries about President Biden’s ability to run and to serve continue to grow, along with fears of handing the presidency over to Donald Trump, some delegates may find themselves tempted to vote for someone else. It would not be surprising if this rule and the decades-long debate over the role of the delegate becomes relevant again."
118,Could the United States and China really go to war? Who would win?,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/could-the-united-states-and-china-really-go-to-war-who-would-win/,Michael E. O’Hanlon,"August 15, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Here’s something most Americans may be surprised to hear: military strategists in the United States consider China the nation’s main military worry—with the distinct possibility of a major U.S.-China war in the years to come. That is a terrifying prospect. The two countries are the world’s top two economic and military powers, both armed with nuclear weapons, each contributing 15% to 20% to world gross domestic product, and each dependent on the other for its prosperity given the depth and breadth of their economic relationships. Were they to go to war, however, global prosperity might soon become the least of our concerns; World War III could not be ruled out, and the survival of the human race might even be on the line.
A quick word of partial reassurance: I think that American military strategists tend to be, on average, slightly too hawkish on China, a country that some are calling part of a “new axis of evil” that also includes Russia, North Korea, and Iran. I might agree that the latter three nations, or at least their current leaderships, should be viewed as fundamentally malevolent and dangerous. But China is a more complex case, having brought hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in recent decades, having done much for economic growth around the world in general, and showing a certain aversion to military risk (it has not gone to war since 1979, though it has skirmished against India and the Philippines in recent times). Perhaps military strategists are seeing things too darkly, even as they rightly sound the alarm on some of China’s behaviors as well as its growing capacities and the ensuing risks to American interests. This backgrounder sketches out three different ways in which war pitting the People’s Republic of China against the United States (and some number of its allies) might break out1:
Over disputed islets and waters in the Western Pacific.
With a Chinese attempt to invade and conquer Taiwan, a polity of 23 million people that Beijing considers a renegade province, followed by a U.S. decision to come to Taiwan’s aid.
With a more limited use of Chinese force against Taiwan, most likely involving some type of blockade of the island in an attempt to strangle and coerce it into capitulation and reunification.
I find the first scenario the most likely to erupt, but the least likely to lead to all-out war. The last scenario causes me the greatest angst, based on a combined sense of its likelihood together with its potential for escalation both in the likely geographic zone of conflict and the potential use of nuclear weapons.
Limited war in the Pacific: The South China Sea
One set of scenarios has become all too plausible in recent years: a skirmish between the Philippines and China as they pursue competing claims to certain islands, rocks, and other generally inconsequential features in the South China Sea. The problem is that ownership of even rather small islands can provide land for military bases, while also conferring large territorial seas and exclusive economic zones to the country able to establish possession. On top of that, China seems to want to control ship movements throughout the entire South China Sea, or at least maintain the right to veto those it doesn’t like (such as those involving American aircraft carriers). A land formation called the Second Thomas Shoal is the most acute problem now; Manila (the capital of the Philippines) deliberately stranded an old ship on the shoal 25 years ago to assert its claim and keeps military personnel there all the time. In 2016, an Arbitral Tribunal constituted under the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea ruled in the Philippines’ favor given the proximity of inhabited Filipino islands to the shoal (meaning that the shoal is technically within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone). But Beijing rejects that argument. The United States has not ratified the convention upon which the tribunal based its decision, though it tends to accept its logic.
China has sometimes tried to impede the resupply of the Philippines’ position. Earlier this year when it did so, two ships collided, and a Filipino sailor lost his thumb. Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. had earlier stated that were a Filipino to lose his or her life in such a future showdown, that could be seen as an act of war. The problem would be significant enough if it involved only China and another regional country (there are others in the region besides the Philippines mired in disputes with China over the ownership of various islands). But because the United States has a security treaty with the Philippines, it could feel obliged to intercede in defense of its ally in the event of an escalating crisis in the future, though the exact threshold of violence that would lead to American intervention has not been specified, nor of course has the nature or scale of any such hypothetical intervention.
The United States, in the event of worsening tensions, would probably have only a few options:
Accompany a future Filipino resupply ship to the shoal and hope that China would choose not to press the issue.
Shoot back at any Chinese ship that shot at Filipino or American vessels.
Place its own personnel, at Filipino invitation, on the shoal and make it clear it will not only resupply them but defend them.
Choose a non-military punishment of China, most likely in the economic realm.
Fortunately, none of these options seem likely to lead to all-out war, since it would be the height of irrationality and irresponsibility to let such a skirmish blow up into a major confrontation. Unfortunately, however, once the shooting starts and people start dying, it is hard to rule out worrisome escalatory dynamics. Most wars in human history are not accidental, but sometimes big wars do get sparked by small events, as with the assassination of the archduke of Austria-Hungary in Bosnia in June 1914, leading to World War I that August.
An attempted Chinese invasion of Taiwan
Might China, tired of waiting for reunification since 1949 (when the Communist Party won China’s civil war, and the losing Nationalists fled to Taiwan) invade the island to force its absorption into the mainland? Once done, it would be very hard to undo, to say the least (though the United States might support resistance forces in Taiwan even if China managed to get its military ashore in an attempt to control the island).
It would also be extremely dangerous for the region and the world because of the risk that the United States would respond militarily. The United States no longer has any treaty obligation to come to Taiwan’s defense, as it did before Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon began the great opening to China in the 1970s. But the United States has a law known as the (1979) Taiwan Relations Act declaring that it might well do so if a Chinese attack against Taiwan occurred in an unprovoked manner. The United States has historical bonds with Taiwan, having backed the Nationalists during the civil war and then during the Cold War, and since the Eisenhower administration, Washington has threatened to use force to defend Taiwan. (In earlier eras, American maritime and air supremacy over China’s military was more lopsided than is the case today, making the task easier.) The United States has economic reasons to defend Taiwan, given that most of the world’s best semiconductor chips are made on the island. And it has strategic reasons: Taiwan’s fall could signal a China bent on regional aggression and expansionism—whatever Beijing might say now about its aims being limited to what it defines as national reunification—as well as a United States no longer as committed to the defense of friends and allies as it was once perceived to be. For these reasons, on as many as six occasions when asked, President Joe Biden has indicated an inclination to help defend Taiwan if China were to attack it (Biden gave no indication, however, about whether he would ask Congress for authorization).
The good news about deterring this war is that, for China, it would be a huge roll of the dice—and I do not detect a recklessness or acceptance of high risk in the leadership of today’s People’s Republic of China (PRC). There are, of course, different views about the nature of the China threat today, but few really argue that China would fail to carefully consider the costs and risks of any major military operation. President Xi Jinping is nationalist, assertive, and autocratic, but there is little to suggest he shares his friend Vladimir Putin’s proclivity to use force for high-risk ventures. And this one would be very risky, since amphibious assault has become even harder than during World War II, given the proliferation of sensors that can detect big troop ships and many types of precision missiles as well as torpedoes (and drones) that can strike them. With some luck, Taiwan might itself be able to fend off the attack; with prompt American military aid, it would have a very good chance.
The bad news about this scenario, however, is that the United States still largely relies on large, fixed airfields (notably on Okinawa, Japan) and big ships (notably, aircraft carriers) to provide much of the firepower that would be used to counter such an attack. It also has fragile civilian infrastructure in the United States (ports, airfields, electricity grids, fuel distribution networks) that it would need to deploy, resupply, and control many of these military forces. These may all be vulnerable to Chinese preemption. Yes, the United States has attack submarines and long-range stealth bombers too, but China may conclude that America does not have enough. The PRC might also miscalculate America’s ultimate willingness to risk World War III over what, in Beijing’s eyes, may seem a relatively minor interest to the faraway United States. In other words, Beijing might, rightly or wrongly, construct a theory of relatively rapid victory that it comes to place great stock in.
When war games are carried out to gauge how these scenarios might play out—and who might win—different games produce different results, even about the ultimate victor. Some have projected that the United States would ultimately succeed in helping Taiwan protect itself, though possibly losing many aircraft, ships, and tens of thousands of personnel in the effort. Other simulations have wound up predicting Chinese victories.
My own views can be condensed into three main points:
This is an extremely risky scenario for China.
We can make it even riskier with the right kinds of additional military investments by Taiwan and the United States—for example, unmanned or tilt-rotor aircraft operating off Okinawa’s roads that do not require runways for launch and that can deploy sensors and shooters to the Taiwan Strait in the event of an invasion attempt, and that in some cases are numerous and inexpensive enough to be expendable without jeopardizing America’s future military posture. Unmanned underwater vessels stationed permanently in the Western Pacific might play similar roles.
If heaven forbid the scenario takes place anyway, even if China loses at first, we are still in trouble. There is little reason to think the war will simply then end. Beijing might then consider nuclear threats or retaliation, against Taiwan and/or the United States. It might also simply settle back into what I think is its best military and strategic option in the first place: a blockade, perhaps combined with cyberattacks and other forms of harassment or limited violence. The blockade, and related operations as well as American counters, might expand geographically to the Indian Ocean, the Persian Gulf, and beyond. It is to that latter type of scenario that I now turn.
China’s best option: Blockade
Rather than undertake a cosmic roll of the dice and try to conquer Taiwan with an invasion, what if Beijing ratcheted up the kind of thing it has been doing of late—sending missiles near Taiwan when it senses that leaders in Taiwan or the United States are trying to promote Taiwan’s independence? For example, China fired a number of missiles into waters around Taiwan in August 2022 after then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi visited the island. That has created a “new normal” of heightened Chinese military activity near Taiwan; next time it chooses to escalate, China could aim closer to shore. Perhaps it could take out a ship or two anchored in a port in Taiwan or destroy some shipping cranes in the harbor. Perhaps it could send 20 to 40 submarines out to sea and threaten to sink any commercial ship going in or out of Taiwan, unless that ship first docks in mainland China and allows its cargo to be inspected. Baby food and medicine might be allowed into Taiwan; anything smacking of military utility, or even high-tech goods crucial to Taiwan’s economic relationships with the rest of the world, might not be.
Beijing’s goal with this kind of limited attack might be to target Taiwan’s economy more than its people or even its military—trying to coerce, through economic pain and threatened strangulation, while limiting any loss of life. Not only would the intensity of the operation be adjustable like a rheostat, but the operation could even be temporarily scaled back if and when too many American naval ships came to Taiwan’s assistance to set up a safe shipping channel and break the blockade. Even if the United States and many core allies coalesced around the idea of a strong response (as Western nations did when the Soviets carried out the blockade of Berlin in 1948-1949), Beijing might hope that many neutral countries would overlook the relatively limited amounts of violence associated with this kind of operation and not join the U.S. coalition.
I think this is the most credible scenario. It is also, I believe, very hard for the United States to counter. We can try to sink those Chinese submarines and shoot down those Chinese missiles, but the process will be slow, and we will take losses, too. I have attempted, through simple computations, to model how these scenarios might play out. Under certain plausible assumptions, I believe the United States plus Taiwan and probably Japan would win; under other equally plausible assumptions about the performance and survivability of missiles, missile defenses, surface ships, satellites, cyber systems, and other key assets, alas, I fear China could “win” in the sense of sinking enough of our fleet needed for the counterblockade operation that we would have to call off the effort.
Of course, whichever side loses round one may try again. The loser could, for example, rearm and then simply try again in a few years, or it could expand the conflict geographically, or it could even threaten the use of nuclear weapons (like Eisenhower did during the two Taiwan crises of the 1950s). There is little reason to think this scenario could be contained and little reason to think it would end soon—even if one side or the other did seem to win at first. China would be unlikely to give up in trying to seize an island it considers rightfully its own, or to accept defeat at the hands of a country it considers its main rival. The United States, with its tradition of military assertiveness and strong devotion since the 1940s to the defense of allies, would likely see the stakes in any such war not simply as the fate of 23 million living in Taiwan, but the fate of its entire system of alliances and partnerships.
The single best way that the United States can more effectively deter a Chinese blockade of Taiwan, I believe, is to strengthen what Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has been calling integrated deterrence, a term I also coined in a 2019 book. It means working with allies to ensure that they too send a strong message of willingness to resist any Chinese attack—not only with military responses but also with economic preparations that would make their nations more resilient in the event of a protracted economic war pitting the United States and its allies and partners against China.
It would, of course, really be much better not to fight any of these scenarios against China! The first is quite dangerous; the second and third are profoundly perilous. Deterrence is one part of the path forward for America, but so is a commitment to crisis management—and, on some issues, even to compromise. Beijing, Taipei, and Washington all have crucial roles to play in this effort, since the irreducible objective must be to prevent a war that might not prove controllable—and that could become the greatest tragedy in the history of the human race."
119,How would Trump and Biden handle US nuclear policy upon reelection?,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-would-trump-and-biden-handle-us-nuclear-policy-upon-reelection/,,,,,,
120,Why North Korea matters for the 2024 US election,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-north-korea-matters-for-the-2024-us-election/,"Andrew Yeo, Hanna Foreman","July 8, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",RESEARCH,"Executive summary
Although U.S.-China competition, Russia’s war in Ukraine, and conflict in the Middle East loom large as top foreign policy issues in the upcoming 2024 U.S. elections, presidential candidates Joe Biden and Donald Trump will need to address escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula and U.S.-North Korea relations. Since the collapse of the Hanoi Summit in February 2019, North Korea has adopted a more offensive nuclear doctrine, advanced its missile and satellite technology, improved its cyber capabilities, and strengthened political ties with Russia and China. However, the expected rematch between Biden and Trump in 2024 presents a stark contrast in how the two candidates might address North Korea and its nuclear program in a second term.
Both candidates want to project strength and confidence. However, when examining their records, the two leaders diverge in their respective approaches to North Korea. Trump prefers a top-down style, interacting with leaders one-on-one. Meanwhile, Biden coordinates closely with allies and partners, taking cues from the working-level in a bottom-up fashion.
Pyongyang’s unwillingness to relinquish its nuclear weapons limits the range of policies available to the United States but also forces the next administration to be flexible and disciplined when approaching the North Korea problem. As November approaches, both candidates should consider building a wider coalition of partners willing to monitor North Korea’s illicit activity and sanctions evasion; seek common ground with Beijing in reorienting Pyongyang to the negotiating table; and consistently advocate for North Korean human rights.
North Korea and the 2024 U.S. election
Three decades of U.S.-North Korea nuclear diplomacy have left U.S. officials skeptical of any nuclear deal with North Korea. Meanwhile, the North Korea conundrum has only worsened in the absence of diplomacy between Washington and Pyongyang since 2019. In addition to conducting 106 missile launches since 2022, North Korea’s partnerships with China and Russia have enabled Kim Jong Un’s regime to skirt U.N. sanctions, transfer and receive critical technologies, and provide opportunities to test North Korean weapons on the Ukrainian battlefield. The Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership signed during the June 2024 Kim-Putin summit further demonstrates North Korea’s intent to expand military-technical cooperation and undermine U.S. influence.
Although North Korean issues remain lower on the list of U.S. foreign policy priorities considering two wars and competition with China, the newfound Russia-North Korea alliance illustrates how the brewing crisis on the Korean Peninsula relates to wider geopolitical contestation. Trump may be more inclined to engage with Kim given their past rapport. However, high-stakes diplomacy with North Korea would be ill-advised if engagement is pursued at the cost of undermining regional alliance cohesion and deterrence. For Biden, the impasse in North Korean denuclearization may lead his administration to draw greater attention to linkages between North Korea and other adversaries, including Russia, China, and Iran. But doing so would not necessarily improve an already worsening security environment in Northeast Asia without some path to dialogue with North Korea.
On North Korea issues, the top priority for the next U.S. administration is halting, if not reversing, progress in the regime’s nuclear and weapons programs. An early task for the next U.S. administration is to rebuild a coalition of partners willing to monitor North Korea’s illicit activity, enforce a weakened sanctions regime, and counter North Korean cyberactivity following Russia’s veto of the resolution renewing the U.N. Panel of Experts’ mandate to investigate such activities. Although Republicans and Democrats remain critical of China, the next administration should also seek cooperation with Beijing to support peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, particularly in light of strengthened North Korea-Russia ties. Finally, Trump or Biden must consistently advocate for North Korean human rights, including enhancing North Koreans’ access to information. Although the Kim regime remains resilient for now, its legitimacy could be challenged down the road by disgruntled elites in the wake of internal or external challenges, particularly if Kim’s health deteriorates and succession plans for the fourth generation of Kim rule are unclear or contested.
A few points bear in mind as American voters consider how Trump and Biden might address a deteriorating security situation on the Korean Peninsula. First, Trump may raise the issue of North Korea on the campaign trail given his previous engagement with Kim during two high-profile summits in Singapore in June 2018 and Hanoi in February 2019, respectively. Despite the absence of a deal, Trump may tout his own ability to bring Kim to the diplomatic table and (misleadingly) criticize Biden for not only failing to hold a single dialogue with North Korea but also enabling the regime to dramatically ratchet up provocations on Biden’s watch.
Second, Biden can point to his administration’s ability to closely coordinate policy with U.S. allies to ensure that deterrence is maintained on the peninsula despite North Korea’s escalatory actions. Biden may also cast blame on Trump for naively and prematurely pursuing two high-level summits with Kim and weakening military readiness and deterrence on the Korean Peninsula.
Third, regardless of whether either candidate includes North Korea in their campaign talking points, Kim may insert himself into the conversation by escalating tensions prior to the U.S. elections if he believes such actions offer an advantage to Trump, his preferred candidate. In addition to his past rapport with Kim, Trump is more willing to break with diplomatic orthodoxy. By stirring up trouble, Pyongyang could help set the table for an incoming Trump administration to return to the negotiating table and reduce tensions in return for concessions sought by Kim (and previously suggested by Trump), such as the reduction of U.S. troops or the suspension of joint military exercises with South Korea, which in turn would create a rift in the U.S.-South Korea alliance.
Assessing Trump’s past approach to North Korea
As a candidate in 2016, Trump expressed an interest in meeting Kim to discuss North Korea’s nuclear program. While this was a major shift in U.S. thinking on North Korea, the desire for a new approach was not unwarranted at the time given the lack of progress from past efforts, including the Agreed Framework, the Six-Party Talks, and strategic patience.
However, North Korea conducted two nuclear tests in 2016 and continued to exacerbate tensions on the global stage as Trump entered the White House in 2017. This included the release of imprisoned American student Otto Warmbier in a comatose state, the murder of Kim’s half-brother Kim Jong Nam in Malaysia, the successful testing of the first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the U.S. mainland, a sixth nuclear test, and multiple short- and medium-range missile launches. Amid these human rights abuses, the administration spotlighted human rights in North Korea by inviting Warmbier’s parents and a North Korean defector during Trump’s first State of the Union Address. On the nuclear front, Trump threatened “fire and fury like the world has never seen,” while Pyongyang warned it was considering striking Guam. The use of bombastic language by both sides increased fears of a nuclear war but also forced rare unity in the United Nations Security Council when China and Russia supported tougher new sanctions on North Korea.
Meanwhile, South Korea elected President Moon Jae-in, a progressive, who advocated for unconditional engagement and dialogue with Pyongyang, a departure from a decade of hardline conservative policy toward North Korea. Throughout the last half of 2017, Moon’s diplomatic outreach attempts to North Korea were largely ignored. During his annual New Year’s address in 2018, Kim signaled an openness to dialogue, capping off a foray into global diplomacy first with Beijing and then Seoul. With inter-Korean relations steadily improving, Kim took diplomacy a step further by expressing a willingness to relinquish his nuclear weapons if Washington committed to a formal end to the Korean War and promised to not attack the North. Given Moon’s desire for continued inter-Korean engagement, Moon positioned himself to bring Trump and Kim to the negotiating table.
Officials in the Trump administration continued to advocate for close coordination with U.S. allies to prevent Pyongyang from dividing the U.S.-South Korea alliance. However, Trump was eager to negotiate directly with Kim. On June 12, 2018, Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader at the Singapore summit during which Pyongyang committed to the “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” without a detailed timeline and Washington pledged to “provide security guarantees.” Most notably, these guarantees included suspending joint military exercises with South Korea, which Trump claimed were provocative and a waste of money and time. This decision appeased North Korean hardliners but left some U.S. officials as well as Seoul and Tokyo in the lurch, bracing for future abrupt policy reversals and jeopardizing military readiness. Between South Korea and Japan, Seoul had the most to lose from this suspension as Trump officials “deliberately excluded” Moon amid concerns he was “too willing to make concessions to North Korea.”
In the aftermath of the Singapore summit, Trump was increasingly eager to make progress on North Korea before the 2018 midterm elections, but he believed that Moon was prioritizing unification and engagement over denuclearization. Progress on working-level negotiations continued to stall as North Korean officials threatened to remove denuclearization from the agenda. Amid the deadlock between U.S. and North Korean officials, Trump increased trade pressure on China to push Beijing to encourage Pyongyang to cooperate during negotiations.
In a last-ditch effort to salvage hopes for denuclearization, Trump and Kim met in Hanoi for a second summit hoping for a diplomatic breakthrough. According to then-National Security Advisor John Bolton, despite Trump’s desire to strike a deal, White House officials framed the second summit as “not make-or-break” and repeated the “if we walk, it’s okay” mantra to lower the stakes during briefings. Rather than settling for a bad deal, Trump abruptly walked away from the summit with no joint agreement, leaving the peninsula’s status quo intact.
An impromptu encounter between Kim and Trump on the North Korean side of the demilitarized zone in June 2019 suggested the possibility of resuming talks at a future date. Yet, Pyongyang resumed missile testing in the summer and fall of 2019 after a year of no missile launches in 2018, as shown in Figure 1."

The Democratic and Republican parties’ candidates for president, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, are advocating for very different policies regarding women’s reproductive rights, people of color’s voting rights, children’s right to be safe at school, and many other pressing issues that matter to Americans.
Who Americans elect in November will affect not only them and their rights but will also affect multitudes around the world. As with her domestic policy agenda, Vice President Harris’s vision for U.S. foreign policy presents a sharp contrast to the one former President Trump is offering the world, especially with respect to human rights. Three issue areas illustrate this difference: immigration, international law institutions, and Israel-Palestine.
The 2020 election and a change in U.S. foreign policy
When then-Senator Harris and former Vice President Joe Biden ran for office in 2020, they promised to restore U.S. leadership in the world. Many international affairs experts agreed that the United States was worse off than it had been four years earlier because of Trump’s foreign policy. Trump had withdrawn U.S. membership in multilateral agreements like the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal and snubbed international institutions such as NATO, the World Health Organization, and the World Trade Organization. These and other “America First” moves resulted in the United States being less respected around the world, less safe, and weaker economically.
Biden and Harris’s return to international cooperation—which included rejoining international agreements and reassuring allies of U.S. support—garnered high approvals from international affairs experts, the public, and world leaders in their first days in office and in the months and years following. Echoing leaders from around the globe, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen declared, “The United States is back.”
In addition to strengthening international ties, Biden and Harris pledged to “revitalize our national commitment to advancing human rights and democracy around the world”—a commitment that Trump did not share. Indeed, Trump’s government violated the human rights of many people across the world, including through discriminatory, and sometimes violent, travel, immigration, and asylum policies.
Immigration
Immigration is often considered a domestic policy issue, but it is also part of foreign policy, especially when political leaders like Trump frame immigrants as threats to national security. Immigration policy also impacts people’s human rights, which are protected by international and domestic law.
The Trump administration discriminated against people from Muslim-majority countries and African countries, banning travel from several; separated undocumented migrant children from their parents at the U.S. southern border as part of a “zero tolerance” policy; and failed to intervene as migrant women were forcibly sterilized in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers.
These policies violated, among others, the right to non-discrimination and equal protection, which is codified in international human rights agreements that the United States has ratified, including the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Article 26 of the treaty prohibits discrimination and requires countries to “guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.” The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights also upholds the human right to freedom of movement (Article 13) and the human right to seek and find asylum from persecution in other countries (Article 14).
The Biden-Harris White House ended Trump’s travel bans; created an interagency task force to reunify migrant families; ended family separations; and agreed to a settlement allowing reunified families to stay and work in the United States and receive social services while their asylum claims were processed. The administration also closed some ICE facilities where detainees had been abused.
If Trump wins in November, he is likely to revisit the policies that Biden reversed. Already, Trump has committed to bringing back and expanding the travel ban. Though the public opposed the travel ban (and the family separation policy), the public sees Biden, and thus Harris, as weak on immigration and border security issues compared to Trump.
Trump’s and Harris’s stances on immigration have different foundations. Trump appears to be more interested in addressing symptoms, as seen with his “Remain in Mexico” policy. Meanwhile, Harris is interested in addressing root causes, such as political instability, drug trafficking, gang violence, and a lack of economic opportunity in different countries around the world, including in Mexico and Central America—problems that, if addressed, would likely decrease the number of people who feel they must leave their home countries. For undocumented immigrants already in the United States, Harris has promoted an “earned pathway to citizenship,” but she has not said precisely what this would look like or entail.
International law institutions
In 2020, the Trump administration levied sanctions—a combination of asset freezes and travel restrictions—to punish and obstruct the work of officials at the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC is the world’s only international court that can hold individuals criminally accountable for atrocity crimes, including war crimes and crimes against humanity. It is a defining feature of the international system that builds on the legacy of the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials after World War II and the tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia after the Rwandan genocide and the Balkans conflict.
Trump’s sanctions came after the ICC’s chief prosecutor at the time, Fatou Bensouda, elevated probes in Afghanistan and Palestine from preliminary examinations to full investigations—investigations in which U.S. and Israeli personnel are respectively included, alongside the Taliban, Hamas, and other armed groups. The Afghanistan probe dates back to 2003, while the Palestine probe dates back to 2014. Because both Afghanistan and Palestine are court members, alleged atrocities committed on their territories are within ICC jurisdiction—regardless of the perpetrators’ nationalities. Nonetheless, Trump (and later Biden) rejected the court’s jurisdiction over U.S. and Israeli forces because the United States and Israel are not ICC members. Over the years, and especially in recent months, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has joined Trump’s and Biden’s condemnations of the court for what they perceive as a false moral equivalence between Israeli and Hamas actions.
While objecting to the court’s investigations in Afghanistan and Palestine, Biden rescinded Trump’s sanctions on ICC officials a few months into his term, in response to pressure from allies. Biden also decided to assist the court in its investigation into alleged Russian atrocities in Ukraine, though Russia, like the United States and Israel, is not an ICC member.
Similar to Trump, Biden has seemed to want it both ways—immunity for the United States and its friends and scrutiny for its foes. While broadly consistent with a decades-long practice of selective cooperation with and opposition to the ICC, this policy ran its course long ago. To lead the world, the United States must follow the rules it applies to others—and survey research suggests that the U.S. public recognizes this. Most Americans support the United States joining the ICC.
Harris has emphasized her commitment to the rule of law—the idea that laws should apply to everyone, equally. But it is not clear if she would apply rule of law principles on the world stage. It is very unlikely that as president she would accept ICC jurisdiction over Americans, discarding the playbook that Republican and Democratic presidents have used for more than 20 years. But Harris could accept ICC jurisdiction over Israel, partly depending on whether her party supports it. Congressional Democrats have been split on whether to support the ICC, whose current chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, has applied for arrest warrants for Hamas and Israeli leaders for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Congressional Republicans, by contrast, oppose the court’s probe into Israelis and they want to revisit sanctions.
In the spring, a bipartisan group of senators and House representatives passed an appropriations bill—which President Biden signed into law—that stipulated a hold on aid to Palestine if the Palestinian Authority cooperates with the ICC’s investigation as it relates to Israel. Attempting to impede an international court’s investigations in this way would seem contrary to the rule of law but it is not clear if Harris would veto a similar bill in the future. Especially when bundled with the broader U.S. federal budget, Harris might see vetoing congressional action against Palestine and the ICC as too costly.
A Harris presidency could, nonetheless, mean stronger action in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict—a human rights and foreign policy arena where Harris seems to differ from both Trump and Biden.
Israel-Palestine
The same year Biden rescinded the ICC sanctions, the administration ran for a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), a body the Trump administration had exited in 2018. The UNHRC is “an intergovernmental body within the United Nations system responsible for strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights around the globe and for addressing situations of human rights violations and making recommendations on them.” The United States won the bid and took up its seat on the council in 2022 for a three-year term that ends this year.
As a UNHRC member, the United States has supported important resolutions addressing human rights crises in Ukraine, Syria, Myanmar, South Sudan, Nicaragua, and many other countries. But the Biden-Harris administration’s record at the UNHRC is checkered. For instance, the administration has voted against resolutions that criticize and demand accountability for suspected illegal conduct by Israeli forces in Palestinian territory.
Similarly, at the U.N. Security Council, the United States has vetoed or abstained from resolutions calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war. Moreover, at the International Court of Justice, the U.N.’s judicial body, the United States has denied allegations that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians, even as the court itself said Israel has plausibly violated its obligations under the 1948 Genocide Convention.
Though broadly consistent with the decades-long U.S. policy to defend Israel (even when Washington and Jerusalem disagree with each other), these recent moves at the U.N. (and continued U.S. military aid to Israel) seem to ignore the U.S. public’s growing opposition to the war in Gaza. Since the October 7 terrorist attack, when Hamas fighters killed about 1,200 Israelis and took an estimated 250 hostages, Israeli forces have killed tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, where famine is now spreading.
While maintaining Israel’s right to self-defense, Harris has drawn attention to the suffering of Palestinians and applied pressure on Israeli officials, notably Netanyahu, to “finalize the [cease-fire] deal as soon as possible.” Some Israeli leaders have criticized her for this and accused her of putting the cease-fire talks in jeopardy, but Harris empathizes with Palestinians and Israelis (compared to Biden who seems more empathetic to Israelis) and she insists on acknowledging both sides’ pain.
It is noteworthy that it is Harris who suggested that Biden denounce Islamophobia, in addition to antisemitism, shortly after October 7. And it is Harris who connected what happens abroad with what happens at home, bringing up the crisis in Gaza in a speech commemorating the 59th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, when U.S. Civil Rights Movement activists were attacked by law enforcement on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. Senior administration officials have reportedly held Harris back, diluting if not muting her views. But she has continued to speak out.
For example, after Netanyahu’s visit to Washington in July, Harris said, “We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent.” Moreover, in her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, Harris advocated both for Israel’s security and “dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination” for Palestinians—all fundamental principles of human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Trump has distorted Harris’s position, however, claiming the vice president hates Israel (and Arabs). An avowedly staunch supporter of Israel, he views criticism of the country as anti-Jewish. In addition, his policy proposals have historically favored Israel at Palestinians’ expense. What’s more, Trump has advocated for crackdowns on pro-Palestinian protests in the United States, including the deportations of demonstrators.
Looking forward
Harris hasn’t yet said how exactly she would resolve the many foreign policy problems the United States faces, including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Though she opposes an arms embargo on Israel, she has not indicated if as president she would maintain all of Biden’s policies. Neither has she suggested what concessions Israel should make if and after hostages are repatriated and a cease-fire agreement is reached. U.S. presidents have long advocated for a two-state solution but to no avail. It is hard to predict how transformative a Harris presidency would be, for this part of the world and elsewhere. But it could mark the beginning of a change in Washington and U.S. human rights and foreign policy. In using the language of human rights, Harris has signaled to a greater degree than Trump that she would uphold human rights principles and institutions, at home and abroad."

125,An inflection point for the Houthis,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/an-inflection-point-for-the-houthis/,Allison Minor,"January 16, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Amid the growing promise of a Yemen peace process, on one hand, and the Houthi’s escalating use of force against international actors, on the other, the decisions the Houthis make in 2024 will represent a turning point for their relationship with the international community as well as Yemen’s trajectory.
The Houthis’ attacks on Red Sea shipping and confrontation with the United States provide them with significant short-term benefits: By presenting themselves as the defenders of Palestine, the Houthis have quelled growing domestic dissent over their poor governance and asserted themselves as a regional player.
The attacks have significant costs for Yemen and the Houthis, however. If they persist, they threaten to perpetuate a state of “no peace, no war” and isolate a country dependent on international support. While regional and international actors will seek to avoid a major re-escalation of hostilities in Yemen, the Houthis’ actions are eroding the prospects of international support for Yemen’s peace process and economic recovery. The consequences of this will be far greater than those of the targeted strikes against Houthi military assets.
The Houthis seem to be dismissing these consequences. Iran, which has provided years of military support and the expertise that helped enable the Houthis’ attacks, is itself largely immune to the consequences. This increases the risk that the Houthis or Iran may continue to use the latter’s attacks on international shipping to extract concessions even after the Israel-Gaza crisis ends.
Quiet progress in Yemen’s peace efforts
Nearly a decade of devastating conflict created the world’s largest humanitarian crisis and upended stability in the Arab Gulf as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates sought to reverse a Houthi takeover of most of northern Yemen. But there have been no major changes to the war’s frontlines since 2018.
Over the past decade, the Houthis have cemented their control over much of northern Yemen. Through peace efforts, they seek to formalize that role and gain access to Yemen’s oil and gas resources — control they failed to secure militarily. Unlike the Taliban in Afghanistan, the Houthis have not demonstrated the ability to seize the entire country by force. Hostility toward the Houthis is particularly strong in southern Yemen, which was an independent country prior to 1990 and which houses much of Yemen’s oil reserves and natural gas infrastructure.
The April 2022 truce between the Houthis, the internationally recognized Yemeni government, and the Saudi-led coalition supporting the government ushered in a new era of de-escalation in Yemen. The truce — mediated by the United Nations with strong U.S. and regional support — has saved thousands of lives and disrupted a dangerous spiral of regional escalation. For over a year, however, it was unclear if the truce provided a path to peace and recovery in Yemen. That changed last month, when the U.N. special envoy for Yemen announced that the Houthis and the Yemeni government were preparing to resume a political process. Exhaustive diplomacy finally secured support from the Houthis, a growing number of armed groups associated with the government, and major regional players for the basic contours of a peace process.
The Houthis’ miscalculation and the costs of isolation
It was not the U.N. announcement that featured in international headlines in December, however, but news of continued Houthi attacks on international shipping. At the time of writing, over 28 ships associated with over 55 countries — more than a quarter of all countries in the world — have been threatened by Houthi attacks. Several of the ships have no current affiliation with Israel.
The Houthis’ leaders erroneously believe they can secure international legitimacy while continuing to disregard basic tenets of international law. In doing so, the Houthis seem to be confusing the international community’s efforts to avoid re-escalation in Yemen with acceptance of their behavior.
In reality, the cost of continued Houthi attacks may be devastating isolation, as both international and regional partners withdraw much-needed diplomatic support, assistance, and economic cooperation.
The recent confrontation between the Houthis and the United States has significantly escalated the situation, but it is still possible to de-escalate. Doing so will require the Houthis to think beyond the short-term benefits of their attacks and choose their next steps carefully.
Yemen amid foreign dependency and domestic crisis
Yemen’s peace process is dependent on proactive international support. Intense engagement from the United States and other U.N. Security Council (UNSC) members, including corralling buy-in from a variety of regional players and Yemeni groups, was essential for Yemen’s peace efforts to advance over the past two years. Without it, that consensus is likely to falter, regional attention will wane, and Yemeni groups that are deeply unhappy with peace efforts may turn into spoilers. Even if the political process hobbles on, the UNSC would likely be unable to endorse a transitional government led by the Houthis if the group continues to actively disrupt freedom of navigation and attack civilians from dozens of U.N. member states.
Yemen is facing a dire economic and humanitarian crisis. Basic services have collapsed, leaving 21.6 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. A quarter of the population has no income because economic activity has crumbled. As a result of the political turmoil, southern Yemen suffers from rampant inflation while northern Yemen faces a major liquidity crisis. While the Houthis have long blamed Yemen’s humanitarian crisis solely on import restrictions imposed by the Yemeni government and Saudi-led coalition, the drivers of the crisis are much broader. Only a resolution of Yemen’s political turmoil and a full-scale, internationally-backed recovery effort can begin to reverse the suffering.
The U.N.-negotiated peace process roadmap reportedly includes short-term Saudi financing for public sector salaries and other economic incentives. But the longer-term economic benefits that a peace process could bring are much more significant. The last donor conference to support a peace and transition process in Yemen (in 2012) generated $6.4 billion in promised aid. Potential economic cooperation between Yemen and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) could bring in larger and sustained payoffs.
Yemen’s prospects for economic recovery are also dependent on foreign investment, driven by commercial as well as political considerations. Yemen’s largest and most lucrative industrial projects are controlled by international shareholders. These include the Yemen Liquified Natural Gas (YLNG) project, which has been under force majeure since 2015 but could provide the single largest source of revenue for the government. YLNG’s major shareholders — including French TotalEnergies and U.S. Hunt Oil — want to see greater political stability before they restart production. They also need to be convinced that the Houthis will not engage in the kind of extortion, intimidation, and unlawful seizures that have characterized Houthi interactions with Yemen’s private sector. YLNG export is not feasible as long as the Red Sea is under attack.
Absent such foreign investment, the math simply does not add up. The Houthis have resorted to extreme measures to generate revenues in the areas they control but independent estimates place their revenues at roughly $1.8 billion annually. When the Yemeni government still exported oil, its revenues from areas under its control were approximately $1.4 billion. These levels barely cover Yemen’s public sector salaries — $5.3 billion in 2014 (though inflation brings the U.S. dollar conversion down to $2.1 billion based on the Sanaa exchange rate).
None of these benefits — a donor-backed recovery process, economic cooperation with the GCC, or the return of foreign investment and access to Yemen’s largest peace dividends — will materialize if Yemen remains in a “cold peace” with no internationally backed political resolution, or if the Houthis fail to convince their neighbors that a government they lead can ever be a reliable partner.
The Houthis’ actions threaten to turn Yemen into a pariah state without any viable means for economic recovery, dooming the country to a slow death. Even the short-term benefits provided by a roadmap agreement could disappear if the Houthis’ belligerence drives the United States to re-designate them as a foreign terrorist organization.
With 90% of its basic goods imported, Yemen’s economic recovery also depends on regularizing imports. Addressing Yemen’s food security crisis requires driving down prices by increasing the number of imports and decreasing the costs shippers incur to transport goods. Yet the Houthis’ attacks against ships in the Red Sea are driving up the costs for the few shippers still willing to make the perilous journey, such that Yemenis may be their biggest casualty.
The Houthis’ disregard for international principles even threatens essential humanitarian assistance. After months of negotiations in 2023 and the Houthis’ persistent interference in aid operations, the World Food Program was forced to suspend food aid to millions of Yemenis because the Houthis would not permit it to target aid to those in the greatest need.
Making a choice
Can the Houthis be convinced of the consequences of belligerence against the international community? And do they care? The answer to the first question will depend on whether major international actors (not only the United States) deliver clear, unified messaging regarding the specific consequences the Houthis’ action may trigger. Support from countries like Oman who benefit from relations with the Houthis and would suffer repercussions from further isolation and instability in Yemen is also essential.
Answering the second question is more difficult. Yemeni civilians will suffer most from Yemen’s isolation, but the Houthis will feel the consequences. The Houthis have already found it difficult to maintain control amidst the “no peace, no war” conditions that have persisted since April 2022. Yemen’s private sector has helped push back against bad Houthi decisions in the past, but not ones directly connected to Houthi military strategy. And the loudest voices within the Houthi movement appear to now be military leaders, not those responsible for governing.
The international community must make it clear that the Houthis need to make a decision, but ultimately the choice rests with them."

127,The future of American methane policy,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-future-of-american-methane-policy/,Barry G. Rabe,"September 19, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"The United States has been on the move in recent years to address methane emissions—an intensive, short-lived climate pollutant responsible for about 30% of current global warming. This has been most evident in the oil and gas sector, which contributes about 30% of American and 25% of international methane releases. The U.S. leads the world in the annual production of oil and gas, as well as related methane emissions. How might each of the presidential nominees confront methane issues related to the energy sector? This blog examines prospects under either a Harris administration or a second Trump term.
Many factors have converged in shifting methane from the periphery of climate policy deliberations onto center stage, including its technological implications. Major advances in methane measurement, including satellites and remote sensing, are increasingly supplanting traditional estimation methods. They offer far superior precision than existing techniques, and routinely detect greater emissions than previously disclosed. Numerous technologies to minimize releases are readily available, and many are highly cost-effective when calculating benefits from methane gas capture and use as an energy source. Scholarly analysis and media coverage of methane have proliferated, drawing unprecedented attention to a once-obscure topic.
The topic of methane emissions is not new
Methane is not a new natural resource or environmental concern. A few leading production nations, most notably Norway, many decades ago established effective and durable policies, which have largely eliminated methane loss at or near the point of production. In the U.S., methane governance has long been dominated by production states, many of which have historically maintained very accommodating terms for those firms with poor track records and reluctance toward embracing technologies to tighten measurement or reduce emissions. In Texas, legislative options to capture methane wasted through flaring were first introduced in the 1890s but the state has long struggled to develop an effective mitigation strategy. Obama-era efforts to begin expanding federal oversight faced aggressive responses from the succeeding Trump administration, which largely preserved decentralized governance through the 2010s.
To date, the Biden-Harris administration has pursued an aggressive, multi-faceted approach to methane, both nationally and globally, although this remains a work in progress. Domestically, this has built, in part, on best practices by a number of major production firms and the practices of several exceptional states, particularly Colorado and New Mexico. Following a combination of legislative and executive actions, the federal government is now attempting to stand up a multi-part approach to methane minimization in the oil and gas sectors by simultaneously deploying new pricing, regulatory, and subsidy policy tools.  
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is attempting to implement a legislated fee on methane emissions exceeding a performance standard and linked to a revamped measurement system. This represents the first American price placed on a greenhouse gas. A series of new regulatory provisions are being finalized by the EPA, including expanded leak detection and repair and more consistent use of the latest mitigation technology, covering far more facilities than ever before. Fees can be waived if all production states comply with new regulations through their formal implementation plans. Accredited third-party auditors will be allowed to monitor sites and share findings with EPA for possible enforcement actions. In turn, billions of federal dollars are being invested to assist industry and states with transition costs and remediating long-neglected orphan wells that can seep methane long after active operation. A parallel Bureau of Land Management methane regime is also emerging for oil and gas produced on federal lands, including first-ever royalty payments on methane waste. In turn, new rules to reduce methane loss from pipelines are being developed by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.
These efforts represent a sea change in American methane policy, although little of it will be finalized or operational before the end of the Biden-Harris administration. Implementation will require completion of a very complex suite of policies amid mounting pushback. Nonetheless, if these new provisions are sustained politically, endure legally, and are implemented effectively over time by federal and state agencies, the U.S. could reasonably vault into a global leadership role.
What could the Harris administration do on methane policy?
Kamala Harris has not publicly discussed methane policy since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee. Her most prominent public comments related to energy policy have attempted to explain her pivot away from earlier vows to ban fracking. But it seems quite likely that any administration she steers would continue to pursue the implementation of new policies initiated during her vice presidency. This would entail a massive and sustained administrative lift, requiring considerable expansion of federal and state capacity to measure, monitor, and mitigate emissions while enforcing violations. Mounting political and legal opposition are rapidly emerging from many production state attorneys general, regulatory energy agencies, associations representing oil and gas producers, and members of Congress.  
These steps generate a series of challenging questions that include: Should all states have to fully meet regulatory standards before any are exempt from paying fees? Is the newly proposed measurement system fair to industry or might it result in overcounting emissions after decades of chronic underestimation? Are the EPA’s plans to engage third-party auditors beyond statutory scope? Should states be required to measure methane losses to receive federal grants to plug orphan wells? Should the federal government delay implementation timetables until disagreements can be resolved or give states additional years to formulate compliance plans? Should energy firms that produce relatively small amounts of oil and gas, but have high emission rates, retain historic exemption from regulation? And so on.  
Protracted intergovernmental battles over these and other issues linked to a likely Harris administration methane policy agenda could require many years to resolve. In August 2024, a large coalition of production states and industry sought a Supreme Court stay to freeze EPA methane regulatory development under the Clean Air Act. This contends that the EPA is establishing an “authoritarian national command” violating the cooperative federalism provisions of air quality legislation. Sorting out these disputes and moving some version of these proposed policies into implementation would likely dominate any Harris administration domestic efforts on oil and gas sector methane.
What could a Trump administration do on methane policy?
In contrast, it is somewhat less clear to discern what course a second Trump administration might pursue on methane. Despite his lengthy campaign to regain office, Trump has said nothing publicly about methane. Instead, he has reserved most remarks relevant to climate policy on other issues, including his oft-discussed reservations about electric vehicles, wind turbines, and solar farms. Trump has also vowed repeatedly to pursue all-out oil and gas production and major export expansion, while cultivating heads of production firms for substantial campaign support. At the same time, Trump has disavowed the Project 2025 blueprint to reinvent the American administrative state and has not specified any plans for addressing methane from oil and gas or other sectors. 
Nonetheless, it seems safe to assume that his far-reaching first-term efforts to reverse fledgling Obama-era policy would be a model for his sequel, even in cases where recent legislation (including the 2021 Congressional Review Act and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act) calls for new federal steps to address methane. In a 2020 Brookings book examining the Trump administration’s use of executive power, Frank Thompson, Kenneth Wong, and I characterized its approach to methane as a strategy of “regulatory withdrawal, replacement, repeal, and suspension” of Obama initiatives. As a result, most governmental authority over methane emissions remained in state hands.
These precedents lead to the question of how production firms and states would respond to any second iteration of a Trump administration that could attempt to undo federal policies launched by his immediate predecessor. In the absence of federal oversight, would efforts to more rigorously measure and reduce methane releases diffuse more rapidly and uniformly across the U.S. than they have to date? Thus far, widespread variation in state and industry performance endures and has weakened American claims to international methane leadership.
National performance variation and the modest nature of global authority
There is no singular global authority on methane measurement or policy, but the International Energy Agency (IEA) stands out as an increasingly credible source on global and national emissions measurement. Its 2024 annual report continues a recent pattern of utilizing advanced methods to measure national methane emissions intensity. Consistent with recent years, the findings point to the U.S.’s performance as being well ahead of laggards, such as Russia, Iran, Venezuela, and Turkmenistan. But the nation is still well behind leaders, such as Norway, Saudi Arabia, and Canada. It lands in the middle of the pack among the largest national energy producers, with emissions intensity scores quite close to those of China. In North America, Canada has pursued sustained development and implementation of advanced methane regulations during the past decade, while both America and Mexico have wobbled, which may contribute to its superior performance in recent IEA studies. Legislators from both Europe and the U.S. have called upon IEA to establish international standards for measuring energy sector methane emissions.
Recent reports from the Energy Information Administration indicate declining American venting and flaring rates in recent years, albeit reliant on traditional reporting methods that have historically underestimated emissions and provided limited data on leaks. An ever-growing body of technically advanced scholarly studies find substantial regional variation in methane loss rates. America’s vast physical scale and distribution of production basins leads to lengthy and complicated supply chains which include a diverse tapestry of jurisdictions and private firms. Much production focuses on oil, often leaving associated gas capture a secondary concern unless faced with direct regulatory requirements.
This uneven record undermines U.S. credibility and potential leverage in a sector where its role in production and emissions remains so large globally. A stronger, more consistent domestic record could boost the Global Methane Pledge initiative launched jointly in 2021 by the U.S. and the European Union. This invites national vows to support a 30% reduction in 2020 global methane releases by 2030. The Pledge has secured commitments from 157 nations, although major methane producing nations such as China, India, and Russia have not joined. It could also evolve into an international framework that relies on sophisticated measurement to assess national progress, compels more robust and consistent mitigation policy, and accelerates access to advanced technology globally. Such actions might emulate some of the provisions that have made the 2016 Kigali Amendments to the Montreal Protocol for transforming cooling sector chemicals the global climate policy gold standard. Kigali links technological advancement with sustained implementation of a suite of interwoven regulatory, trade, and funding provisions. Bipartisan legislative steps to support this transition were taken under both Donald Trump and Joe Biden, and it seems plausible that progress would continue under either a President Trump or Harris.
Linkages to cross-border trade
One option for governing methane emissions beyond American borders could link cross-border energy trade with consequences for substandard methane performance. Europe already leads the way in the climate-trade arena, linking its internal carbon pricing system with trade through carbon border adjustments set to begin in 2026. It has also initiated a comparable process to address oil and gas sector methane lost in producing nations before export. Europe intends to combine tougher methane standards on continentally produced energy with comparable requirements for imported energy. This includes possible financial penalties or fees for low performance. Congresswoman Julia Brownley (D-CA) recently introduced the first American “methane border adjustment mechanism” bill for imported energy, leveraging the new U.S. methane fee. This approach remains in very early and uncertain developmental stages but offers a glimpse into what future methane governance might entail if it moves beyond the existing system of non-binding emission reduction pledges.
The Global Methane Pledge, like the Paris Agreement, is not a Senate-backed treaty but merely a presidential executive agreement. Lacking legislative endorsement, it is highly vulnerable to rapid reversal by whomever occupies the Oval Office at a given moment. A second Trump presidency could unilaterally end American engagement in the Pledge, either through formal steps or by simply ignoring it, without offering any replacement. Any Trump efforts to undo the international methane work of his predecessor could also undermine domestic capacity to encourage other producing nations to improve their performance, unless his administration was to unveil some alternative strategy which to date has been kept under wraps.
On the contrary, a Harris administration would likely work to bolster the Pledge and continue recent American initiatives to expand domestic and global efforts to reduce all sources of human-caused methane and other “super pollutants.” However, it would face two major challenges. One, can it stand up its suite of complex domestic policies in a timely, coordinated, and effective fashion and ultimately demonstrate consistent American performance excellence within its boundaries? Two, can it find credible ways to leverage any domestic methane progress with the many nations that continue to lag on methane mitigation?  
A newly-issued report from the Global Carbon Project, an international research entity that monitors climate emissions, concludes that methane emissions from multiple sectors have risen far more rapidly than carbon dioxide in recent decades. The sheer volume of methane emissions and their front-loaded climate warming impacts make them increasingly significant focal points for domestic and international climate policy. These findings should present significant challenges and opportunities for whomever next occupies the presidency."

129,The US-China relationship in 2024 is stabilized but precarious,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/us-china-relations-in-2024-are-stabilized-but-precarious/,Patricia M. Kim,"January 12, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"As the people of Taiwan prepare to select their next president this weekend, all eyes are on Beijing’s reaction to the election results and what this means for U.S.-China relations. Washington and Beijing are acutely aware of the sensitive year ahead, which is why both sides carefully choreographed a smooth summit between Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping in San Francisco last November after relations hit rock bottom following the Chinese spy balloon crisis in early 2023.
While the bilateral summit exceeded expectations — with Beijing promising to curb the export of fentanyl precursors and agreeing to reopen communication channels between the two militaries that it cut after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in 2022 — the summit did not chip away at both sides’ deeply entrenched threat perceptions. It also did not set an ambitious agenda for the year ahead. Rather, the objective was and remains risk management.
The focus on preventing the relationship from spiraling further makes sense, given intense U.S.-China competition. But without a more proactive agenda beyond consultations, not to mention longstanding areas of tension from trade to Taiwan threatening to flare at any moment, both leaders will struggle to convincingly make the case at home that continued diplomacy with the other side is worth the effort and not coming at the expense of national interests.
Deep mutual skepticism remains
The desire to stabilize relations is genuine on both sides. In the days following the San Francisco summit, one felt a palpable sense of relief in both bureaucracies that the meeting, which capped off months of shuttle diplomacy, was a success. During my trip to China in December, nearly everyone I encountered — from policy experts to businesspeople to students and cab drivers — asked whether U.S.-China relations might improve in the coming months. This interest wasn’t surprising given many Chinese believe their country’s development and economic fate still heavily depend on good relations with the United States and the West.
But even as most Chinese support stabilizing ties with the United States, the entrenched view in Beijing and across the broader Chinese public remains that the U.S. desire to preserve its “global hegemony” is depriving “China’s right to develop,” and that no amount of reassurance from Chinese leaders or a change in U.S. administrations will shift Washington’s basic direction.
Negative perceptions of China are also at historic highs among Americans. A poll conducted last fall by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs found that 58% of Americans see “China’s development as a world power” as a serious threat, and only 19% have “a great deal” or “a fair amount” of confidence that China will “responsibly deal with world problems.” A recent bipartisan report released by the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) called on Washington to undertake a “fundamental reevaluation” of its economic relationship with China, asserting that the United States has a twofold choice: either “accept Beijing’s vision of America as its economic vassal” or “stand up for our security, values and prosperity.”
Both political systems understand clearly that the other side is unlikely to budge on key issues. Beijing wants Washington to drop export controls on advanced chips, sanctions on Chinese companies like Huawei, and tariffs on Chinese imports; to curb its support for Taiwan; and to stop criticizing China’s human rights record. Washington wants China to stop coercively advancing its claims vis-à-vis Taiwan and in the East and South China seas, to curtail its unfair trade policies and non-market economic practices, and to drop its strategic partnership with Russia. There is zero chance Beijing or Washington will concede to the other’s demands in the foreseeable future.
The risks of risk aversion
Given this context, neither Washington nor Beijing has high hopes for the bilateral relationship in 2024. As Ambassador Nicholas Burns put it at a Brookings event last month, he is “not optimistic” but “realistic” about the U.S.-China relationship. His comments aptly reflect the sentiment in both capitals.
The upside is that both sides share low expectations — it’s often when expectations are mismatched that there’s turbulence. They are clear-eyed about their differences. Neither Biden nor Xi seeks to trigger a larger conflict, and both leaders have endorsed using working-level exchanges to manage friction.
The downside is that there is little incentive for either side to pursue a more proactive agenda. Such an approach would admittedly be riskier but could give leaders more to point to when skeptics question the utility of maintaining stable ties. As Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen remarked in her speech on the U.S.-China economic relationship last month, “continuing to stabilize our relationship to prevent escalation” is incredibly important, but it “won’t make news.” The pressure will be higher on Biden as the leader of a democracy, who faces political attacks accusing him of pursuing “zombie engagement” and “appeasing” Beijing.
The two lines of cooperation thus far — coordination on counternarcotics and the resumption of military dialogue — are off to a good but complicated start. Beijing has cracked down on the manufacture and export of fentanyl precursors, but experts caution that controlling a fragmented chemical and drug industry will be challenging, disappointing those who seek immediate, comprehensive results. Also, while Beijing has toned down its public remonstrations that Washington is “blaming China for its own fentanyl problem,” the underlying view in China that Beijing is “helping” the United States solve a crisis of its own making creates a shaky foundation for cooperation.
Military-to-military communications have resumed, with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Charles Q. Brown Jr., and his Chinese counterpart, General Liu Zhenli, speaking for the first time in late December. After months of U.S. calls to restore communication channels, the Chinese political system seems to have accepted the dangers of not talking. Among Xi’s “five pillars for China-U.S. relations” that were presented in San Francisco, the second involves “more communications, more dialogues and more consultations” to manage disagreements. But the view in China remains that if Washington would simply “respect China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights,” there would be no need for hotlines or risks of escalation.
In short, both counternarcotics cooperation and military dialogue are still viewed by the Chinese as U.S. asks, benefiting Washington more than Beijing. As such, the temptation for Beijing to walk away when the relationship hits turbulence will be strong.
The upcoming bilateral dialogue on managing artificial intelligence (AI) risks may prove to be a more promising avenue of cooperation with potential discussions on keeping AI out of nuclear command and control systems, among other safety norms. Given the sensitivities around AI technology and binding agreements, it is unclear whether AI cooperation can serve as a bright spot in an otherwise challenged relationship.
Lamentably, Beijing seems to have little interest in coordinating with Washington on global crises, whether on the wars in Ukraine and Israel-Gaza, or North Korea and Iran’s nuclear programs. While the United States and China do not see eye-to-eye on any of these crises, the two states share broad interests in maintaining global stability and preventing proliferation. Beijing’s general posture that Washington is to blame for these conflicts and must first address their “root causes” is wrong and incredibly reckless. The failure of the world’s two greatest powers to coordinate on such pressing challenges casts further doubt on the notion that better U.S.-China relations are good for the two countries and the rest of the world.
Taiwan still looms
Washington and Beijing are wary of potential turbulence following the Taiwan elections, especially as leaders in both capitals face domestic pressure to avoid “looking weak.” China has continued to send military aircraft, naval vessels, and balloons into the Taiwan Strait. Its Taiwan Affairs Office recently denounced Democratic Progressive Party candidate Vice President William Lai, who leads polls, as a “destroyer of peace across the Taiwan Strait.” A Chinese official recently warned that the Taiwanese people must make the “correct choice” if they seek to avoid “war” and “decline.”
While a maximally violent reaction by Beijing in response to the election is looking less likely, Xi and the CCP have already backed themselves into a corner by discrediting Lai as a “troublemaker” and a “separatist.” If Lai wins, Beijing will believe it has no choice but to react to Lai’s every move — his statements, policies, and diplomatic exchanges — that it deems as asserting Taiwan’s independence. If there’s one issue that heightens emotions in China, it’s Taiwan, which disincentivizes moderation below the threshold of war.
In the U.S. political arena, Taiwan has become a litmus test of how tough U.S. leaders are on China. Aggression by Beijing will put pressure on Biden, the GOP candidates, and other U.S. leaders to take higher-profile steps in support of Taiwan, spurring further reactions from Beijing. Such action-reaction dynamics will diminish the prospects for thoughtful discussions in the United States around Taiwan policy amid a shifting military balance in the Taiwan Strait, and limit space for the consideration of reassurance measures by Beijing, Taipei, and Washington for maintaining the cross-Strait status quo.
U.S.-China relations on the brink?
It’s quite possible that another spy balloon-like crisis or escalation in the usual hotspot — whether in the Taiwan Strait or the South or East China seas — could spark a crisis that neither U.S. nor Chinese leaders can easily deescalate given domestic political dynamics. At that point, even if the two sides can avoid a major conflict, the incentives for re-stabilizing the relationship (after two recent failed attempts) will be all but nil, extinguishing prospects for “responsibly managing” U.S.-China competition for at least the near term. A silver lining is that leaders on all sides — in Beijing and Washington, as well as in Taipei — are keenly aware of the fragility of this current moment of stabilization. When challenges arise, as they inevitably will, the hope is that these leaders can act as statesmen, not politicians, to pull the relationship back from the precipice."

Are the sanctions against Russia working?
In his keynote, Singh noted that one of the myths about the current sanctions against Russia is that they have “failed” because they haven’t reversed Russia’s actions, when in fact that was never a stated objective of the sanctions. He elaborated on this point in the Q&A, saying that the sanctions were only one tool in the current strategy and that they were designed with global impacts in mind. “It would feel good to have maximal economic shock and awe all the time, spillover effects and secondary consequences be damned,” Singh said, “but that wouldn’t be the best long-term, risk-adjusted strategy for unity, and it wasn’t sustainable.” As to whether he believed the impact of the sanctions would alter Putin’s calculus to continue the war, Singh said sanctions are “probably a distant second” consideration for Putin when compared with the capture of territory. However, relative to the stated objectives of raising the cost of the war for Russia and giving Ukraine strategic leverage, Singh felt the sanctions were doing their job."
131,The corporate AMT: Understanding low tax liabilities as a policy choice,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-corporate-amt-understanding-low-tax-liabilities-as-a-policy-choice/,Elena Patel,"November 13, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",RESEARCH,"Introduction
There is a long-standing concern that some large, profitable companies pay little to no federal taxes. According to a 2021 report by the Institute on the Taxation and Economic Policy, 55 of the largest corporations in the U.S. paid no federal income tax in 2020 despite reporting substantial pre-tax profit. In response, in 2022 Congress created a corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) to address these disparities.
These concerns, however, are not new. For example, in its 1985 report, “Corporate Taxpayers & Corporate Tax Freeloaders,” Citizens for Tax Justice found that 50 of 275 “highly profitable” companies paid no federal income tax between 1981 and 1984, including Boeing Co., which the report noted earned more than $2 billion in profits over this time period but generated tax refunds totaling $285 million. Results like these led to the expansion of an earlier corporate AMT in the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which lasted until it was repealed in the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA).
The fact that profitable companies sometimes pay no taxes raises fundamental questions about the fairness of the corporate tax system and may raise concerns about potential misconduct. The truth, however, is quite different. Instead, this issue arises from key differences between a corporation’s taxable income, which determines its current tax bill, and its “book” income, which reflects on-going profitability for investors, creditors, and other stakeholders. As discussed below, these measures capture different concepts, and differences are shaped by congressional choices to reduce taxable income to encourage certain business activities. As a result, profitable corporations—those with high book income—often legitimately have low or no taxable income.
As I show in this brief, CAMTs can be designed to ensure that all corporations pay at least a baseline level tax, regardless of any deductions, credits, and deferrals that might otherwise reduce taxes to zero or even below. At the same time, it is important to take a step back and recognize why corporations, whether from time to time or on a persistent basis, can end up in a position where they do not owe federal taxes even if they are completely playing by the rules.1 Low corporate tax liability is a policy choice of the U.S. corporate tax code—a consequence of corporate tax deductions and credits that are designed, for example, to incentivize investment or increase employment. This brief examines the intended role of the AMT in corporate tax policy and its effectiveness in ensuring tax fairness, while also identifying its limitations and potential areas for reform."
132,Netanyahu looks to rejoin a “league of his own”,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/netanyahu-looks-to-rejoin-a-league-of-his-own/,Natan Sachs,"July 25, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to a joint session of Congress occurred on two different levels. There was the substance of the speech itself: a long, impassioned, and detailed defense of Israel as it faces a level of international opprobrium not seen in decades; and there was the political spectacle of the speech—for Israeli and American audiences alike. It was the spectacle that was the real reason it took place.
Netanyahu is an embattled and unpopular leader of a bitterly divided and traumatized country after the atrocities of October 7 and even before. He is working to hold on to power and postpone political reckoning, with several potential coalition crises looming. All this while the country faces a long war on multiple fronts, tens of thousands of Israeli civilians are displaced from border towns, and the politically supercharged plight of 115 remaining Israeli hostages is still unsolved. The widespread international condemnation over the death toll and devastation in Gaza has added to Israelis’ sense of indignation and besiegement, but it offers Netanyahu a political opening as a spokesperson.
Substantively, the speech spanned October 7 through the present, confronting the accusations against Israel, from genocide to being a colonial state. Netanyahu presented several guests he brought with him, including a freed hostage, the grandfather of an Israeli toddler and baby kidnapped to Gaza with their parents, and a Muslim Israeli soldier and an officer of an Ethiopian-Jewish family, both of whom fought on October 7. All were meant to show an Israel that was diverse, deeply wounded, fighting for its defense against what he called the barbarism of Hamas and its surprise attack, and far from the supposedly genocidal aggressor it is accused of being in many quarters.
As he often does, he argued that Israel’s current broad fight against Iran and its proxies is directly tied to an American interest in doing the same. And, most notably in policy terms, he called for a swifter supply of arms to Israel, a line that did not receive much Democratic applause, arguing that that would hasten Israel’s victory and end the war sooner.
Netanyahu gave no hint in the speech as to whether a cease-fire and hostage release deal was imminent, the key policy question at the moment. However, an Israeli delegation is heading back to negotiations and Netanyahu previously told the hostages’ angry families that conditions for a deal were “ripening.” With the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, about to go on recess, there is some chance he would take such a move, should Hamas sign on, despite the risks it poses to his coalition.
Netanyahu also used the speech to try and counter the accusations that he has not laid out a strategic end game for the war, thereby damaging the war effort itself and contributing to the devastation Israel’s operation has wrought. He said his plan—though still woefully short on detail and extremely late—was a demilitarized, de-radicalized Gaza, governed by Palestinians who were not committed to fighting Israel, and secured by Israel itself.
 A “league of his own”
The substance of the speech would be a salve to many Israelis, who feel deeply and unfairly maligned, and to their supporters. But the speech was meant, first and foremost, as several political theaters wrapped in one: a political act for Netanyahu, for Republicans in Congress, and, against their wishes, for Democrats.
Having failed to receive an invitation to the White House since he formed his current right-to-extreme-right coalition with a radical domestic agenda, Netanyahu got an invitation from Congress, the alternative route to Washington which he used in 2015. It was the image he craved: him, fighting on the highest global stages for Israel’s (and his) reputation, to the sound of applause.
In Israel’s tumultuous recent years, with repeated elections, Netanyahu campaigned with giant billboards showing him shaking the hands of world leaders above the slogan “a league of his own.” The subtext was that no other Israeli politician could operate on the international stage as Netanyahu does. His speech in Congress was, in a sense, his application to be readmitted to that league of his own in his voters eyes.
Netanyahu was leaning on his original political skill, the one that propelled him to the national stage: making Israel’s case in pristine English and American-style, sound-bite-ready delivery. At the Madrid peace conference of 1991, the 42-year-old Netanyahu stood out as the Israeli delegation’s most capable international spokesperson, catapulting him to the leadership of his party two years later and the prime minister’s office in 1996.
This political tool, however, is likely insufficient for Netanyahu by itself. He has a great deal of political ammunition left—in particular, the fact that elections are not mandated for two more years—but his coalition remains shaky, and he is a known quantity, his oratory ability already baked into his polling numbers.
Democratic wedge, Republican hammer
For the Republican leadership, the speech was an easy, though limited, win. It was an attempt to drive deeper the wedge among Democrats who are today divided on Israel and between them and the median American voter. Every time House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries had to awkwardly decide whether to applaud or rise to his feet alongside Republican lawmakers was a small success for Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson. Indeed, when Netanyahu went on the offensive, calling out American protesters and even university leaders, he was touching on issues that divide the Democratic base, creating a minor live-streamed headache for at least some of the Democratic lawmakers in an election year.
Here too, though, it is hard to see the speech as a political coup for Republicans. It was a headache for Democrats, but it was overshadowed by the political drama of the past few weeks in the United States, including an assassination attempt on a candidate, the withdrawal of another, and the likely ascension of a third. Americans, just like Israelis and all others, find their own affairs most interesting of all, and the speech, at the end of the day, was secondary news for the American public.
There was another Republican angle for Netanyahu. Donald Trump, who may return to the Oval Office in a matter of months, had been furious with Netanyahu for the sin of congratulating Joe Biden on his election victory, even while Trump was still falsely claiming the elections were rigged. Netanyahu went out of his way in the speech to name and thank Trump for his support of Israel. Yet he also tried to allay, somewhat, the perception that he was siding with Republicans by thanking Biden and lawmakers from “all sides” of the aisle for their support of Israel since October 7.
This is the flipside of Netanyahu’s ability to perform on such a stage. He is unmatched in Israel in this skill, but he is also unmatched in the polarization he has created around Israel in the United States. Indeed, Vice President Kamala Harris was in Indiana at the time of the speech for a pre-scheduled event. She was thus unavailable to preside over the Senate, where she would have found herself in every frame behind Netanyahu, her every expression or decision to applaud or abstain from it monitored by millions. In 2015, then-Vice President Joe Biden was also traveling and unavailable for Netanyahu’s speech against the Obama administration’s Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (the “Iran deal”).
Harris was and is walking a fine line. She has repeatedly voiced her support for Israel and its right to defend itself. She has championed the cause of Israeli hostages and victims of sexual violence since October 7. Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff has been active in the administration’s national strategy to combat antisemitism, which has become far more prevalent in the Jewish experience in recent months. Harris has been a staunch support of Israel, much like President Biden.
At the same time, Harris has also been a prominent voice at the top of the administration raising concern about Israel’s conduct in the war and the immense cost in life and infrastructure in the Gaza Strip. She has spoken out against the rise in Islamophobia. And most consequently for the actual conduct of the war, hers was one of the more strident voices among senior administration officials in direct communications with Israeli leaders.  
That stance—some, though not much, distance from Biden, especially on the plight of Gazans, while maintaining a traditional embrace of Israel as an ally—is likely the political approach Harris will aim to maintain for the campaign. I suspect that this is also her genuine inclination, which may continue after January, were she elected.
Yet Democratic or Republican considerations were not Netanyahu’s main concern, for better or worse. Very few Democrats or Republicans are eligible to vote in Israeli elections. Indeed, Netanyahu did not come to Washington to meddle with American presidential politics. Rather, Netanyahu was trying to use the U.S. congressional setting for Israeli politics."

134,Introduction,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/introduction-usmca-forward-2024/,"Joshua P. Meltzer, Brahima Sangafowa Coulibaly","March 6, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",RESEARCH,"It has been three and a half years since USMCA was signed, ushering in a new era in North American economic cooperation. The passage of USMCA though U.S. Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support also signaled a new economic and political reality and an opportunity to reset the conversation around what can be achieved collectively. The coming into effect of USMCA also paralleled other important developments globally, including rising competition with China and Russian aggression in Ukraine that drew attention to the risks of economic engagement with adversaries. The pandemic also highlighted the fragility of global value chains as well as the resilience of regional supply chains. For example, dependency on China for medical equipment revealed risks for North America while the success of North American supply chains helped to mitigate the risks.
We established the Brookings USMCA initiative shortly after passage of USMCA with the goal of building an evidence base to understand the impact of USMCA for trade, investment, and jobs, and in turn, develop a pathway for how USMCA can help build more competitive, inclusive, and sustainable North American economic relations.
Any assessment of how USMCA is doing so far must start with the growth in trade and investment across North America which has reached record highs, with $1.8 trillion in total trade supporting approximately 17 million jobs. Mexico and Canada are the U.S.’ top trading partners, with the U.S. trading more with Mexico now than with China. A lot of this trade is also generated by movement of goods and services across complex supply chains that produce automobiles, medical equipment, and information technology (IT). USMCA has enabled the extensive trade and investment ties by reducing trade barriers along with regulatory cooperation. USMCA is also an increasingly important source of geopolitical strength. As the U.S. aims to make supply chains more resilient, expand manufacturing of semiconductors, and invest in clean energy and batteries, new and long-term investments will be needed. USMCA can reduce investment risk and increase the attractiveness of investing in North America by creating stability and predictability, a key theme reflected in this report. Moreover, the Biden administration’s view of national security as encompassing economic security underscores how USMCA’s role in building economic security by ensuring supply chain resilience and enabling de-risking of trade with China by reshoring critical supply chains into North America, means that USMCA also strengthens U.S. national security.
This report is the Brookings USMCA initiative’s third annual flagship publication. This report includes thematic-focused chapters from subject matter experts as well as viewpoints from senior government officials and leaders from business and civil society. The report takes stock of the state of the North American relationship and looks at how the three parties, including business and civil society, can further leverage USMCA to strengthen economic relations in the lead up to the joint review in 2026. The USMCA joint review requires that by July 2026 all parties agree to renew USMCA. Failure to renew the agreement in 2026 will lead to an annual joint review that could continue for up to 10 years, and the absence of agreement by all parties to renew USMCA within that timeframe will lead to the agreement’s termination in 2036. This report includes a chapter by Joshua P. Meltzer and Steve Verheul on how to use the mandated joint review productively and in ways that fulfill the original intentions of the negotiators of keeping USMCA up to date. It also argues for swift renewal of USMCA in 2026 to avoid rising uncertainty and reduced trade and investment that would follow. As Goldy Hyder, President and CEO of the Business Council of Canada, points out, failure to renew USMCA “would discourage capital investment, foreign and domestic,” and undermine the very thing that is a source of geopolitical stability.
There are a three key themes in this year’s report that form the backdrop for maximizing the USMCA opportunity—and where progress in the lead up to USMCA renewal in 2026 will be important. The first is the key role of the USMCA labor provisions and their effective implementation. The second is how USMCA can further enable the transition to renewable energy and build a more digitally capable North American economy. The third is the role of USMCA and compliance with USMCA rules as key sources of predictability and stability.
We are honored this year to include chapters from prominent academics and other thought leaders as well as viewpoints from senior government leaders including U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Katherine Tai, Canadian Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Jonathan Wilkinson, Governor of Chihuahua María Eugenia Campos Galván, Mexican Chief Officer for North America, civil society leaders such as American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFLCIO) President Liz Shuler, and business leaders including President of the American Chamber of Commerce Suzanne P. Clark, President and CEO of the Business Council of Canada Goldy Hyder, Otis CEO and Business Roundtable Chair of Trade and International Committee Judy Marks, as well as CEOs from all three countries.
USMCA and labor
One of the areas of focus in this report is the USMCA labor chapter. This chapter is one of the key developments that distinguishes USMCA from NAFTA. The importance of the USMCA labor chapter is hard to overstate. Its inclusion helped secure the support of Congressional Democrats, and it led to the AFL-CIO also backing the USMCA—the first time the AFL-CIO backed a trade agreement since the Johnson administration in the 1960s. As noted by Ambassador Tai, “the Rapid Response Mechanism is a main reason the revamped USMCA gained the support of many members of U.S. Congress who have opposed free trade agreements.”
The labor chapter includes commitments by the parties to various labor rights and their enforcement, including freedom of association and elimination of forced labor. Implementing these commitments is now seen by many as the litmus test of how trade can support better outcomes for labor both in terms of labor rights and wages. In this respect, the chapter’s innovative rapid response mechanism (RRM) is ground zero for proving the chapter’s effectiveness. Indeed, Liz Shuler highlights the importance of the labor chapter and the RRM for the ongoing support of the AFL-CIO, referring to the RRM as “a notable bright spot.” The RRM allows one country to raise instances of non-compliance with the labor chapter at specific facilities of another country and develop a plan to remediate these issues with that government. Failure to remediate violations allows one of the other governments to impose tariffs or other penalties on exports from that facility. While the RRM is reciprocal, in practice it is only available for use by the U.S. and Canada against facilities in Mexico, and there is no RRM mechanism between the U.S. and Canada.
The various contributions In this report on USMCA and labor show that the impact of the USMCA labor chapter on labor rights and wages in Mexico is complex. Part of the complexity is due to Mexico’s labor reforms, including developing new laws and institutions to adjudicate labor disputes and oversee labor contracts, which were enacted around the time when USMCA came into effect. The chapter from Alfredo Domínguez Marrufo, General Director of the Federal Center for Conciliation and Labor Registration of Mexico, analyzes Mexico’s labor reforms and shows how the USMCA commitments on labor have complemented domestic reforms such as new labor courts, dispute resolution mechanisms, and establishment of the Federal Center for Conciliation and Labor Registration to monitor and regulate labor contracts and strengthen union participation. Domínguez makes clear that the process of implementing labor reforms is ongoing and will take time. Liz Shuler in her viewpoint also underscores the importance of implementing USMCA labor commitments while recognizing that in Mexico “the growth of mature industrial relations and the rule of law is a project that will take decades, not years.”
The RRM has been a focus for the U.S. Trade Representative when it comes to demonstrating that the USMCA labor commitments can lead to positive outcomes. Kathleen Claussen in her chapter analyzes the effectiveness and operation of the RRM. Similar to Domínguez, Claussen agrees that the USMCA labor chapter has interacted with Mexico’s domestic labor reforms in largely positive ways, strengthening Mexico’s labor reform efforts, particularly in states where implementation of domestic labor reforms has been slow. However, Claussen also observes that the RRM needs to remain a complement to Mexico’s domestic reform and enforcement capacities and should not replace the institution building that is underway in Mexico. Claussen makes some recommendation to improve the operation of the RRM, such as more transparency and information sharing with companies where claims are being made.
Expectations differ on the impact of the labor chapter on Mexico’s wages. Liz Shuler emphasizes the need to close the wage gap between manufacturing workers in the U.S. and Mexico. This is indeed an important goal but one that the USMCA labor chapter is unlikely to have much impact on. Santiago Levy in the USMCA Forward 2022 report devoted a chapter to the impact of the USMCA labor chapter on average wage rates in Mexico and found that in the absence of reform to Mexico’s social security laws it is unlikely that USMCA will lead to higher average wages. Addressing low wage rates in Mexico is nevertheless important and is raised by Luz María de la Mora and Governor María Eugenia Campos Galván, who highlight the need to increase the productivity of Mexican workers with improved training. The need to reform Mexico’s education system and worker training programs was addressed by Sylvia Ortega in her contribution to the USMCA Forward 2023 report.
USMCA opportunities and new issues: energy and digital technologies
A second main theme in this report focuses on key opportunities that are regional and therefore require a coordinated North American solution that USMCA can facilitate as part of the agenda for the upcoming joint review. In this regard, the transition to clean energy and a more digitally enabled North American economy stand out. Oscar Ocampo outlines a once in a lifetime opportunity to build a clean energy system across North America and a more integrated North American energy market that strengthens energy security and expands production of critical minerals and batteries. Similarly, José Zozaya and Odracir Barquera highlight the role of USMCA in the transition to electric vehicles.
The transition to renewable energy is well underway in Canada as outlined by Minister Wilkinson, and in the U.S., this transition has been given a huge boost with the Inflation Reduction Act. Yet, and as Ocampo points out, “Mexico’s energy sector is in disarray” due to the Andrés Manuel López Obrador administration’s energy policies that have sought to position PEMEX as the leading supplier of carbon intensive energy at the cost of private sector investment into renewable energy. This includes the administration’s undermining of the federal electricity Commission (CFE) as the independent energy regulator. Moreover, delays permitting new transmission lines has led to under investment in Mexico’s energy sector just when investment opportunities are generated by the IRA and Chips Act. For many companies, access to low carbon energy is also important to meet climate goals.
Ocampo identifies various ways to increase access to clean energy with more crossborder energy cooperation. For example, the new transmission line between Quebec and New York to deliver clean energy demonstrates the win-win nature of crossborder energy trade. In addition, building a more integrated North American energy market requires technical level cooperation to develop common standards such as for transnational energy infrastructure. Minister Wilkinson underscores the need for significant new investments to facilitate the transition to clean energy, and the importance of USMCA in providing the certainty and business environment that can reduce risk and enable these investments.
Alejandra Palacios and Christian Norton’s contribution focuses on the opportunities for North America to expand trade and cooperation in digital technologies, strengthen regulatory cooperation, and harmonize regulation of the digital economy across the region. The USMCA digital trade chapter is one of the most advanced on digital trade and regulatory cooperation. USMCA already includes commitments to cooperation in cybersecurity and privacy regulation, but more engagement on these issues is needed. There are other areas important for the digital economy where USMCA has little to say but where cooperation is also needed, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance and export controls of sensitive technologies. Blanca Treviño highlights the need to do more with the USMCA in AI governance and cybersecurity. Palacios and Norton argue that establishing a North American digital trade forum is needed as a focal point for cooperation on digital issue, and a similar recommendation was made by Patrick Leblond in his chapter on digital trade for the USMCA Forward 2022. Progress on these fronts would strengthen outcomes in terms of the digital trade opportunities but also ensure appropriate digital regulation and trust.
USMCA as a source of stability in a turbulent world
There are two ways that USMCA creates stability and predictability in North American economic relations. The first is through the regular meetings among government officials, business, and civil society, and the second is through USMCA dispute settlement. A chapter co-authored by three former ambassadors from each country discusses the significance of the increasingly dense web of meetings and processes for cooperation in developing trust. USMCA mandates regular committee meetings to oversee the functioning of the agreement and to identify and resolve potential trade issues. USMCA includes a commitment to annual ministerial level meetings of the Free Trade Commission (FTC) which sets the agenda and direction for future work on USMCA. For instance, the last meeting of the USMCA FTC in August 2023 decided to expand the benefits of the USMCA by strengthening competitiveness and increasing the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and underrepresented communities.1
These USMCA focused meetings are complemented by other high-level bilateral and trilateral meetings among government officials and between business leaders, including the North American Leaders Summit, the U.S.-Mexico High Level Economic Dialogue, and the U.S.-Canada Roadmap for Renewed U.S.-Canada Partnership. Similar dialogues on the industry side focus on deepening economic cooperation across the region. Roberto Velasco, the Chief Officer for North America in the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in his viewpoint underscores the importance of these trilateral and bilateral initiatives that complement engagement under USMCA.
The three authors of this chapter also identify how USMCA meetings and the broader range of interactions across government, industry, and civil society could be used to expand the benefits of USMCA to small businesses and to build a more robust competitiveness and innovation agenda. Indeed, a common theme in this report is that deepening cooperation across North America is needed to strengthen the competitiveness of the region. As Suzanne P. Clark, President of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, outlines, a competitiveness agenda should include workforce development and increasing investment into critical sectors such as energy. According to Judy Marks, the USCMA is needed to incentivize further economic integration and development of sectoral supply chain ecosystems to boost competitiveness. For her part, Luz María underscores the important role that Mexico can play in bolstering the region’s supply chain, leveraging its cheap labor and providing an alternative to China-centered supply chains. Similarly, Galván also highlights the opportunities to further deepen and grow the trade and investment relationship across North America.
Another important part of USMCA is the reforms to its various dispute settlement mechanisms. Robert Howse, Professor of International Law at NYU Law School, analyzes these developments, describing the changes to the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism and the reforms to the state-to-state system that has led to it being used eight times. Howse observes that the renewed functioning of USMCA state-state dispute settlement demonstrates a real commitment by each government to using USMCA to settle disputes. Yet, a common theme in this report is that instances of non-compliance with dispute settlement decisions reduce the ability of USMCA to provide certainty and predictability for traders and investors. Indeed, the Brookings USMCA initiative’s scorecard which tracks compliance with USMCA shows all three governments at various stages of non-compliance, with Mexico being the most non-compliant, followed by the U.S., and then Canada.
Howse recognizes the important role of dispute settlement and compliance in creating certainty and predictability. He also observes how state-state USMCA disputes often engage complex commercial and other government interests that affect how each government responds to dispute settlement decisions. While failure to comply with a USMCA dispute, such as U.S. non-compliance with the USMCA decision on auto rules of origin, creates uncertainty for business, Howse argues that instances of non-compliance also need to be understood in the context of complex multidimensional relationships that might counsel against an overly confrontational stance on trade and investment, rather than as a systemic disregard of USMCA commitments.
This report is being released in advance of elections in the U.S. and Mexico this year and in Canada in 2025. The outcomes of these elections will undoubtedly have important implications for the future of USMCA, for North American relations, and for the joint review in 2026. This report underscores the enormous benefits that the USMCA has produced for businesses and workers as well as its role in strengthening the hand of the U.S. in its geopolitical competition with China and lays out an agenda to further strengthen economic relations. These are goals that should be worth pursuing, irrespective of who leads each country."

A Brookings debate,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/does-the-wests-ukraine-policy-need-a-reality-check-a-brookings-debate/,"Constanze Stelzenmüller, Aslı Aydıntaşbaş, Michael E. O’Hanlon, Steven Pifer, Melanie W. Sisson, Angela Stent, Tara Varma","February 15, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"As the second anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine draws near, the outlook appears bleak: both sides have sustained horrific losses, millions of Ukrainians remain displaced or in exile, and there is no plausible sign of an end to the violence. Western capitals are struggling to supply funds and ammunition to Kyiv, while the Kremlin seemingly draws on limitless supplies and political support from authoritarian allies and continues to pound Ukrainian cities to rubble. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, says he would “encourage [Russia] to do whatever the hell they want” to NATO allies that spend insufficiently on defense, while Russian President Vladimir Putin threatens Poland and the Baltics in an interview with Tucker Carlson.
Six Brookings scholars (Aslı Aydıntaşbaş, Michael E. O’Hanlon, Steven Pifer, Melanie W. Sisson, Angela Stent, and Tara Varma) debate the questions Ukraine and its supporters now face:
Is Russia winning its war against Ukraine? Should the United States and its allies push Ukraine to negotiate with Russia?
How can the United States and its allies best ensure security and stability in Ukraine and Europe? Should NATO take further steps toward Ukrainian membership at its 75th-anniversary summit in Washington in July?
What concrete steps should the United States and Europe take in 2024 to prevent a Ukrainian defeat? What would the consequences of a Russian victory be for the trans-Atlantic alliance?
These are hard questions, with no easy answers; the authors disagree with each other, and some of the disagreements remain unresolved. But the one thing we all agree on is: rarely in living memory has so much been at stake, not just for Ukraine, but for Europe and the Western alliance. And, arguably, for Russia too.

138,Protecting Underseas Cables,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/protecting-underseas-cables/,,"August 17, 2024",BROOKINGS,"Washington, D.C",COMMENTARY,"On August 16, 2024 the Congressional Study Group on Foreign Relations and National Security convened virtually to discuss threats to underseas telecommunications cables and strategies Congress may consider for protecting them. Our modern global telecommunications system is built in substantial part on massive networks of underseas cables that connect various corners of the world. These networks have never been more economically or politically important. Yet these cables are governed by an antiquated international legal framework, even as they are under new threats by state actors—including China and Russia—that seem increasingly intent on surreptitiously tapping into or even disrupting them in order to secure a strategic advantage over their rivals.
The study group was joined by three experts for this session:
Jennifer Counter, vice president at Orbis Operations and a nonresident senior fellow in the Forward Defense practice at the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security;
Kevin Frazier, assistant professor at St. Thomas College of Law and a current Tarbell fellow at Lawfare; and
Amy Paik, an incoming fellow at the Wilson Center, associate research fellow at the Korea Institute for Defense Analysis, and fellow at the John Hopkins University School of Advanced and International Studies.
 Prior to the discussion, the study group circulated the following background readings:
Kevin Frazier, “On Protecting the Undersea Cable System,” Lawfare (Jan. 12, 2023);
Jill Gallagher and Nicole Carter, “Protection of Undersea Telecommunications Cables: Issues for Congress,” Congressional Research Service (Aug. 7, 2023);
Amy Paik and Jennifer Counter, “International Law Doesn’t Adequately Protect Undersea Cables. That Must Change,” The Atlantic Council (Jan. 25, 2024); and
“How to Protect Undersea Cables with Kevin Frazier,” Lawfare Daily (May 24, 2024) (podcast).
Paik began the discussion by emphasizing the critical role of undersea cables, noting that 95% of internet traffic and over ten trillion USD worth of financial transactions rely on these cables. She highlighted various case studies demonstrating the severe consequences of cable disruptions, such as the February 2023 Matsu Island blackout, which left 13,000 residents without power for 50 days after cables were damaged. Additionally, Paik discussed evidence that countries like Russia are investing in and testing submarine capabilities to sever cables in hard-to-detect locations, as illustrated by the 2019 Losharik incident, where a Norwegian cable was cut by the Russian Losharik vessel. While the Russian Defense Ministry claimed the cut was due to a fire on the vessel, other authorities suspect it was a deliberate act.
Paik explained that key provisions of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) help define a legal framework for this issue. UNCLOS Article 87 ensures the freedom of the High Seas and grants all states the right to install submarine cables. Additionally, Article 113 requires states to enact laws to prevent the destruction of submarine cables but does not impose any affirmative obligation to protect them. Therefore, under UNCLOS, unless individual countries enact binding domestic laws to safeguard undersea cables, there is little hope for this international agreement to do so.
Paik raised that there is a gap in international law: What happens if a cable is physically damaged by an aggressor on the High Seas? Unless damage occurs in a country’s Exclusive Economic Zone (UNCLOS Article 57), it is impossible to hold an aggressor state or state-sponsored attacker accountable for an incident in the the High Seas, which is the core problem necessitating an international regulatory regime (Paik 2023). The crux of the issue is that if a cable is broken or damaged by an actor, the state under whose flag the ship operates or the actor’s state of citizenship has jurisdiction to address the injury. Therefore, Paik recommends that jurisdiction should be shared between the cable owner’s and attacker’s states to create a stronger deterrent. Knowing they may be more vulnerable to accountability in the cable owner’s court, potential perpetrators—likely from states with advanced submarines—might reconsider before attempting sabotage.
Counter then outlined the broader political landscape surrounding these issues. She noted that states adversarial to the United States do not approach such issues with the same level of review, scrutiny, and bureaucracy that is expected of American government today. Counter cited examples like the 2017 assassination attempt in North Korea using VX gas to show that adversaries are willing to take significant risks that the heavily regulated U.S. government would avoid. Thus, she argued that more creative thinking is necessary to protect cables.
Counter further explained that while cable cutting would indeed be a significant nuisance to the U.S. and Europe, which are well connected with redundant cables, smaller island nations and countries might experience a complete shutdown if even a single line is severed. If such a cut is not quickly repaired, it could lead to distrust in the government and potentially cause unrest. She argued that it is time to think seriously about how to protect cables—not just for our own purposes (e.g., maintaining internet access) but also to protect our allies and guard against threats from China, Russia, and Iran. A modern international agreement to prevent malicious activities would be a good starting point.
Frazier elaborated on congressional actions related to undersea cables. The 2022 Don Young Coast Guard Authorization Act acknowledges significant concerns about the damage caused by anchors dropped on cables and prohibits vessels from coming too close to undersea cables. However, this provision may be challenging to enforce in practice: As we continue to lay more cables, the risk of damage increases. Additionally, there is the Cable Ship Security Program, through which Congress has funded two privately owned U.S. ships tasked with repairing hundreds of cables that carry U.S. traffic. However, Frazier emphasized that as both the number of cables on the ocean floor and the capabilities to disrupt them increase, far more repair ships will be required.
Frazier also noted that penalties for disrupting a cable are outlined in the 1884 Convention on the Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables. If an injury is intentional, the fine is $500; if caused by neglect, the fine may not exceed $500. These penalties are insufficient, as corporations are unlikely to be deterred by these relatively small fines.
Frazier proposed four basic solutions: (1) Increase funding for existing regulatory regimes, such as the Don Young Act, to better monitor where vessels are anchoring; (2) enhance congressional oversight to ensure that repair ships are equipped to succeed in their tasks and to spur increased investment in a cable repair fleet; (3) expand the scope and scale of the Cable Security Program; and (4) increase penalties for cable damage.
Next, Frazier suggested some more innovative solutions. The U.S. could establish a cable protection zone, designating areas where naval traffic is prohibited. This measure has been adopted by Australia and New Zealand, with more success in the latter due to its smaller number of cables. However, this solution may not be ideal for the U.S., which has many cables to protect. Alternatively, a viable solution could be to ensure that all future cables are laid in a specific zone, facilitating monitoring to prevent damage. Moreover, these cables could be hidden from anyone outside those involved in their installation and their respective governments, an idea promoted by former British Prime Minister Sunak. The tradeoff here is that if the cable locations are kept secret, there is no way to prevent players from mistakenly dropping anchors.
Frazier advanced that the best solution would be to lay smart cables equipped with sonar to detect breaks easily, to enhance our intelligence capabilities, and to expand our fleet of cable repair ships. Lastly, there must be a robust intelligence network focused on undersea cable protection that is consistently shared among American allies.
The study group then concluded with an open discussion session, during which attendees were free to comment on and pose questions regarding the various issues raised.
